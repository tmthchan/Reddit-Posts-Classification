I am earning very little at the moment but I wanted to know which stock is best to put the little money I have ($300) into instead of putting it into a bank as a deposit.

stocks,"Dad told me to sell on Monday when the market was red b/c I had already profited on some. Was that the correct choice? The stocks I chose were aapl, net, asts, icln, jnj, and txn. My dad pointed out on the charts, the previous earnings showed the price would drop anyways and to sell (net and aapl were the ones he looked at). Aapl was at $141, which was $12 in the green from when I purchased it, as were a lot if the other stocks I listed. He told me to take the profit while I could. Is what he said correct?

I know tech is considered overvalued right now, but on the graph, aapl is still on the uptrend for the time being. I think I sold too soon even though I made a profit."
stocks,"Merger/accusation question about a game co. And a theater co. Retail owns the companies so it could happen if we chose.  My question is, is it a catalyst for a squeeze?

My understanding is this would give excellent reason for a share RECALL.  I know a recall could be denied but that is news that might make it out of finance.

The recall would cause a squeeze wouldn’t it?

stocks,"Best Software to Track Trades and Create Reports Hi,

I'm looking for the best software to track stock trades and create reports to help develop greater insight into what to do, and what not to do, given current market conditions. I've ruled out all websites because they try to get you to pay $80+/month in a never ending subscription. 

No. Way.

The only way to go, without being completely ripped off, is an application that you can install on your computer. I've found one called ""TradingDiary Pro,"" which is $150 to buy, and $50/year thereafter for maintenance. I've kicked the tires a bit, and it looks pretty good. The only problem is that it's a Windows application, so if you've got a Mac, the only way to run it is under Parallels or VMWare.

It's hugely important to have software like this to know what's going well and what's not. It can literally give you an edge. 

I'm using TradingDiary's 30-day demo, and I'm considering buying it. Is there anything better out there that anyone knows about? (Again, please: no websites. They are all massive rip-offs.) 

Thanks,

Artem"
stocks,"After Driving My Friends Tesla, Here Are My Thoughts: (Bullish Tesla) I'm not a car guy and I'm not an EV guy.  Def not a Tesla dude.   

I had an opportunity to drive my friends new Tesla, not sure which model, but it was roomy and classy.  It's not the performance that makes me LONG on Tesla, but the insight that this is the Apple brand but for the car people.  Apple lovers are loyal as are Tesla.  If I'm speaking redundancy, I apology, but it makes sense now.

stocks,"Clearing up confusion about Fidelity I see everyone talking about heading to fidelity because they don’t participate in PfoF. This is true. But one thing that is being misrepresented, or rather “omitted”, is that Fidelity does indeed use their own dark pool to trade block orders to institutional investors.  More than a third of Fidelity’s daily orders qualify as a block order and they could, at their own discretion, send those buy orders through their dark pool directly to institutionals. 

Just be aware that they could be participating in a way that affects certain stocks unfavorably for retail investors.

stocks,"WISH: A Management Play *I will publish an in-depth analysis/DD later focused on financial data but here is a starter. Long story short, I think Wish is in the right industry (ecommerce is still growing fast), fairly priced to undervalued, and is a great management play. I will explain the management part here.*

**Why I am extremely bullish on WISH?**

Jacqueline D. Reses has been newly appointed as the executive chairman of Wish. She has previously worked for **Goldman Sachs** in M&amp;A and investments (7 years), **Alibaba**, where she helped lead its IPO (2 years), **Yahoo!** (4 years), **Square** where she managed Square Capital, the company’s start-up small-business lending program. (6 years), **Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco** to serve the Economic Advisory Council (6 years). She is also a board member of **Pershing Square Tontine Holdings** since July 2020. Even though the deal through PSTH has been cancelled, it's Jackie who introduced Bill Ackman to Vivendi, she has a lot of connections when it comes to finance and in business in general.

**Jackie will get a 8-figure net worth if the stock reaches $18-$36 by mid-2023.**

I was doing my research and reading some SEC filings from Wish parent company (Context Logic) and found some golden nuggets. According to an 8-K Form from May, 2021: Jacqueline D. Reses have a not-so-mind-blowing base salary of $35K/year. Keep in mind that her net worth is over $50M.

Let's go back a bit. While Jacqueline has always been wealthy, she built \~90%+ of her net worth by working for Square through performance-based salary (i.e. paid by SQ stocks if financial targets were met). Guess what? **She's doing it again with Wish.** And assuming her net worth is currently at around $60M, she has the opportunity to double it through performance-based vested stocks.

If my calculations are correct, she could double her wealth if the stock price of Wish hits 36$ by mid-2023: *Target of 200% vested \[300%\] \* closing stock price on April 20, 2021 \[$12.07\] = $36.21→ At this price, Jacqueline D. Reses could hypothetically sell her performance-based shares for a total of $60M.*

Here is the targets (WISH stock price) and what she could vest.

|Stock Price Multiple ($) based on closing stock price on April 20, 2021|Portion of the stocks Jacqueline will be able to vest out of the 828,5K shares|

|178%|50%|
|207%|100%|
|\&gt;298%|200%|

**There you go: Jacqueline is a very experienced executive, has a powerful professional network &amp; her incentives are clearly aligned with the company's targets.**

**Price target(s)**: From $18 to $36 by May 15, 2023 or before (20 months max.), which implies a valuation of about $11B to $22B (the IPO was at a $14B valuation). Note that options expiring after 2023 for the stock do not exist yet. And as always this is not financial advice."

I'm trying to find a solution to do as I stated above though on orders that are not day trades, so even if I switched to a brokerage that offered bracket orders on day trades, it doesn't seem that would help as it's impossible to monitor the number of stocks I'm not I want to swing trade to see if I need to switch a stop loss order to a limit order based on it's movement.

stocks,"$INTZ Intrusion cyber security closed at $4.26 with the nearest PT at $13.5. Sharing this (gem?) here for you. Intrusion (A cyber security company) dropped 50% today due to CEO leaving and slightly ""less good"" revenue compared to what to be expected.

It will still be a revenue close to the same amount as last quarter, also a new CEO will be installed within a short period of time.

It feels like the shareholders overreacted and the low float was affected today. That was what Ibpersonally saw happening today.

Price Targets from official analytics is $13.50, $19.25 and $25. Today's close was $4.26. We are talking about a potential 200% upside.

A reason for today's fall: Intrusion said its Shield Cybersecurity solution ""experienced a slower-than-anticipated sales ramp due to longer customer evaluation cycles typically seen in most enterprise security sales organizations.""

About $INTZ Intrusion Inc: Intrusion is engaged in developing, marketing, and supporting a group of high-speed data mining, cybercrime and advanced persistent threat detection products. The company’s product line includes TraceCop which is utilized as a big data tool with IP intelligence to support forensic investigations while Savant is a network data mining and advanced persistent threat detection software utilized for data privacy protection.

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Tuesday, July 20, 2021 **PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, July 20, 2021**

Today, the market pulled a remarkable reversal and clawed back most of the losses from yesterday, one of the worst days for the three major indexes all year. Despite fears surrounding the coronavirus delta variant and potential inflationary pressures, the volume of buys going into the major indexes yesterday suggest market participants remain unperturbed and eager to buy up any significant dips in the market. If anything, today teaches us not to succumb too quickly to fear, uncertainty, and doubt. Today reinforces the remarkable strength of the markets in the US. Potential risks will always be present in the market, and one always has to be prepared to act in case of a downturn, but one shouldn’t make decisions based on fear. We have seen dips like this in the past before the year, yet the three main indexes continue their monster uptrend. The Russell 2000 (IWM) broke it’s downtrend and outperformed, climbing roughly 3% today. In other news, Q2 earnings season continues and is shaping up to be another record breaking quarter.

Yesterday, it seems fears surrounding the coronavirus delta variant came to a head, with LA county reinstating its mask mandate and the Japanese government reportedly discussing potentially cancelling the Olympics after a slew of infections among athletes and staff. In the US, despite roughly 50% of the population being vaccinated, in the past two weeks, infections across the country have roughly doubled, with cases jumping from 13,200 on July 4 to 32,300 on July 18, according to data compiled by John Hopkins University. However, as I said yesterday, it is important to understand that the rising infections are broadly concentrated in areas with higher vaccine hesitancy. According to data from the CDC, 97% of people who have died or been hospitalized with COVID-19 since the vaccine became widely available are unvaccinated. Dr Rochelle Walensky, Director of CDC said of the rising cases, “There is a clear message that is coming through. This is becoming a pandemic of the unvaccinated. Our biggest concern is we are going to continue to see preventable cases, hospitalizations, and sadly deaths among the unvaccinated.” Sadly, despite the widespread availability of the vaccine in the US, hesitancy in certain places remains very high.

In Japan, things are going from bad to worse with the Olympics. Despite reinstating a state of emergency and banning spectators from attending the events, the games have so far been beset by a slew of infections by both staffers and athletes. Today, the head Tokyo Olympics Committee did not rule out the potential for the games to still be cancelled last minute.

Like I said yesterday, it’s unclear how the situation will play out, but I continue to urge market participants not to panic just yet. While the rising cases are concerning and very unfortunate, on the positive side, the current vaccines have so far proven effective against the delta variant and countries around the world are quickly ramping up their vaccination efforts. But as always, one has to acknowledge the risks that are present in the market. 

Q2 earnings season is shaping up to another record-setting quarter, similar to Q1 of this year. So far, analysts are looking for S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 61.9% year-on-year in aggregate, according to FactSet data – an estimate UBS's Head of Equity Derivatives Research Stuart Kaiser said may still be ""need to be revised higher."" 

A big part of the strong Q2 earnings growth is easy comparisons to the year-earlier period that represented the bottom of the Covid-19 earnings impact. But Q2 estimates also reflect genuine growth, with total index earnings expected to be up +8.8% compared to the pre-Covid 2019 Q2 period. In other words, even when compared to an earnings season 2 years ago, well before the coronavirus pandemic, this earnings season is expected to show very strong growth. Estimates for Q2 and beyond have been steadily going up, with the current +60.5% earnings growth rate up from +50.6% at the end of March and +41.6% at the start of January 2021.

**Highlights**

* The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield continued its steady decline, 1.20% at the time of writing

stocks,"What does falling bond yields mean for a market correction? Hi there. I had a couple thought about bond yields, and was hoping someone could confirm/correct me on this thinking. 

1. Bond yields are falling, and have been steadily falling for years. Accelerated decline in yields demonstrates increased demand.

2. People with a brain of their own (as opposed to brain from financial press) know inflation is coming.

3. Bonds do poorly compared to stocks in inflationary periods because their payouts are locked for the buyer based on the price/yield when they buy.

4. Stocks tend to do better in inflationary periods because they maintain their purchase (selling) power.

Conclusion: Smart big money investors are fleeing to bonds to hedge against a market correction/collapse, that they expect to come before inflation really starts kicking us in the ass. With inflation coming quickly, the correction should be expected in the very short term.

stocks,"Market Commentary (Current Status of the Markets Right Now) - 7/20/2021  

Hello investors,

I wanted write a piece about the market conditions right now because recently, a few of the growth stocks that I have mentioned have been performing ""less than ideal"".

These include FVRR, UPST, W, PDD, TTD, FUTU, OZON, TIGR, etc.

These are great businesses with top line growth rates greater than 20% and so much potential to 5-10x in the next 5-10 years.

When I mentioned these names in my previous posts, the valuations were not cheap but they certainly were not ""stretched"". **They were at reasonable premia**, meaning the prices represented a reasonable amount of revenue growth rates, unlike Tesla stock price that was pricing 50% annual sales growth for the next 7 years, which is certainly not reasonable (even Google in their peak growth period grew at 30-40% annually for 4 consecutive years).

The key here is that these stocks were priced at reasonable premia, so as long as these companies achieve certain growth rates, they will be able to sustain those price levels.

The **only** thing that has changed since then is their **stock prices.**

Let's not forget that their businesses are still performing incredibly well. They still have the potential to 3-5x in the upcoming years.

\[large chunk of the memo deleted because it didn't follow the ""guidelines""\]

Right now, I only see the depressed valuation levels as better entry points.

Does that mean stocks will go up in the next month? Obviously not.

In fact, when you invest in businesses, you need to be ready for the stock to go down 50% and stay there for the next three years.

I mean who knows if the Delta variant will bring another liquidity crisis seen in March 2020, or if we'll see another solvency crisis seen in 2008.

My contention is that we won't likely see either. Despite the inflation readings and Fed's talking of tapering, investors are overestimating the hawkishness and the Fed will remain dovish for longer than many expect, providing a continued boost to the risk assets.

Great businesses, however, will shine at some point because the markets can no longer ignore their earnings power.

That's one of the main reasons why private equity outperforms most of the asset classes because there are no short-term price movements that investors or the management are concerned about. More often than not, equity owners in a public company see a decline in a stock price and they immediately call for revised business plan to cut costs and boost earnings, which can dampen the company's growth.

Main point I wanted to get across in today's post is always focus on the business's ability to generate cash flow and diversify your investments, despite what the markets are doing.

Thanks for reading as always and happy investing!"

\[deleted because it didn't follow the ""guidelines"" of the forum\]

As is true for most of the times in history, the chances are low.

\[deleted because it didn't follow the ""guidelines"" of the forum\]

Here's an interesting figure to illustrate my point.

📷

\[deleted because it didn't follow the ""guidelines"" of the forum\]

Again, these are just my opinions. You could very well may have different opinions and I respect that.

Back to the point, remember that the markets follow the earnings growth. If FVRR proves to produce sufficient earnings, the markets will inevitably recognize that and adjust the prices accordingly.

What that means for us is that at current levels of trading multiples, they've gotten cheaper than a few months ago.

Many people ask ""why are the growth stocks going down?"" ""Why are your stocks performing worse?"" ""Should I sell?""

As an investor/trader, you will most likely receive lots of these questions throughout your life and you get used to them at some point.

To them, I answer ""the stock market is only a distraction to your business investments"", a quote I borrowed from some wise investor whose name I've forgotten since.

If you can invest in a great business at a reasonable price, that's all that matters. If you can invest in them at lower prices, even better.

Right now, I only see the depressed valuation levels as better entry points.

Does that mean stocks will go up in the next month? Obviously not.

In fact, when you invest in businesses, you need to be ready for the stock to go down 50% and stay there for the next three years.

Yesterday's thread deserves the logical follow up.  Well, media said Delta caused the market to drop yesterday.    Ok, well, the markets are up nicely today.   How come no financial media outlet is saying Delta is now cured, since the market is just as green today as it was red yesterday?  Because that would be ludicrous to say.  As someone else said, maybe the markets dropped because of the Jamie Spears conservatorship developments.

If it really was Delta that caused the market to drop, the market would drop again today, because Delta is not cured in one day.

Yes, news absolutely moves markets.  But, I will reiterate to ignore all hindsight fluff news that tries to explain events after the fact.  Today, the market is up because there are more buyers than sellers. Not because Delta variant is now cured, which is supposedly why the market dropped yesterday."

The only thing preventing FDA approval for their latest drug Rolontis was a site inspection that was delayed because of travel restrictions to the Hanmi factory in Korea. Inspection took place 1/6, and so approval should be due any day now. Rolontis is for the treatment of neutropenia in Chemo patients. Currently they like all other drugs were aiming for it to be given the day after Chemo.  However an update now says they believe it is good to give to people 30 minutes after people have had Chemo, which would be more convenient for patients and hospitals alike, saving time and a lot of money. It would allow them to dominate the market, being able to be given just 30 minutes after Chemo treatment. 

In addition they have a second drug designated on the FDA fast track 11/3, so in theory that should be due approval 11/9 or thereabouts, for the treatment of small cell lung cancer, which has reported good results to date.

If anyone has any feature recommendations, comments, or concerns post here!

Some nifty things this app does:

* View most popular stocks on Reddit
* View mention frequency over time (24hrs - 30days)
* View related posts for tickers on Reddit
* The app automatically filters out mentions created by bots
* Search stock tickers to see the sentiment on reddit
* Notifies when there is a new top stock and when mentions increase or decrease by a certain threshold

This is very important because it even kind of happened to me on Monday. On Thursday my last entry on NYCB was 11.10. I was trading this a few times from 11.10-11.40.... just this friday.... Monday morning it opened under 11... I felt hey my last sale was 11.30... let me just comfortably set a bid to buy at 11..... it fell to 10.78... I didnt check the level 2's or the charts that also will would have shown selling pressure, instead I used the fact that I was trading it Thursday and sold at 11.30! In my defense, it isnt much of a defense, but I work full time and I trade on my phone. I do not recommend it, however we do the best we can with what we have.

Each day is different, even several hours is different. Interest rates, earnings reports can change things. Also, in general from 12-2PM eastern time is a slow down time. Alot of big banks and firms which account for 80% of trading go out for lunch and stocks that are supported by them may come off a little and you can get a deal! However, the biggest movement is still... 9:30AM-9:45AM and 3:45PM-4PM......

If you made a trade at 10AM... then you can safely make it probably to 12 by copying the same order but after that it is very important to see if there is still the same support via Level 2's, or by graphics the chart.... Trading is in my blood now, it courses thru my veins so without looking at a chart I can actually draw it with candle sticks, RSI, DMI curves based on movement and volume.... however I can not tell Level 2s. So the most important thing for day trading is level 2s!!! Level 2 is 90% and chart is 10%... Over time you will already know what the chart will look like by the stock movement. Yes, it will take time but thats 2nd nature.

The past few days we have tried to enter the same orders on NLS and LAKE... I am trading on phones but I can tell you when the volume builds on NLS, the Level 2s show tremendous buying support in order to drive this from 6.30 to 6.90. It had to have 2-5x more buyers than sellers.....

So in short do not assume that a price/order that was entered yesterday should work for today. Even a trade in the AM may not work in the PM.

If you are doing swing trading, this may make sense..... if you are long term, try not to watch intraday quotes it will drive you crazy!!!"
stocks,"Tesla Semi electric truck is finally about to go into production After years of delays, Tesla is finally about to start production of Tesla Semi, its all-electric semi-truck.

The whole truck industry is watching.

While there are already a few electric trucks on the road, none of them have the specs enabling longer range hauling in a class 8 semi-truck, like the Tesla Semi is promising.

When launching Tesla Semi in 2017, the automaker said that the electric truck’s production versions, a class 8 truck with an 80,000-lb capacity, will have 300-mile and 500-mile range options for $150,000 and $180,000, respectively.

It would also have the lowest cost of operation of any semi-truck, making it extremely disruptive in an industry where every cent counts.

However, the electric vehicle has seen many delays that cost it its momentum.

When unveiled in 2017, Tesla said that it would come to market in 2019, and it started taking reservations from many companies looking to electrify their fleets.

Tesla couldn’t deliver the truck in 2019. So it was delayed in 2020, which became 2021, but now things are really starting to move.

Every event does not have the capability to influence the market. Who exactly said these events are equal in scale to a multinational shutdown? Are we really surprised the condo collapse in Miami didnt effect the market? 

\&gt; Delta variant has been in the news for months, and NOW the market goes down because of Delta? Maybe yesterday the market went up because of Delta. Just as stupid.

again, the argument that its been in the news before therefore it can't effect the stock market. Why ""NOW""? *48 states are now seeing new case numbers rise at least 10% higher than the previous week.  Coronavirus-related hospitalizations have gone up, rising 35.8% between July 7 and July 13 compared with the previous week.* These things effected share prices just last year. 

Keep in mind these news agencies have contacts and sources that work on Wall Street. I would be willing to bet they asked them about this drop (in fact, some articles quote them). Also, the stocks that went up today are the ones whose model works well with a shutdown like Etsy and Pelton, both had a good day. Just like they did during early pandemic days. And shares for companies that benefit the most from an open economy did poorly. The articles say this btw. They also mention other potential factors like inflation. 

\&gt; Ignore all news. The market dropped because there were more sellers than buyers. The scapegoat just happens to be some arbitrary event. 

Theres typically a reason/reasons for these large movements. Perhaps the market overreacted but legitimate fears of more lock downs isnt some ""arbitrary event"" thats just happening in the background and disconnected from the worlds economy. The Miami condo example they provided is an ""arbitrary event"". The comparison of these things is baffling. And i dont even know what to think or say about the scapegoat part. But the message is clear; ""ignore all news"" based on these poorly thought out points."
stocks,"Why do people panic during market sell-offs? I see lots of very negative comments on daily threads across stocks/wsb. When the markets are red, the negative/sad people crawl from their caves and project even bigger drops and crashes.

Markets and economies tend to bounce back sooner or later. If they don’t - money will probably be the least of your problems. So unless you are near retirement or need that money ASAP - why would you worry? It should eventually come back up.

I understand feeling down when YOUR stock is down but the market is up (damn you, pltr). However, when the whole market is down and so is your portfolio - if anything, that presents a buying opportunity."
stocks,Is there a website to view historical PS and PE ratios for free? Many of the websites like TradingView or YCharts cost money if you want to look further than a 5 year time horizon so I was wondering if there were any free platforms available that show a larger amount of time (10+ years). Thanks for any help!
stocks,"What is a solutions company? Why do they make so much money? Should I invest in them? I see companies like this a lot they have growing revenue and will continuously operate at a profit. Even the companies who aren't built around them will offer ""solutions, but what in the hell do companies like these do? What are solutions exactly and why or why not may they be something I want to invest in? Sorry if this sounds stupid."
stocks,"Is shorting and longing the same stock a commong strategy for my unique situation?  First of all, I'm convinced that this stock is over-valued by far. It's heavily shorted, that if I were to panic-close my position and buy out all the shares, I'd never be able to short it again. 

So now, I'm thinking of buying the shares, but not closing out my position. I'm thinking of buying the shares in case it goes up a few more dollars, until they go back down. 

Is this strategy common?"
stocks,"What stocks go up or fall less when the market sells off / corrects? I've noticed that in general sell offs of course stocks that have more value oriented pes tend to usually not sell off as much.

I realize there are inverse etfs, but I'd rather not consider those in this discussion.

I would think in general stocks like PG, JNJ, etc would fall less.

Also could the beta of a stock be considered in determining stocks that generally are considered more defensive?

So in general is it value stocks that are more or less defensive in market corrections?  I would think most have a beta of less than 1?

Thanks."
stocks,"The bully type. These people don't really care what the cause is, as long as they can hide their cruelty behind the phony self-righteousness of the majority. They were rampant prior to the 2008 Global Financial Crisis. People who talked about a collapse in subprime, or worse still, a total financial collapse, were mocked and laughed out of the room. People who dared question whether insane profits off of mortgage bonds were sustainable were told, frankly, to shut the f\*\*\* up.

I was reading a book recently that takes place post-Spanish Civil War. The bullies came out on the side of the fascists to beat up the ""f\*gs"", the commies, and the degenerates, all in the name of upholding the good social order.

They're the ultimate cowards, because as soon as the tide turns against them, you'll find them go into hiding until they can find some other supposedly righteous cause to use to express their hatred.

I'm not saying the market is going to collapse, nobody knows if that will happen or when, but the bullies love to come out and play in an environment when things appear to be going well. Dissent is mocked and belittled, because hey, look at the profits. Look at the charts. If it's going up, you must be a dumbass to think otherwise.

Dissent is healthy. If you think bears are stupid, then ignore them, or refute them. Anyone who believes that dissent is silly, the Catholic Church could have used you in the Middle Ages.

For those of you who have a bull case and aren't bullies, then more power to you: happy investing, and if you feel so inclined, go ahead and share your thoughts! I love hearing evidence-based discussions and differing perspectives. That's how we all learn and grow as individuals and a society.

But innocent people of Reddit: don't take financial advice from the bullies. Don't take any advice from the bullies. It really is a sad class of human being.

I will probably be mocked for this or whatever, but that's OK, people who are truly open-minded will surely find value in what I'm sharing. All the best and happy investing!"
stocks,"2 years into trading, I feel a bit of elitism flowing in me that makes me think I'm better than non investors. I started trading before COVID, and since the pandemic, I've been strictly confined to working at home. I'll do a bit of work first and then spend the rest of my day absorbing/learning about the stock market. The more I learn about the market and the fundamentals of macro/micro economics, I realize financial freedom is extremely obtainable; the knowledge is just hard to acquire and difficult to navigate through. If more people were exposed to retail trading as the norm, we would have a lot more financially free don't you think?  It amazes me how many people still don't know about investing.

Like today I got a haircut (first time in a year) and I got to thinking, ""these guys get paid pennies, why can't they just put in 10k and go long on a blue chip stock? They'll make more money than a savings for sure. Then all they can do is sell CC's monthly for a nice stipend"" --subconsciously I thought that, coming from a higher position of power and it made me feel a bit elitist. I feel like investing is such a great opportunity to financial freedom that it's almost a shame not everybody does it. Anyone else feel the same? I'm so absorbed in my own world that, I'm not sure how uncommon it is for people not to invest?"

stocks,"When the market gets very tough/choppy and turns red, sometimes our best strategy for trading is to go with what I called super defensive. The last couple of days have been very tough. The Nasdaq down nearly 200 each day 1.5%. Honestly, it is surprising because for the most part earnings have been very good. GS, JPM, BAC, PACW, AN alot of companies coming with amazing numbers..... VOXX blew out top and bottom and was crushed!

Unfortunately, if you thought Friday was a dip… wow today! It is just very hard to time it, like the most of us...(we cant time it perfect), you found yourself buying the dip all day long! Yesterday for instance, I bought TIGR at 18.50 at first dip, thinking this was a steal it was just nearly 21.... then at 17.25... I told the elite group this is ridiculous I am going in..... I also mentioned today with examples why if I went completely defensive every single trade would have been green, but instead I was faked out by new highs on the market indexes.

So what we should do is buy what I call super defensive stocks which pay dividends anywhere between 8-10%. The reason being is when money flows from tech that alot of money will seek a safe haven. There is nothing more safer then a company that pays in cash 8-10% a year of the initial cost of shares. Unfortunately, as the stock price rises the yield comes down, which means if everyone follows this strategy we all cant win....unfortunately, the truth is on almost every trade there is a winner and a loser.... When you sell a stock you are doing so because you believe it is a higher and you can buy it again cheaper, or at a later date. When you buy a stock you are thinking you are getting an opportunity of a lifetime.

The reason we dont follow this principle always is because those stocks are not volatile and you are not able to make a lot on these trades. PSEC moves 20 cents a week.... TIGR moves 20-25% a day sometimes. Timed right TIGR is both a gift and a curse....

If things get bad. We must change strategy."
stocks,"98% of the articles on Marketwatch are 100% trash Pretty much every article you’ll read is just one guy’s thoughts about what may or may not happen with an individual stock or the market as a whole.

stocks,"Best way to start a career managing a portfolio? I’m 30 years old and am a self taught software developer. About 6 years ago I started to dabble in the stock market, mostly following companies, not really actively trading, etc.. Over the past 15 months or so I started building software to help me manage my 401k along with some of a friends money. It has been going well, I’m obviously not the best and everyone makes money in a bull market, yadda yadda. Aside from the moderate success I’ve had (beating S&amp;P over the last 13 months), because I know it’s too small of a sample and hasn’t survived a downturn, I think I can pass the Series 65 exam. 

Does anyone here have a career managing portfolios or being an investment advisor that didn’t get a degree in finance? I don’t have any college education, and I’m not really at a point where getting a 4 year degree is in the cards for me. However, I really enjoy working on this software and would love to make working with stocks/trading a full time job. Is passing the series 65 and some proof of a track record (even if I have to wait another year or two) enough to get a job or is the lack of a degree a non starter?"

And then spend the first 15min after market opening just watching the stock. Then use a candle stick chart to buy the stock at its opening price (top of the candle) and then put a stop loss order at the price at the bottom of the candle. Then at some point throughout the day, sell (at a higher price than what you paid for it). The difference is the profit you take home from a day of trading stocks. Is that about it? Does that explain what day trading is?"

My father was saying that I could save myself some taxes by selling now and taking a loss. I don't understand how that's the case. If I (using fake numbers) made $10k in day trading and am now $3k underwater in longer investments, can I take a loss and avoid enough taxes to break even or better on the loss?

I really don't even understand how that would work. Why would taking a loss of 3k make not paying 1k in taxes the better option? Or am I going about this in the wrong way?"

[See full prospectus here, ](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1783879/000162828021013318/robinhoods-1.htm)which includes one key point that the founders of Robinhood Baiju Bhatt and Vladimir Tenev have special Class B shares that give them 10 times voting power. The shares you buy are voteless Class C shares which can be upgraded to normal one-vote Class A shares on a case by case basis. In other words, Robinhood tells all the corporate raiders to bug off.

The growth of the company has been huge. Revenue [growing by 309%](https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/how-robinhoods-explosive-growth-rate-came-to-be/#:~:text=The%20fintech%20unicorn's%20revenue%20grew,a%20gain%20of%20around%20309%25.) between 2019 and July 1st. The amount of hate mail they get, poor reviews, SEC fines, growing competition from other low-commission brokers, and at least one guy indiscriminately assaulting Robinhood employees this past year has not stopped new accounts from coming in. From 7.2 million in March 2020 to 18 million [as of July 1st.](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/01/robinhood-has-18-million-accounts-managing-80-billion-after-rapid-one-year-growth-ipo-filing-shows.html) This growth has occurred despite many veteran users leaving the platform.

The reason for these trends can be found by how the average Robinhood user is:

1. 31 years old.

2. Has an account size of $4,500 (compared to E-Trade's $100,000).

3. Is a buy-and-hold investor (only 2% of accounts are flagged PDT).

4. Has 2 positions.

5. Did not have any investment account before Robinhood.

You see how Robinhood has become the Walmart of Stock Brokers, making money off economies of scale and the least common denominator. Robinhood's easy to use platform should continue to be millions of young people's first introduction to stocks for many decades.

Another point is Robinhood is now offering early IPO access. This is where they, as an institutional investor, buy large blocks of IPO starter shares and immediately resell them for a little more to their clients. The benefit of this is normally small orders don't have a chance of getting filled during an IPO.

One oddity from this is that Robinhood is, AS OF THIS MOMENT, offering their own shares on the app. The funny thing is, the many Robinhood users here can be sure your buy order will be filled during the IPO because their broker is making a huge amount of money selling you shares and if nothing else they can create more shares in order to sell them to you. I don't know for a fact they are planning to do that, though.

Robinhood is making roughly $2.2 billion a year as of right now and is seeking a valuation of $35 billion. Making for a starting PE Ratio of about 16. I give it a long term buy recommendation... Even though I no longer use Robinhood."

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Monday, July 19, 2021 **PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, July 19, 2021**

The market sank today, with all three major indexes falling, the largest overall drop in at least two months. The market gapped down after the remarkable rally in mega-cap technology stocks, which had been driving the market higher, paused. It seems the market is being pressured by concerns surrounding inflation and rising concerns of a resurgence of coronavirus infections among the unvaccinated caused by the highly contagious delta variant. Q2 earnings season rolls on, with more big banks and industry-leaders like Johnson and Johnson (JNJ) and Netflix (NFLX) reporting this week. So far, earnings have been encouraging but have so far not impressed Wall Street. 

Since the release of the June Consumer and Producer Price Indexes (CPI &amp; PPI), which showed price inflation growing at a higher than expected clip, the market has become increasingly volatile, not unlike what happened in mid-May, where the SPY lost roughly 4% in two or three days. The CPI, which measures changes in the prices of consumer goods, rose 0.9% in June, accelerating from May’s 0.6%. Year-on-year, the CPI is up 5.4%, exceeding the 4.9% expected by economists and the fastest rate of growth since 2008. Core CPI, which excludes the volatile price energy and food and is therefore considered a more accurate representation of general price inflation, was up 4.5% year-on-year as prices bounced from last year’s pandemic-era lows. PPI, which measures the average changes in prices received by domestic producers for their output rose 1% in June, accelerating to a 7.3% rise year-on-year, while still reflecting base effects. Core PPI rose 5.5%. This is the fastest rate of increase since 2009. 

Concerns about the coronavirus delta variant are rising across the globe. Recently, Japan reinstated a state of emergency and banned all spectators from attending the Olympics, which are kicking off soon. In the US, despite roughly 50% of the population being vaccinated, in the past two weeks, infections across the country have roughly doubled, with cases jumping from 13,200 on July 4 to 32,300 on July 18, according to data compiled by John Hopkins University. In response, LA country reinstated its mask mandate, with other places in the US expected to follow suit. However, it is important to note that infections in the US are concentrated in areas with higher vaccine hesitancy. According to data from the CDC, 97% of people who have died or been hospitalized with COVID-19 since the vaccine became widely available are unvaccinated. Dr Rochelle Walensky, Director of CDC said of the rising cases, “There is a clear message that is coming through. This is becoming a pandemic of the unvaccinated. Our biggest concern is we are going to continue to see preventable cases, hospitalizations, and sadly deaths among the unvaccinated.”

It’s unclear how the situation will play out, I urge market participants not to panic just yet. While the rising cases are concerning and very unfortunate, on the positive side, the current vaccines have so far proven effective against the delta variant and countries around the world are quickly ramping up their vaccination efforts. But as always, one has to acknowledge the risks that are present in the market. 

Last week, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell gave his semi-annual monetary policy testimony before Congress, where he largely reiterated the same thing he has been saying for months. Powell said “inflation will likely remain elevated in the coming months before moderating” and that the US economy was “still a ways” off from reaching the threshold of “substantial further progress” that would trigger the Central Bank to roll-back pandemic-era policies. In short, Powell basically said while he expects higher inflation prints in the coming months, pressures are transitory and due to pandemic era disruptions and the Fed’s goal for economic recovery have not been met. [Here is Powell’s complete testimony, but here are two of his most important quotes.](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/testimony/powell20210714a.htm)

**On the labor market:** “Conditions in the labor market have continued to improve, but there is still a long way to go. Labor demand appears to be very strong; job openings are at a record high, hiring is robust, and many workers are leaving their current jobs to search for better ones. Indeed, employers added 1.7 million workers from April through June. However, the unemployment rate remained elevated in June at 5.9 percent, and this figure understates the shortfall in employment, particularly as participation in the labor market has not moved up from the low rates that have prevailed for most of the past year. Job gains should be strong in coming months as public health conditions continue to improve and as some of the other pandemic-related factors currently weighing them down diminish.”

**On inflation:** “Inflation has increased notably and will likely remain elevated in coming months before moderating. Inflation is being temporarily boosted by base effects, as the sharp pandemic-related price declines from last spring drop out of the 12-month calculation. In addition, strong demand in sectors where production bottlenecks or other supply constraints have limited production has led to especially rapid price increases for some goods and services, which should partially reverse as the effects of the bottlenecks unwind. Prices for services that were hard hit by the pandemic have also jumped in recent months as demand for these services has surged with the reopening of the economy”.

In other news, Q2 earnings season rolls on. As of today, roughly 8% of companies in the SPY have reported, with 85% of those beating expectations, according to FactSet. It seems like this quarter is shaping up to be another record-breaking season, with corporate earnings super-charged by rising demand from savings-laden consumers.

stocks,"New Screening Tool From TIKR -- Worth The Look Hey guys -- 

I'm sure some of you have already heard (or use) [TIKR.com](https://TIKR.com). They recently launched their global equity screening tool and it is fantastic. 

One of my favorite things about the screener is that it scans every global market, which is something you don't find in a lot of online screeners. 

What is everyone's favorite screen to run? One of my favorites is looking for high growth stocks that are trading at a reasonable valuation (GARP). 

I like businesses that have grown revenues at a 5%+ CAGR, FCF at a 10% CAGR, and trade at less than 30x NTM P/E. 

Currently that screen yields 690 results in TIKR.

stocks,"A bear market hypothesis from a bull, COVID 4th wave is here I have been investing for the better part of 10 years now and into swing trading for the last 3 years. I have been a bull almost my entire time investing, with the exception of a few of the black swan events we have had.  I feel that I have a pretty high risk tolerance and typically do not even hedge my long positions. However, my hypothesis is that we will soon see a steep stock market correction. To be fair my hypothesis is pretty narrow and does not account for the countless factors that drive the market. My hypothesis is that we are early in the 4th wave of COVID.  I am a physician assistant and I work in an urgent care and two ERs in Louisiana.  I can tell you that all of my colleagues and I have been seeing a marked increase in COVID cases in the last 3-4 weeks. Even more so last week.  I can tell you hospitals in my are near capacity and almost all are on hospital wide diversion (meaning they aren't accepting noncritical transfers). Looking at the national and Louisiana new case rate you can see small uptrend in cases in the last few weeks, but keep in mind this data is delayed. It does not account for the most recently cases ( I believe it is delayed by a week or two). I believe that this is the beginning of the 4th wave and soon we will see numbers like we did back in November-February.  Counter point obviously is vaccination. Unfortunately, Louisiana does have some of the lowest vaccination rates in the country, at around 39%. Nationally the vaccination rate is around 48% fully vaccinated. I spend so much of my time trying to educate, but it seems that most of the people that wanted to get vaccinated already have. I don't see a drastic uptick in vaccination rates especially in southern states where conspiracy theories run rampant.  I ask every single patient that I diagnose with covid if they have been vaccinated and I can tell you about 8-10% of my patients are vaccinated. The vaccine obviously provides protection, but I fear that at under 50% is not high enough. Additionally, covid fatigue is a real thing. I know most people are tired of hearing about it. Our guard is down. I am not sure how it is in the rest of the country but, in my state everything is pretty much 100% open and back to normal. No one wears masks in public anymore and I do not see that changing unless a masks again become required to enter businesses (as of now they are not my area).  People are back to gathering in large groups.  I believe this is the prefect situation for us to see a rapid increase in new case rates leading to the 4th wave. Now here is where it gets more complex. Once we are in the fully into our 4th spike what will happen? Do we have massive lockdowns again, restaurants, bars, schools etc closed. If so I think so we will see another big dip in the market. Or do they simply recommended masks use in public places. If this happens I'd imagine we still have  a dip from covid case spiking fears, but not as much as if we are locked down again.  I do realize my hypothesis uses a lot of information from my first hand accounts and may seem to others to be short sighted. That is why I would like to hear form you and see your feelings on the upcoming 3,6,12 months.  As for me, I am bearish at least in the short term. 

&amp;#x200B;

Disclosure: I hold only long positions at this time. I am not short any individual stocks, options, or indexes at this time, but am considering going some short SPY positions soon.

TLDR: I work in healthcare and in my opinion we are in the early part of the COVID 4th wave. Question is how will the market react.

Transaction to combine Upjohn with Mylan to form Viatris in the fourth quarter 2020 completed. PFE now operates as a single focused innovative biopharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery, development, manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution of biopharmaceutical products worldwide.
 
The emergence of new coronavirus variants, including the highly transmissible delta variant, could fuel increased and sustained demand for BNT162b2, Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine.

8% to 12% annual sales growth expected between 2021 and 2025 as new drugs offset generic competition.

PFE has 99 experimental drugs in clinical development, including 22 late-stage programs. 

Bought back nearly $9 billion of its own shares in 2019.

No share repurchases were made in 2020 and no shares have been repurchased through February 2021. As of February 2, 2021, Pfizer’s remaining share repurchase authorization is $5.3 billion. Current 2021 financial guidance does not reflect any share repurchases in 2021.

In 2020 Pfizer's sales popped 2% to $41.91 billion. That excluded the Upjohn unit, which Pfizer merged with Mylan to create Viatris (VTRS). The Upjohn business housed Pfizer's older drugs, including those facing generic competition. Negligible BNT162b2 sales in 2020. Decision to divest its off-patent division should result in faster growth. 

Strong cash flows generated from a basket of diverse drugs.
 
Large size confers significant competitive advantages in developing new drugs as well as economies of scale, strong R&amp;D capabilities.

Pfizer is now launching several potential blockbusters in cancer, heart disease, and immunology. cardiovascular drug Vyndaqel is a potential game-changer in the rare disease area.


Threats-

Facing pressure since President Joe Biden and U.S. Trade Representative Ambassador Katherine Tai voiced support for waiving the patent rights protecting Covid vaccines.

Concerns have also emerged that the Covid vaccines using messenger RNA technology could be tied to heart inflammation in people younger than age 30. Studies conducted on vaccines from Johnson &amp; Johnson and AstraZeneca show no link between these vaccines and similar heart conditions.

In January Pfizer stock tumbled close to 3% on a single day after the company said rheumatoid arthritis drug Xeljanz failed to outperform a rival medicine in a post-marketing study.

Covid-19 vaccines work too well.

Pharma legislation, competition, lawsuits - all the usual suspects.


Covid-19 -

PFE's COVID-19 vaccine, BNT162b2, uses messenger RNA technology or mRNA, which tells the body to make a single spike protein, mimicking the outside of the virus.

Has increased its guidance for BNT162b2 revenue to $26 billion from $15 billion and lifted its EPS guidance on May 4, 2021. 

Both Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech are negotiating new contracts and remain best positioned to develop the first vaccines against new variants. Moderna has released the first data for a third dose with its mRNA-1273.351 variant vaccine that imply stronger and more consistent protection across variants and Pfizer expects data from its own variant vaccine in July. Pfizer also noted that future variant vaccine updates may only need a lead time until regulatory authorization of roughly 100 days.

Pfizer is scaling up manufacturing to meet its commitment to deliver billion doses of its coronavirus vaccine by the end of 2021.

Expect COVID-19 vaccine sales will create very strong growth in 2021, but likely weigh on growth by 2023 as competitive vaccines erode pricing and demand for Pfizer's vaccine. 

Expect improved bottom line on increased annual revenue over the next three years as cost-cutting plans and share buybacks (currently paused) take shape.

BNT162b2 was granted an emergency use authorization (EUA) in the U.S. in December 2020.

Instead of mRNA, China’s leading vaccine makers, state-owned Sinopharm and private firm Sinovac, rely on inactivated vaccine technology and their effectiveness is poor especially against the Delta variant.  CCP sponsored unfounded concerns and negative reviews around mRNA. CCP vaccine diplomacy failing miserably as Chinese non-mRNA vaccines are maybe 50% effective.   

Variants of concern — 
Alpha - Britian - ~ twice as contagious as the original
Beta - South Africa
Gamma - Brazil
Delta - India - about 60 percent more contagious than Alpha

The FDA has said Pfizer can transport and store their BNT162b2 at more standard freezer temperatures.

Testing out a booster to the original vaccine. From a PFE financial perspective, they would benefit if booster doses are needed.

Effectiveness against Delta variant, the most contagious variant, seen at 64% in Isreal and about 71% almost everywhere else.

FDA 

Submitted applications for full approval vaccine (Biologic License Application) to the FDA on May 7, 2021.
Full approval expected within 6 months typically, so latest expected approval 11/7/2021, unsure now; FDA (7/15/2021) set January 2022 target to decide on approval of Pfizer's COVID-19 shot for those at leat 16 years old although noted highest priority and earlier possible.
Full approval allows their Covid vaccine to stay on the market after the pandemic ends and PFE could also market directly to consumers and change the vaccine's price.

On May 10, the FDA authorized the companies' Covid vaccine for emergency use in teens ages 12-15. European officials followed on May 28.

In September, Pfizer expects to have the test results of its Covid vaccine in children ages 2-5 and 5-11. It will then ask for emergency authorization for those groups. In November, the company expects to have data from tests in children age 6 months to 2 years.

The possible need for booster shots could further extend vaccine sales.

Per FDA, emergency authorization for Covid-19 vaccines in children under 12 could come in early to midwinter. The agency hopes to then move quickly to full approval of the vaccine for this age group.

7/13/2021
Meets with top U.S. health officials yesterday to discuss the authorization of a third dose of its COVID-19 vaccine. Biden’s chief medical adviser acknowledged that ""it is entirely conceivable, maybe likely” that booster shots will be needed.  Health officials need to see more data to know if additional shots could raise people's risk of serious side effect. The second dose for two-shot COVID-19 vaccine regimens was associated with higher rates of side effects.

PFE's booster study suggests people’s antibody levels jump five- to 10-fold after a third dose, compared to their second dose months earlier.

Currently only about 48% of the U.S. population is fully vaccinated.

7/12/2021
RBC Capital  increased the target price from $43 to $44 and reiterated a Hold rating.

In early July PFE disclosed it's developing a specific vaccine to tackle the Delta variant.  Hopes to start testing in August.

PFE is also testing a third dose of its vaccine as a booster shot.

In the Europen Union 77 million doses of Pfizer’s Comirnaty and 20 million doses of Moderna’s Spikevax vaccine had been administered as of May 31. 

Israel became the first country to offer boosters, authorising third doses of the BioNTech/Pfizer shot to adults with serious pre-existing medical conditions. Other countries are considering whether and when to follow suit.

Some expect that booster Covid shots will be necessary in the years to come as the virus continues to circulate, much like with influenza, for which annual revaccination is required.

Researchers are increasingly encouraged by breath tests that can detect Covid-19.

The Food and Drug Administration is adding a warning label to the Johnson &amp; Johnson Covid-19 vaccine following reports of 100 cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome in vaccine recipients. Ninety-five of those cases were serious enough to require hospitalization and one person died.

Graphene oxide is not among the ingredients found in Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine, despite alarmist claims to the contrary on social media from Spain.

7/8/2021
Pfizer said that it planned to ask the FDA for emergency approval for a third dose of its vaccine and that it was working on a shot that offered more protection against the Delta variant. PFE noted that vaccine efficacy MAY decline six months after immunization. Scientists were critical of the announcement, pointing to evidence that the current two-dose regimen is powerfully effective against the coronavirus. 
FDA and CDC responded that fully vaccinated people generally did not need boosters — yet.

7/7/2021
From May 15 to July 12, of the 29,380 COVID-19 cases reported in Ontario, 83.2 per cent had not been vaccinated at all and 15.6 per cent were partially vaccinated. About 1.2 per cent were fully vaccinated. 

United Kingdom is suffering another major coronavirus outbreak. There appear to be both outbreaks in clusters of people who are not vaccinated yet and also a significant number of breakthrough infections that got past the vaccine — though importantly, vaccination still seems to prevent almost all serious illness. The U.K. has mostly used the AstraZeneca vaccine, which is not as good as the Pfizer and Moderna versions used for most American inoculations.


7/6/2021
Brazil approved a new clinical trial of a COVID-19 vaccine candidate to be developed and tested by Sanofi Pasteur, the vaccination division of French pharmaceutical giant Sanofi. The phase 1/2 trial is also expected to take place in the United States, Honduras and Australia.

New Zealand has approved use of the Johnson &amp; Johnson coronavirus vaccine, after earlier in the year approving the Pfizer vaccine. But New Zealand is staying with its plan of primarily using the Pfizer vaccine to inoculate the population of 5 million.

7/5/2021
South Korea is in talks with mRNA vaccine makers including Pfizer and Moderna to produce shots in the country and is ready to offer the capacity to make up to 1 billion doses immediately, a senior government official said.

5/4/2021- 1st Quarter 2021 reported
1st Quarter 2021 revenues of $14.6 billion, up 42%.
Adjusted diluted EPS of $0.93, beating the consensus estimate by $0.15 and rising 47%. 
GAAP net income was $4.877 billion or $0.86 per diluted share, compared to $3.355 billion or $0.60 per share.

COVID-19 vaccine sales are providing a major lift to sales and earnings in 2021 and likely into 2022.

Total sales increased 42% (up 8% excluding COVID-19 vaccine sales)

COVID-19 vaccine sales contributed $3.5 billion in the quarter and are guided to be almost $26 billion in 2021, above previous guidance of $15 billion and ahead of our $23 billion estimate. 

Top drugs Eliquis (cardiovascular),Vyndaqel (rare disease) and Xeljanz (immunology) all posted strong gains based on leading efficacy driving market share gains. 

Cancer drug Ibrance fell 1% as economic hardships (likely related to the pandemic) are increasing the need for Pfizer assistance programs, but this should reverse as the pandemic eases.
 
Pneumococcal vaccine Prevnar fell 57% in U.S. adults, where guidance against co-administration with COVID-19 vaccines pressured results, but a new co-administration study of nextgeneration Prevnar 20 with the COVID-19 vaccine (data later in 2021) should help reinvigorate the franchise.

Excluding Revenues for BNT162b2 of $3.5 billion, revenues grew 8% operationally including a negative 5% impact from pricing.

Raised full-year 2021 guidance for revenues to a range of $70.5 to $72.5 billion and adjusted diluted EPS to a range of $3.55 to $3.65, primarily reflecting updates to anticipated contributions from BNT162b2 partially offset by additional R&amp;D expenses for vaccines to protect against COVID-19 as well as other mRNA-based development programs and COVID-19 antivirals.

Now anticipates revenues of approximately $26 billion for BNT162b2, reflecting 1.6 billion doses expected to be delivered in 2021 under signed contracts as of mid-April 2021.

Enters into contracts to supply BNT162b2 to Canada and Israel for periods beyond 2021; ngotiating similar potential contracts with other countries.

Maintains quarterly dividend for second-quarter 2021 at $0.39/share; dividend will not be reduced as a result of the initiation of a quarterly dividend by Viatris Inc. 

2/2/2021 - 4th Quarter 2020 and Full Year 2020

Quotes from the earnings release -

In the fourth quarter, achieved double digit operational revenue growth driven by a wide range of products and geographies, including growth within all of our therapeutic areas.

Guidance -
The midpoint of the guidance range for revenues represents 44% growth from 2020 revenues, including an expected $1.4 billion, or 3%, favorable impact from changes in foreign exchange rates. The midpoint of the updated guidance range for Adjusted diluted EPS reflects a 42% increase over 2020 actual results, including an expected $0.09, or 4%, benefit due to favorable changes in foreign exchange rates.

Financial guidance for Adjusted diluted EPS is calculated using approximately 5.7 billion weighted average shares outstanding, and does not currently assume any share repurchases in 2021.

Revenues for BNT162b2 approximately $15 billion, contributed $154 million in sales in the fourth quarter.

The BNT162b2 revenue projection incorporated within Pfizer’s 2021 financial guidance primarily includes doses
that are expected to be delivered in 2021 under existing contracts, and may be adjusted in the future as additional
contracts are executed.

Guidance for BNT162b2 incorporates the current expectation for revenues for the product, less anticipated Adjusted costs to manufacture, market and distribute BNT162b2, including applicable royalty expenses and a 50% gross margin split with BioNTech, as well as shared R&amp;D expenses related to BNT162b2 and costs associated with other assets currently in development for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.

Diluted weighted-average shares outstanding was 5,662 million shares, an increase of 31 million shares compared to the prior-year quarter primarily due to shares issued for employee compensation programs."
stocks,"Which stocks are on sale today?? Today is a red day. Some newbies would call it bloody.

Some stocks I think are in a good price range are

LYB. The materials company is down 10% in the last 5 days. From 104$ to 92$.

Airbus. The defense and aeronautical European giant was climbing slowly but firmly to regain their 139€ pre-pandemic and today they are down 6%. The stock is at  104

Fiserv. The financial and technological company was climbing since pandemic. It reached 127 three months ago. Bad results and not filling the expectations made the stock go down since then. Today is down 4% at  106$. And I had this company on my radar before pandemic with a 150$ goal in one year

stocks,"Why today's stock drop doesn't concern me. We had a giant drop last Feb/March due to rising COVID cases. We have a moderate one today, rising Delta variant cases.

But just like before, a vaccine will kill those cases. In this case, it's a booster shot. 

And so much of the developed world is already vaxxed anyway, which is pretty strongly protective against Delta. And the developed world is where most economic activity is.

In other words, if we didn't get financially slaughtered last time, there's even less reason why we should this time.

stocks,"Morning Update for Monday, 07/19/21 Good morning everyone! I hope you had a nice weekend.

*This list is geared towards day trading. With the momentum watchlist especially, I am typically in and out very quickly, only occasionally longer than a couple minutes, usually faster scalps.* Always have a plan when you enter a trade (for profit taking and for taking a loss), and use proper risk management for your account.

**Main Watchlist:**

Gapping UP:

* FIVN: Gapping up over relevant SMA's. Could find potential support around 188, I'll be watching price action around that level. If it holds up, it could see more upwards movement.
* FLOW: Looking to open at new ATH after this large gap up. Potential premarket support at around 77. I'll be watching for potential shorting opportunities, as I think it could get over-extended. 
* UVXY: Worth keeping an eye on this if we see more selling off. I suggest getting in and out, as it can be risky to hold over the course of multiple days. 

Gapping DOWN:

* TSLA: Currently gapping down below the SMA(200), looking to open around the SMA(50). Could see more downwards movement if it can't hold up over 627. 
* AAPL: Daily chart was looking extended, and now gapping down below SMA(9). Could retrace to SMA(20) if it continues to show weakness (\~139.57). 
* BA: Gapping down below SMA(200) after breaking down below it and 220 support on Friday. I'm taking this as a bearish indicator, but it could potentially find support around the 210 level. If it breaks down below 210 and cannot recover, I'll be looking for short opportunities. 
* UAL: 44 could serve as a key level. If it can get back above, I'll be looking for opportunities to go long. If it rejects that level, I'll be looking for shorting opportunities down towards 42, maybe even 40. 
* CCL: 20 could serve as a resistance level, with 19 and 18 as potential support levels. 
* BABA: Gapping down below relevant SMA's. 210 could serve as resistance level, I'll be watching for shorting opportunities and a retrace towards the 200 level. 
* NIO: Currently looking to open below relevant SMA's. I'll be watching price action around 41.25 (SMA(100)), could provide shorting opportunities if it continues to show weakness. 
* CPE: Gapping down below SMA(100) after testing that level in Friday's trading. I'll be watching for shorting opportunities back down towards the support level of 36 if it continues to show weakness. 
* MP: 32 could serve as a resistance level. Potential support levels at 30 and 28. 

**Market Outlook:**

Stocks are looking to open lower this morning, as earnings season is set to heat up this week. We've seen concerns about growth slowing, inflation, and COVID, and we are seeing some selling off this morning. Multiple indices are looking bearish (according to my own TA), so I'm going to proceed with caution today. It could be a good day for shorting opportunities. SPY is trading a bit over 426, and things are looking pretty bearish on the daily chart at the moment. We could see more downwards movement towards the SMA(50) (\~423). DIA is trading a little under 342, and gapped down below the significant support level around 345. Could find potential support at 340, or retrace to the SMA(100) at around 337.25. QQQ is trading just over 354, and could see more downwards movement, particularly if it can't get back up and hold over 355. Gold and silver are down at the moment, with crude oil sliding even further. Marijuana stocks continue their recent weakness and are down as well. Meme stocks are not immune to the weakness we are seeing this morning, and are down as well. 

Not much strength in the market this morning, and we could be in for more volatility and indecision. Stay disciplined in your trading and don't force trades. There will be opportunities, even on a day like this. Especially on a day like this. 

Remember to use proper risk management, by making sure you size appropriately for your account and have a plan for every trade you enter (both for taking profits and cutting losses). Happy trading everyone :)"

stocks,"The Risk Outlook of Investing in Alibaba (BABA) ADR Hi gang,  


Wondering if anyone can shed some ""professional"" light on the current and ongoing risks of investing in Alibaba (BABA) listed on the NYSE as American depositary shares (ADS/ADR). In addition, what happens if the ADR shares eventually did get delisted?  


Here are some thoughts or added questions to consider:  


\-It seems many people have begun the process of converting their US ADR shares to Hong Kong shares. For those left holding US ADR shares, are there any downfalls to this, or could it continue putting downward pressure on the US ADR shares? For non-Chinese investors, it seems like there are risks either way to holding US ADR or Hong Kong shares.

\-If the SEC / NYSE did move ahead with delisting of BABA ADR shares (as well as other companies), would an investor suddenly lose their investment or would the shares simply begin trading over-the-counter? Recent article quote "" If Chinese or other foreign ADRs are delisted, they could move to be traded only on US over-the-counter (OTC) markets rather than the NYSE or Nasdaq exchanges, or potentially barred from trading in the US entirely"".  I'm guessing the share price would likely be hammered regardless, but would the stock in my brokerage account simply switch ticker symbols for example?  


\-On the flip side, there are those who don't think BABA shares will get delisted in the end. A delisting would obviously have negative impacts for both China and US investors, and Alibaba has always seemed to be on the good side of the SEC. Recently, Charlie Munger also invested roughly $37 million into BABA ADR shares through the Daily Journal, and you would think they considered the delisting risk as minimal unless they were okay with potentially losing that much money. 

As full disclosure, I do own BABA ADR shares and would like to remain a long-term holder as I'm comfortable with some of the political risk involved. However, the prospect of losing my investment entirely is not so appealing. With all the delisting talk aside, I do believe Alibaba is undervalued for many reasons and remains a great long term investment.  


So is investing is BABA right now really as risky as going yolo Gamestop (GME), haha. I understand the political arguments, but do most people believe China would actually take such huge steps backwards by halting outside investments and / or the SEC hurting a large number of US investors and ETF funds holding BABA shares?  Definitely seems counterproductive and possibly overblown. Thoughts?"
stocks,"During these Red Times, here's some entry targets I'm looking for in the case of a bounce So I'm sitting 70% cash right now - so if we're not in for a correction then I will be kicking myself. With that said here's some targets I'm looking at for new entries, I have limit buys set on all tickers below:

PINS - &lt;$60: We've retraced to this level in May and seen a bounce, I love the company but I sold at $76 when we started to lose steam, high conviction for $100 on this ticker but it could be years away still, looking to take profit around the $75 region again.

SPCE ~$15: Meme stock I know, and I think people are starting to see how poor the revenue model actually is for this company, with that said I think the buy wall at $15 is massive and cannot be ignored, with the price bleeding towards that value for the second time in 3 months after breaking ATH, both before and after said $15 crash. I think this one may be a dumb money move.

CRSR ~$30: I love this stock already and own many Corsair products. I'd be going all in now if I had the balls but there is a steep cliff edge on this stock, next support may be far away if we can't hold above $29, will be watching this carefully and maybe stopping out below $28 as this is one of the only stocks in my portfolio currently

AMD - &lt;$75: Another favourite of mine, again sold around $81, similar principle to PINS but with the recent chip shortage (bullish long-term imo) and market losing steam I'd look for a cheaper price, it's relatively stable which is why the entry is still pretty high for what it is

NIO - &lt;$34: Not sure if we'll see this price again due to the unpredictability of China/EV Market/Memes but I see it running again if it hits around these levels - I actually avoided this stock in early May when I thought I saw a head and shoulders forming on the 1-month chart and still chastising myself for that one

Ships that have unfortunately sailed for me: NET, NVDA, TSLA, change my mind?

These are my thoughts for now, any circuit breakers like COVID-20 or WW3 would obviously make me change my tune but my 2 cents for now, let me know what you guys think!"
stocks,"If options volume/trading doubled every 5 years and less investment went into the purchase of stocks - what would happen? \*\*\* Qualifier - I have never bought options, so I understand their definitions and basic premise, that's it.

I've seen reference to options trading increases recently.   Is there any data on long term history of options use increasing/decreasing as compared to investment into stocks?  

If the market is leaning that way - is it temporary - or a trend that I should possibly consider including in part of my investment approach?"
stocks,"During market downturn, have you retreated your ETF? I understand the saying of time in the market, but if a big market downturn has come, say something huge like March 2020, would you sell out some of ETF? 

If yes, how many percentages downwards would you set as a selling point?"
stocks,"My first ever Call Option not going great. Looking for help on potential outcomes, anticipating a down market I use Robinhood and two weeks ago I bought a Call Option for Under Armor (UAA). Strike price of $21.50 for 8/6 at a premium of $1.13 a share. 

At the time the price was $21.40, and this time of year they release an earnings report and the stock typically gets a bump.

Right now UAA is trading at $19.26.

I live in Los Angeles and we’re already starting with the restricted Covid rules again, so I’m now anticipating the markets will potentially be down the next few weeks. I would therefore like to understand what my exit choices are.

I understand the concept of letting an OTM Option expire worthless and losing the $113, but is it possible to cut my losses right now, or is that considered selling a “naked call” in Robinhood?

When I go to the “sell” screen it shows an Ask of $0.43 for the Call. If I choose to sell does that mean I still retain $43? And if I “sell” early am I still required to provide the actual shares by expiry?

Since it’s only $43 I may still hold off until the week before. But wanted to understand the full dynamic if there’s a large dip looming.

Thanks for any help."

stocks,"Here are the major factors contributing to a very possible market correction soon I am not a market expert but I have been observing red flags piling up recently and it’s wise to pay close attention to them as they point to a near market correction including: 

**Low market breadth and divergence:** there are fewer stocks rising versus ones declining, and a larger number of stocks are hitting the 52 week low than the ones hitting the 52 week high. 

**Overbought stocks:** such as AAPL, AMZN, MSFT, NVDA, and ARKK all have recently breached the 70 RSI overbought marker and are now dropping fast. This ties in well with the poor market breadth as allot of the money existing other stocks as they sell off is just pilling in few top stocks in an unstained way, hence the overbought flag. 

**Reduced volumes:** signal weakness in the market and provoke profit taking. For example the Russell 2000 average volume has dropped to just under 3 billion per day from a three months average of 3.7 billion. Incidentally this index tracks 2,000 small cap US companies which have been dropping for most of the last 3 weeks for a total decline of 7.3% thus far. 

**Major trend line broken:** for the second time in less than one month the S&amp;P 500 has dipped under its major trend line. The first time on May 18th, it reversed and went back up on the back of decent labor and production reports plus earnings expectations. Now that earnings are underway and most economic indicators are pointing to growth peaking it might not be able to reverse the drop. 

Obviously all of the above are technical indicators that try to explain market behavior based on historical metrics, but they don’t explain the reasons behind such changes. We have to look at economic news to identify causes including: 

**Peaking economic recovery:** several reports this month point to an economy that has reached peak recovery. For example, both the services PMI 64.6 vs 65.2 vs 64.8 (actual, forecast, previous) and ISM 60.1% vs 63.3% vs 64.0% reports for June show a declining rate of expansion. Also, industrial production is showing similar pattern 0.4% vs 0.6% vs 0.7%.

**Mixed Q2 banking results:** also point to the same issue above. While the overall figures are up, the details point to absence of loan growth and net interest margin weakness. 

**Declining consumer sentiment:** while consumer spending came in higher than expected for the month of June consumer sentiment declined from 85.5 to 80.8. The main driver behind this is inflation.  

**Inflation rising:** the FED has been harping on inflation being transitory because of the “base effect” and some temporary supply constraints. Their timeline for all of that to sort out was few months. Now it’s more than few months and inflation continues to rage registering the highest figures in over a decade with Core CPI (the Fed’s favorite metric) registering 0.9%, the highest increase since 2008.

Furthermore, the PPI (producer price index) also continues to rise at a rate of 1% in June indicating that consumers are still going to see higher prices in the coming months and that overall inflation will overshoot the FED’s 2% threshold by a wide margin. 

**Reemergence of a new variant:**  the delta variant is causing allot of lock downs and interruption throughout the world. While its effect in the US might be limited, a slowing world economy does not bode well for stocks in general, hence perhaps the reason why bonds have gone up. 

**Bond yields going down:** usually indicates that an economy is slowing and investors are looking for safer assists. Many have pointed out that bond yields usually peak 3 months in advance of the stock which they did in March. Since we are in July and bond yield continue to decline many think the bond market is sniffing out something and reacting to it. Remember, the inverse relation between bonds and yields. 

**China’s Crack on tech:** has rattled some investors especially that it came at a time when that market was showing sign of bottoming out. 

All of those events point to a possible correction sometime in the near future. Most experts expect that sometime after Q2 earnings, but it could be starting as we speak, especially that corrections don’t play out in one straight line. They tend to move in a series of several lower lows and lower highs until bottoming out. 

It’s important to also point out that a correction is not a market crash. Corrections are a much smaller event, ranging around a -10% drop on the low end for the leading S&amp;P 500 index and much more for individual speculative stocks. They are a healthy event that helps reinvigorate the market with new buyers. 

A crash on the other hand is a much larger event that’s usually provoked by a combination of events or a single major event. Crashes usually last much longer than people expect, well past the initial large drop. 

There are several catalysts for such an event such as the emergence of a virus variant that outsmarts vaccines or a collapse in the reverse repo facility. The most prominent of them however, is QE tapering (quantitative easing) and increase in interest rates. 

Massive QE and low interest rates have been the driving force behind this bull market. They are the justification given for the current astronomical valuation where the S&amp;P500 Shiller P/E ratio is reaching a whopping 38%! That is a historic high only second to the Dotcom bubble in 2000 (44%) and is in general an unsustainable level in the long term. 

Some argue that the FED will manage to taper QE and increase interest rates gradually in a very controlled manner and avoid any meltdown, but given rising inflation beyond expectations, the FED might very well be forced to act much sooner than it would like. Equities and bonds expert Ray Dalio explains this process in his most recent video on YouTube."
stocks,"BP as a value/growth investment 
What are your thoughts on BP? Obviously there is investor uncertainty with the ethics of this company and things are looking rocky as they are trying to head towards renewable energy. If they succeed, surely they are there to profit from the inevitable shift to clean energy?
We’ve seen a rather large drop due to the pandemic but it hasn’t recovered like most of the stock market. 5% Dividend payouts are also quite attractive but I’m not sure how reliable they will be into the future. As far as I’m aware there hasn’t been too much share dilution either which might’ve explained the downfall. 

What is the general consensus?"

From here on I decided to pour money into dividend stocks instead, specifically I want to go for the aristocratic dividends.

I prepared myself by getting the simply Wall St app, and want to check their evaluation before buying. My plan is to buy up stocks from the aristocratic dividend list when they are deemed under evaluated.

stocks,"What resources are available to rehabilitate a serial stock basher such as myself? It started in January where I enjoyed antagonizing people on reddit who bought into GME at $300 thinking it would go up to $1,000. 

Soon after it my desire to bash spread to similar stocks, and I found myself always seeking a bigger rush and emotional response. 

Once I found Yahoo Finance stock conversations and saw the option to post gifs, I knew it would give me the rush I so greatly desired. 

Day after day I would go the biggest losers and trash on the stocks, just to enjoy seeing the reaction of others. 

After a while I acquired a taste for speculative and small cap stocks, as they are naturally more risky and it's easier to scare people. Focusing on the negatives and shaping worst case scenarios into something that seemed likely to occur, I took joy in scaring people. This is especially effective in speculative / small cap stocks, where investors are often left in the dark. 

However more recently, I've aimed my focus towards those that have obviously been victims of pump and dumps on garbage penny stocks. A gif of a garbage bag thrown out is just the thing to set these bag holders into a rage after they've already realized they bought into some garbage company at an all time high that will likely not be reached for years. 

Anyways, I've come to feel bad about my stock bashing ways. Not only is a waste of my time, as I'm an unpaid basher, but I fear the bad karma that may come my way.

stocks,"China Signals End to $2 Trillion U.S. Stock Listing Juggernaut For two decades Chinese tech firms have flocked to the U.S. stock market, drawn by a friendly regulatory environment and a vast pool of capital eager to invest in one of the world’s fastest-growing economies.

Now, the juggernaut behind hundreds of companies worth $2 trillion appears stopped in its tracks.

Beijing’s July 10 announcement that almost all businesses trying to go public in another country will require approval from a newly empowered cybersecurity regulator amounts to a death knell for Chinese initial public offerings in the U.S., according to long-time industry watchers.

“It’s unlikely there will be any U.S.-listed Chinese companies in five to 10 years, other than perhaps a few big ones with secondary listings,” said Paul Gillis, a professor at Peking University’s Guanghua School of Management in Beijing.

The clampdown, triggered by Didi Global Inc.’s decision to push ahead with a New York listing despite objections from regulators, is already sending shockwaves through markets. A gauge of U.S.-traded Chinese stocks has dropped almost 30% from its recent high. For investors in companies that have yet to list, there’s growing uncertainty over when they may get their money back. Wall Street firms are bracing for lucrative underwriting fees to dry up, while Hong Kong is set to benefit as Chinese companies look for alternative -- and politically safer -- venues closer to home.

Chinese shares fare far better in the U.S.
It’s hard to overstate the importance U.S. markets have held for Chinese firms. The first wave began selling American depositary receipts -- surrogate securities that allow investors to hold overseas shares -- in 1999. Since then more than 400 Chinese companies picked U.S. exchanges for their primary listings, raising more than $100 billion, including most of the country’s technology industry. Their stocks later benefited from one of the longest bull markets in history.

The Destination Viewed as Most Likely To Be Resilient After Covid-19

Hong Kong-based website operator China.com Corp. began the trend when it went public on the Nasdaq in 1999 during the dotcom bubble. The stock, under the symbol CHINA, surged 236% on its debut, enriching founders and backers, and showing Chinese internet firms a pathway to foreign capital -- if they could only find a way around the Communist Party’s strict regulatory controls.

Unlike companies in Hong Kong, whose laissez-faire approach to business meant there were few rules on company fund-raising, mainland-based private enterprises faced much higher hurdles. Foreign ownership in many industries, especially in the sensitive internet industry, was restricted, while an overseas listing required approval from China’s State Council, or cabinet.

To get around these obstacles, a compromise was found in the shape of a variable interest entity -- a complex corporate structure used by most ADRs including Didi and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. Under a VIE, which was pioneered by now-private Sina Corp. in 2000, Chinese companies are turned into foreign firms with shares that overseas investors can buy. Legally shaky, hard to understand, this solution nonetheless proved acceptable to U.S. investors, Wall Street and the Communist Party alike.

relates to China Signals End to $2 Trillion U.S. Stock Listing Juggernaut
Back in China, the government was taking steps to modernize its stock market, which only reopened in 1990, having been shut forty years earlier following the Communist revolution. In 2009, the country launched the Nasdaq-style ChiNext board in Shenzhen. Under Xi Jinping, who became president in 2013, access to the outside world was greatly increased, including exchange trading links with Hong Kong that allowed foreign investors to buy mainland equities directly. In 2018, China began a trial program to rival ADRs, but it failed to gain traction.

The most radical step came in 2019 when Shanghai opened a new stock venue called Star board, which minimized red tape, allowed unprofitable companies to list onshore for the first time, and got rid of a cap on first-day price moves. It also scrapped an unwritten valuation ceiling which forced companies to sell their shares at 23 times earnings or less. But mainland exchanges still don’t allow for dual-class shares, popular with tech firms because they give founders more voting power. Hong Kong introduced the structure in 2018.

The goal was to create an environment which would enable Chinese tech firms to list successfully at home, and be less reliant on U.S. capital. This need became all the more pressing as tensions between Beijing and Washington increased during the latter part of former President Donald Trump’s presidency. Trump introduced tough new rules that mean Chinese firms may be kicked off exchanges in a few years’ time if they refuse to hand over financial information to U.S. regulators.

Why China and U.S. Are Clashing Over Stock Listings: QuickTake

While secondary listings in Hong Kong picked up, Chinese firms still preferred New York, where it takes weeks rather than months to process an IPO application. China’s strict capital controls meant domestic exchanges couldn’t compete with New York on liquidity and far higher valuations for tech companies. China Inc. raised $13 billion through first time share sales in the U.S. this year alone.

After Didi’s contentious June 30 IPO, it appears the Communist Party decided it had had enough.

“The death of ADRs was inevitable,” said Fraser Howie, author of ‘Red Capitalism: The Fragile Financial Foundation of China’s Extraordinary Rise.’ “What’s interesting is the mold and template that’s achieving that result. It’s coming from a mindset of control and clamping down on business. That’s very different to a mindset of reform and building markets domestically.”

Beijing’s move to regulate overseas IPOs coincides with stricter controls over China’s technology firms, many of which have near-monopolies in their fields and vast pools of user data. This campaign to rein in the tech industry has accelerated in recent months as Xi seeks to limit the influence of the billionaires who control these firms.

For Chinese companies already listed in the U.S., what happens next largely depends on what China does with VIEs. Banning them outright would be unlikely, as it would force firms to delist from foreign exchanges, unwind that structure and then relist -- a costly process that would take years. The updated regulations are expected to be ready in a month or two, people familiar with the matter have said.

Hong Kong is increasingly looking like a viable alternative. For one, China plans to exempt Hong Kong IPOs from first seeking the approval of the country’s cybersecurity regulator, Bloomberg reported last week. In a forced U.S. delisting, firms that already sold shares in Hong Kong -- like Alibaba and JD.com -- can migrate their primary listing to the city. The delisted U.S. receipts, which can still trade off-exchange, won’t be worthless because they represent an economic interest in the company. Hong Kong’s open markets and greenback-pegged currency should facilitate the conversion.

Holders can sell their ADRs before they are delisted or convert them into the Hong Kong-listed common stock without much disruption. A company choosing to terminate its ADR program entirely can also pay out a dollar amount to investors.

Either way, it seems that the two-decade era that saw China’s most successful and powerful private firms list in the U.S. is coming to a close. The message from Beijing is clear: the Communist Party will have the final say on pretty much everything, including IPOs.

“It’s really important to own companies that are aligned with the direction of the Chinese government,” said Tom Masi, co-portfolio manager of GW&amp;K Investment Management’s emerging wealth strategy fund, which has half its money invested in Chinese stocks. “I would not be financing companies that are going to circumvent anything that the Chinese government wants to accomplish.”

stocks,"Why Owlet (OWLT), the baby cam/sock company, has likely become the most shorted stock in the world at 54.6% SI without people even realizing **Intro:** Owlet (OWLT), a company who helps parents keep their babies safe and greatly reduce the risk of SIDS (the leading cause of death among infants), has likely become the most shorted stock in the world. WTF? Yes, but how is this possible and why are short interest websites not showing this yet? Read on to find out:

**Background:** OWLT just officially IPO'ed last Friday after going public through a SP@C (formerly SBG) and so all the financial websites have not updated its short interest and/or total float yet. One of the unique things about a SP@C is that right before the official IPO or ""merger,"" a shareholder can trade in their shares for their net asset value of $10 instead of actually holding shares in the company. What’s been happening recently though is that large hedge funds buy up all the shares they can get at \~$9.98 right before merger and then trade them in for their $10 cash trust value for a guaranteed 0.2% profit. For every share that is traded in, the company will receive $10 lesson funding and there will also be one less share in the total float after the official IPO.

**The Short Position Is Taken:** With SP@Cs getting smacked across the board recently, a profitable strategy has been to short shares prior to the official IPO since that is when the $10 floor is removed for a SP@C. Therefore, Hedge Fund ABC sees an opportunity in shorting OWLT in anticipation of it dropping in price after merger. So, they short as many shares (1.77 million) as they can.  More specifically, a large chunk of those shares were shorted at the end of June when the stock was at $10, which for the most part would only be done by a principle short planning to hold their short into deSP@C (merger). At the time, OWLT had 23 million shares total, so it wasn’t THAT high of a short interest ratio.

**The Total Available Shares Reduces by 86%:** As mentioned in the background, there have been an increasing amount of SP@C shares bought by hedge funds and traded in to secure a 0.2% profit. So, Hedge Fund XYZ decides to do this with OWLT, which was trading at $9.97-9.98 for about a month before the official IPO date. Ultimately, they buy up an incredible 86% of the float trade them in for $10 before merger. Sure, Owlet now has 86% less of the cash in the SP@C trust  to make their life-saving baby products but oh well, hedge funds gotta get paid their 0.2% ya know? As a result, this removes 86% of the shares available from the total float, which means that the original 23 million float is reduced to only 3.24 million shares.

**Putting It Together:** With these two moves, OWLT now has a float of only 3.24 million shares with 1.77 million of those shares sold short based on the most recent data from the end of June. (Could there more or less shares shorted since that time? Yes, but I'm guessing if anything short interest got even higher since almost every SP@C these past two weeks has been dropping like a fly after their official IPO debut, further confirming the hedge fund's short strategy.)

With 1.77 million shares sold short, this would equate to a short interest ratio of 54.6%, which according to [highshortinterest.com](http://highshortinterest.com/) would make it by far the most shorted stock in the world with second place coming in at 39.14%. They don't have OWLT at the top of the list right now because financial websites have not updated the total available float as the company technically just went public on Friday (July 16).

Given the information, I wouldn't want to be short the stock in a situation like this. I'm betting that the people who are, are unaware of the situation and might get caught very off side. Being caught off side, in size, is a very tough spot to be in especially considering the low volume/float. It'll be interesting to see what happens in the coming days.

**TL;DR:**

* Hedge Fund ABC shorts OWLT as much as they can (1.77 million shares) before the official IPO date and $10 floor is removed.
* Hedge Fund XYZ buys up as many of the shares as they can (86% of the float) and trades them in to make 0.2% profit, subsequently reducing the total available float by 86%.
* As a result, based on the latest data, OWLT now has a total float of only 3.24 million shares with 54.6% of those shares shorted. With this small of a float and high of short interest, Hedge Fund ABC's short position would be incredibly vulnerable if people start to catch on.

**Data backing this thesis:**

[Bloomberg terminal screenshot showing total amount of shares shorted at 1.77M](https://imgur.com/a/huRQv9P). Note: the total float hasn't been updated yet, which is why % float short only says 7.68.

[Shortsqueeze.com also verifying short interest data for OWLT at 1.77M shares](https://shortsqueeze.com/shortinterest/stock/SBG.htm) (OWLT was formerly known as SBG back when it was a SP@C. OWLT's price is now $9.10)

As a result, there will be approximately $32.4 million remaining in the trust account following redemptions.""* (Note: originally, there were 23 million shares available for a total trust value of $230 million).

[PIPE participants were not allowed to short, and their shares won't be registered and added to the float for many weeks.

**About Owlet:**

If you've read this far, I might as well also share a bit about the company itself. From what I can tell, Owlet actually a pretty good company. Here's their [investor presentation](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1004/3036/files/Owlet_SPAC_Presentation_Deck_Feb-2021_Final.pdf?v=1613532833).

From slide 24, you can see their smart sock and baby monitoring product has an NPS score of 76 and 68, which is very high, on par or higher than any Apple product. From slide 24, you can see that they are developing a whole platform of products beyond their smart sock and cam to help parents take care of their babies. On Glassdoor, they have a 4.6 rating and 100% CEO approval. Amazon product reviews are all 4.5+ stars with a Fakespot score of B. Nice.

On slide 7, it shows their valuation was $1.39B at a price of $10. At its current price of $9.10 and reduced cash position as a result of the shares traded in, the valuation is now $1.1B. Considering that they are growing at \~50%, have expected 2022 revenues of $175M, gross margins of \~50%, it honestly doesn’t seem like a bad valuation to me.  Mainly though, I'm in this play for the squeeze."

stocks,"In the absence of buyers of shares, explain how a stock price will go up. in my experience, Ive come to the conclusion that market sentiment matters more than any fundamental aspect of any company.

You can have a company making zero revenue be worth billions of dollars, and as long as no one sells their shares, the company will maintain this value.

On the other side, if a company has zero traction, no matter how well they do, if there are zero buyers, it will stay stagnant.

As for ratio multipliers, these only remain relevant so long as there are buyers and sellers. For example,
if there is zero demand for shares but increasing assets, then the book value will decrease.

With stocks often trading at multiples higher than revenue, some as high as 30-50x, how can you reasonably justify valuations higher than this?

My belief is

- fundamentals and technicals of companies drive buyers to buy shares, leading to increased price.

-in the absence of buyers, the share price will stay the same.

3. Due to new compliance requirements by my new employer, I will be restrained in sharing/speaking to some of the topics. I appreciate everyone understanding that in advance.

With that said, let's get straight down to today's topic.

As a background, I have worked in investment banking and equity/credit research. When I was getting started, the best way I learned was by reading books like Peter Lynch's investing series, Warren Buffett, Bill Ackman, etc.

However, I've been increasingly noticing that a lot of people are leaving out some very important components to a stock analysis or taking big leaps in assumptions.

For instance, many people nowadays seem to be making premature conclusions along the lines of

""the US government is pushing for clean energy initiatives and therefore, Tesla stock will be going up"" or

""the real estate market in the US is very hot right now and it's a great time to buy a home"" or

""Amazon will report amazing quarterly earnings so the stock is a buy"".

And by the way, it's very natural and understandable why they make these kinds of arguments. In fact, it's human nature to think in this way.

The reason is that we have a cognitive bias called **""hindsight bias"".**

It basically means that people tend to believe they knew the results before they happened.

For example, when the Bucs won the Super Bowl last year, some claimed they knew it was inevitable.

Or some claim that they knew that the stock market would recover in less than a year.

Because of this strong belief that we already ""knew"" the results before they happened, we can also predict results going forward, which leads to a **confirmation bias** but I won't get into details in this memo.

**My point is that we need to be aware of all the cognitive biases affecting our decision-making because we all have them.** Some are more easily influenced by them than others.

The reason why I bring up these biases is that a stock analysis needs to contain a bias-free forecast.

I'll provide a sample pitch that I made a while back for illustration purposes (**for those who'd like a copy of this sample pitch, please add your email to the memo distribution list in Midasinvestors page and you'll receive a copy).**

\[chart deleted because the forum doesn't allow it\]

Now, I understand that some of you may be just getting started and I'm not saying you need to know the ins and outs of this one-pager.

I want to emphasize the three components to the analysis:

1. Investment Thesis
2. Valuation
3. Risks
4. Investment Thesis

Most people are aware of the first part. We know to invest in ""companies that produce things we are familiar with"" like Apple, Disney, Spotify, etc. But that's not enough of an investment thesis.

It's because what if a competitor comes out with a better product at a better price point? What if the industry dies in a matter of years (which can happen as evidenced by Blackberry, Xerox, iPods, etc.)? What if the management executes a terrible merger?

My point is that a thesis should explain why there is a **strong competitive advantage that's durable in the company.**

What's to keep Thor Industries the largest manufacturer of recreational vehicles? Because it has the largest and most efficient manufacturing plants and largest dealership network in the world. There is a high barrier-to-entry for any new entrants to compete. Management has been known to be great capital allocators, meaning they know when to issue debt to build a new manufacturing plant, acquire a business, or buy back its own stock.

These points back up the claim that Thor has a durable competitive advantage and will keep the business growing.

2) Valuation

**Second part to a stock analysis is arguably the most important component: the valuation.**

All great investors argue your entry point is one of your biggest factors in making an investment decision.

Yes, the company's growth can explain the heightened valuation but when I hear that argument, I always point to this graph below.

\[chart deleted because the forum doesn't allow it\]

It took Microsoft 15 years to recover from its peak at the dot com bubble.

Now I know some of you will immediately argue back that this is not a dot com bubble but that's not the point I wanted to make.

I'm trying to say that leaving out a valuation analysis is like buying a house without knowing what the price is.

**""Amazon is a buy because it's got 1), 2), 3), etc."" without talking about its valuation is like saying ""this house is a buy because it's in a great location, newly remodeled, etc."" without saying how much it is selling for.**

Valuation can be represented in multiple ways. Here are some basic ratios to look at.

Growth companies: because they earn negative income, you should pay more attention to the growth story.

P/S, EV/S (enterprise value to sales), P/Gross profit, PEG (PE to growth ratio)

Mature companies: because they have peaked in their growth cycle, they have consistent cash flows

EV/EBITDA, P/E, EV/FCF (free cash flow)

Next step is to assess whether these ratios are reasonable.

Going back to the real estate example, if you knew the house you were looking at is priced at $1.5 million, that doesn't really tell you anything.

You need to look at how much rent you can charge the house for, what nearby houses are selling at, and recent transactions in the neighborhood.

Similarly, you need to look at the P/S ratios and gross profit margins of competitors in the same industry to see if your computed numbers line up well.

If Thor is trading at 15x PE ratio, it may sound cheap but when you realize that its competitors are trading at 8x PE ratio, you know that it's overvalued compared to its peers.

You need to figure out why your company is overvalued/undervalued compared to its peers and whether it's justified. If it is undervalued for no good reason, such as there is a CFO scandal, then it could be a good opportunity.

3) Risks

This is also one of the most overlooked component to a stock analysis.

In any investment, there are risks. The simple reason is that nothing is ""guaranteed"" in the world.

Are you guaranteed to be healthy tomorrow? No, but the chances are, you are much more likely to be healthy than sick.

Is Amazon guaranteed to go up in the next 5 years? No, but chances are high.

**Your role as an analyst is to increase your odds in your bet.**

The more analysis you do, the more you eliminate the risks of making a bad investment.

To summarize today's memo, I strongly encourage you to approach a stock analysis from a multi-dimensional level.

Don't buy a house just because it's newly built, or it's in a great location, or your rental incomes are high.

Buy it because the price doesn't reflect the upcoming developments in the neighborhood that'll result in home price appreciation, or because your house is undervalued compared to recent houses that sold in the nearby area, or because the house has an opportunity for price appreciation through minor renovations.

Thank you for reading and please share any feedback! It helps me and the forum to grow. Very much appreciated."
stocks,"At what point does interest accrued begun to overtake deposits? I have this cool freeware free compound interest calculator.  Not sure where I got it.  Anyways I was fooling aroumd with some minimums today to see how much can be earned from just a little saving.

Anyways I plugged in a modest 8% interest rate and a $200 month deposit and set it for 5 years.  

I started from scratch with 0 initial deposit and see that after 5 years my deposits of $12k were more than the $2080 interest I earned with 8% interest rate.

I noticed that with the same contribution rate ($200 month) and a initial $20k deposit the deposit and interest earned after 5 years were almost equal.

After an initial $20k deposit and the same 5 years, 8% return rate your interest earned started to outweigh your deposits after 5 years.

For example, if I start with $30k and contribute $200 a month at 8% interest rate after 5 years my deposits were $12k and interest earned was $16k.

Noe I'm kind of wondering what factors determine when your interest earned outweigh your deposits.

I would assume that there are multiple factors that could influence this outcome?"

Not investment advice. I just think they look interesting. 

Please feel free to highlight a couple from your own country.

LON:SLP - Sylvania Platinum

Actually derives most of its revenue from Rhodium these days. 
This company is trading on a tiny p/e - it’s just too cheap I think. 
£280m market cap. 
Net cash over $100m at end March
Last quarter net profit of $40m. 

Operations are all based in South Africa. The company produces platinum group metals by processing the tailings of other producers. It’s lower risk than mining, but means they are reliant on their host-mines for tailings inputs. 
Huge margins, dividend paying. Final quarter update should be this month, with annual report in September. 
They will hopefully give an indication of what they will do with all that cash!

…

LON: GAW - Games Workshop

The company that owns the Warhammer series of worlds. 

I used to play the table top war game as a kid, and the game is stronger than ever. 
Revenue has tripled since 2015. 

I love this company because of the richness of the IP. The worlds are enormous and they keep building up the story.  That’s an incredible asset, and the company is getting better and better at monetising it. 

The warhammer world extends to books, computer games, and hopefully soon a tv series. 

On a forward p/e of around 30, it’s not cheap.  If the growth can keep going, it may still be good value"
stocks,"How to identify a ""Meme"" stock? I am stuck in a Meme stock, now what? Was this Meme stock a poor choice, will there be upside? Happy Sunday All. I hope everyone is stacking them greens! I dont care how you do it as long as you do it! There are plenty of different ways to make money. For myself, I try and make money as safe as possible. This post is about the risky ""MEME's.. 

So the first thing you would like to do is to identify this early morning. US securities are traded as early as 4AM east coast time. These trades come worldwide and in the US come VIA WEBULL. I trade mainly with a TD, ETRADE and FIDELITY and these start at 7am. Same as Schwab. So once you are up you can look at the most heavily traded stocks. These will all be MEMEs..... why? because if the volume is 20-30% normal daily volume by 7-8am you better believe it has been hyped! The Memes at times have traded near 50x normal! Check ORPH and even CLOV when CLOV hit 30!

The next step is to try and get yourself familiar with LEVEL 2 along with a minute chart nearby. Unfortunately, for myself I use 2 cell phones as I am working. I did have a very good look at TD Think or SWIM desktop and was able to see magic with CRSR! Once you have level 2's it will be easier to identify the auctions, buyers and sellers. What I didnt say in the video is if you plan on doing this alot it is ok to setup a stop loss...I have never actually done that. If you make 5 of these trades and 1 is a loss you will still come out ahead.

I got stuck.....now what? You're in luck if it was a meme then Reddit Army. Your best bet is circling the wagon and being a cheerleader. Contact the Mods, the Posters and see if they will allow more posts to get fuel for the army.. If you garner enough interest maybe the army can save you!

Some recent MEMEs that have value CRSR had an amazing report and makes money with growth. I believe it is worth 40-42 without an army. UWMC about 10, RKT about 24. These 3 company's make money and have growth. You do not have to look out 1-2 years. Pray for the army to save you. In fact UWMC announced a 300 million buyback which jumped the stock from 6.25 to 9+ in a week!

Good luck everyone.. Let's make money!"
stocks,"The Weekly DD - Global-E Online (GLBE): The Uncut Diamond  **Overview**

What is exactly is Global-E? They are a company that integrates with e-commerce platforms to remove complexity with international transactions and provide localized solutions that improve the online shopping experience. The core of the services revolve around the following (from the S-1):

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;“The vast capabilities of our end-to-end platform include interaction with shoppers in their native languages, market-adjusted pricing, payment options tailored to local market preferences, compliance with local consumer regulations and requirements such as customs duties and taxes, shipping services, after-sales support and returns management. These elements are unified under the Global-e platform to enhance the shopper experience and enable merchants to capture the cross-border opportunity.”

&amp;#x200B;

They are the “plug and play” of making e-commerce international. Their vast network of APIs allow a customer to simply integrate their platform and seamlessly begin selling across different borders and languages. Here’s what they do.

&amp;#x200B;

Currently, Global-E supports:

* Local messaging in over 25 languages
* Purchases in over 100 currencies
* Accepts over 150 payment methods
* A multitude of competitively-priced shipping options

&amp;#x200B;

**Business Model**

Global-E generates revenues by charging a fee (“service fee”) for the integration of their platform into a merchant’s services. Service fees are highly variable based on transaction volume, destination markets, level of customer service provided, etc, and are generated as a percentage of the Gross Merchandise Value (“GMV”) that flows through the platform. Global-E mandatorily bundles certain components of their integrated platform solutions that they believe are essential for achieving improved sales conversions from international traffic. However, their fulfillment services are offered on an optional basis and merchants can choose to utilize those services or cancel at any time. Think of it as bundling service A and B to have the greatest effect, while offering service C as an add-on component. Service fees make up for approximately 35% of revenue while fulfillment services are currently accounting for roughly 65%.

&amp;#x200B;

**Partnerships &amp; why they use Global-E**

Global-E has formed many key technological as well as service partnerships. These third-party e-commerce platforms include: Salesforce Commerce Cloud, Shopify, BigCommerce, Magento Commerce, SAP, WooCommerce, PrestaShop, and others.

&amp;#x200B;

*What they do for merchants?*

Some of the key benefits they provide for merchants are:

* increased sales conversions: converting international traffic
* offloading complexities: handling local pricing, payment collection, import duties, fraud, etc 
* reduction of risk: reduce legal complexity, manage import duties and taxes, handle compliance
* enabling growth to new markets: allowing merchants flexibility to expand to cross-border opportunities

All while emphasizing merchant branding. The customer always faces the digital store-front and never leaves the brand page to check-out.

&amp;#x200B;

*What they do for shoppers?*

Global-E’s goal is to offer a frictionless shopping journey, regardless of the origin of the customer. This means:

* Localized languages
* Re-pricing in local currencies
* Handling cross-border payments
* Accurately pre-price import duties and taxes and include them in the final cost of the product
* Delivery: using an extensive network of over 20 shipping carriers they are able to offer multiple shipping modes at attractive rates.
* After-sale support and returns

Merchants integrating Global-E into their platform generally experience a significantly higher international traffic conversion rate (often exceeding 60%). The Global-E platform removes many complexities involved with international expansion. They already have more than 400 merchants, from small companies to globally-recognized retailers, on the platform across various diversified verticals.

&amp;#x200B;

**Shopify Deal**

As mentioned above, one of Global-E most lucrative partners lies with Shopify making them the exclusive third-party and cross-border solution across the large network of Shopify merchants. Shopify knows what kind of business that will bring for Global-E and thus Shopify has bought 7.75 million shares and acquired a **6.5% stake** in the company. As Shopify grows Global-E grows and Shopify knows this, hence the stake in a company that reflects their own revenues by proxy.

&amp;#x200B;

**TAM, &amp; CAGR**

First came the transition to domestic e-commerce as well as sourcing and reselling products from China (aka Dropshipping). Next is going to be the transition of global e-commerce and cross-border sales. According to this 225 page **research by GlobeNewsWire**, the global cross-border B2C e-commerce market was 780 billion in 2019 and expected to grow at a CAGR of 27% through 2026 where it will become a 4.82 trillion market.

&amp;#x200B;

**Global-E’s Smart Insights**

One of the company’s strengths lies within sophisticated “Smart Insights” they use to scale their applications. Smart Insights is a “big data” network that uses various metrics such as country, price-point, and shopper behaviors allowing Global-E to provide highly-optimized experience for shoppers. This ends up driving increased conversion rates and revenues for the merchant and a better overall experience for the shopper. The company has noted by integrating big-data into their platform they can experience “economies of scale” as well as “economies of skill” enabling them to optimize merchants’ cross-border sales. These insights are continuously expanding as they collect additional data points along the purchasing journey.

&amp;#x200B;

**Competitive Advantage &amp; Growth Opportunities**

What seems to be becoming more of a trend since 2020 and even more so now in 2021 are corporation’s use of big data. I’m not talking about basic user data such as age, gender, location, but more on the lines of vastly large information networks. These networks can utilize things such as time spent on page, scrolls, and clicks all in one massive database. Global-E differentiates themselves through their main data asset (“Smart Insights”) that informs them on certain decisions and is able to optimize how merchants sell their product across different borders. They integrate this data network into a flywheel effect, for example: their current analytics drives more sales to merchants, which then feeds new data back into the system, which then allows for higher optimization and better conversions. They feed into each other back and forth getting smarter with each website visitor and purchase. This aligns perfectly for their products “Net Dollar Retention Rate” of 134% and 172% in 2019 and 2020, respectively.

&amp;#x200B;

Global-E attributes much of their growth to being a first mover (and doing it right) in the cross-border e-commerce space. Their success has been accelerated by several key factors, such as:

* Accelerated shift towards e-commerce outpacing traditional retail
* Cross-border e-commerce growing faster than domestic e-commerce
* Their merchant’s strategic focus on D2C sales, maintaining relationship with shoppers globally
* The complexity and limitations of leaving the merchant responsible for implementing what Global-E offers. This doesn’t come down to just a cost, but also time-intensive as well as being difficult to maintain and scale
* Covid-19 tailwinds

&amp;#x200B;

As a result of the above and other market factors, the cross-borders e-commerce market is expected to continue the surge in growth. I previously mentioned the forecast in TAM however, Forrester, a research company, also expects the cross-border e-commerce markets to reach $736 billion by 2023.

Global-E has several opportunities to expand on existing channels and capture new markets. This can be done with:

* Growth through existing portfolio of merchants and strengthening relationships
* Acquiring new merchants in existing geographies
* Expanding in new geographies that they don’t have exposure to
* Continue to expand and innovate their platform
* Continue to develop strategic partnerships (with key brands and players)

&amp;#x200B;

**Risks**

Many of Global-E’s risks fall under the category of general business risks. Some of these include: retaining old merchants and attracting new ones, failing to enhance the platform as well as successfully competing against new and existing competition, failing to manage growth, pricing pressures from competition, and being highly dependent on cross-border regulations, sales, and operations.

&amp;#x200B;

**Revenues, Scale, &amp; Profitability**

In FY 2020 Global-E helped process 4.6 million orders for their merchants generating $136.4 million. Their Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) also grew to 774 million for the same period. Other impressive metrics were their net dollar retention rate and gross profit as % of revenue both of which continue to climb at 172% and 31.9%, respectively. Stellar!

&amp;#x200B;

Although the company has recently turned a profit while growing top-line revenue and GMV at a high pace. The company suggested that short-term profitability might be sacrificed due to the expansions they are making to cover larger markets. As noted from the S-1:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;“We expect our operating expenses to significantly increase over the next several years as we hire additional personnel, expand into new geographies, expand our partnerships, operations, and infrastructure, continue to enhance our platform, develop and expand its features, integrations and capabilities, expand and improve our service offering and increase our spending on sales and marketing. We intend to continue to build and enhance our platform through internal research and development and we may also selectively pursue acquisitions.”

&amp;#x200B;

Let’s take a quick peak at their consolidated statement of operations. Note the revenue growth and total operating expenses that *decreas*e, as a percentage of total revenue, as revenues increase (almost doubles YoY).

&amp;#x200B;

**Valuation**

Looking at GLBE’s valuation it is clear that you pay a premium when owning this company.

&amp;#x200B;

*The Good*

GLBE is growing revenue at 134% YoY.

Gross margins are improving while the company continues to scale.

Many tech and services partnerships they can piggy back on.

&amp;#x200B;

*The Bad*

Consistent profitability could be years away as the company is investing heavily into their own expansion of current and new markets.

GLBE is currently trading at roughly 50x price to sales and 260 forward P/E.

&amp;#x200B;

*Up for Debate*

Global-E has almost no long-term debt, but current liabilities are stacking up while the company is not generating much FCF. I wouldn’t expect them to be generating this much FCF this early in the game after their IPO.

Lock-up expiration on August 11, 2021.

&amp;#x200B;

**Final Thoughts**

In my opinion Global-E is top of the class when it comes to their business. They are growing extremely fast while improving margins and this is the premium you would pay versus investing in a “stable” company generating tons of FCF, but not much growth. Due to the nature of being a high-growth stock there will naturally be more volatility around the trade. While it’s currently trading at 50x price/sales I am more likely to shy away from entering a new position. We could see this stock swing to 40x p/s and potentially enter on the dips.

This is somewhat of a chicken or the egg situation because there might not be any dips to buy with this kind of growth. For example, at current growth rates (100-135% YoY) if stock price is maintained it would only be trading at less than half it’s price/sales valuation only one year from now. This is definitely a stock to monitor closely if you are wanting to find the right entry point for a long-term hold.

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR;**

1. Global-E is an “enabler” that allows e-commerce and digital stores to seamlessly integrate international transactions. They deal with tasks from translations, currency re-pricing, international shipping &amp; returns, compliance &amp; tax regulations, etc.
2. GLBE integrates their proprietary “Smart Insights” application that analyses customer shopping and transaction data to continuously improve on sales conversions. The feedback loop is always learning as it collects more and more data along each customer’s purchase journey.
3. GLBE is trading at a rich valuation given their total revenue was $136 million in 2020. However, they are growing top-line revenues and Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) over 130% Y.o.Y. Shopify holds a 6.5% stake in Global-E as GLBE facilitates a large amount of transactions on the Shopify network. As Shopify grows, GLBE grows.
4. GLBE is growing through many tailwinds such as those from covid lockdowns and accelerated shift toward e-commerce outpacing traditional retail. They’ve got an opportunity to expand into more international regions, strengthen relationships with existing merchants, while continuing to expand and improve their platform."
stocks,"Just a rule of thumb when buying a stock on the OTC, AMEX or other Exchanges. Also, be careful of Penny stocks, Must do Due diligence As the title says this post is just going over some basic rules of thumb. If anything it can be positive reinforcement to the seasoned trader 

So naturally, when we see a stock thats $1 or even pennies we just feel like it isnt much to invest. We feel like we have more leverage and can buy more. What we should be concerned about though is % gain as well as risk. You buy a $1 stock and the risk is 90% and invested $100. What you actually did was roll the dice and gambled. How about buying a stock thats $10 that will go up 10%. We all make those mistakes at some point.

OTC or AMEX arent as regulated as the Nasdaq or NYSE so personally the only OTC stock that I have traded the last several months is FNMA. It has been a few months but I do not feel like I am taking a huge risk trading it.

Personally, I do not buy penny stocks at the moment. I have in the past and if you're willing to take the risk/bet you can be rewarded. I do not take to many risks personally, if any. Many times these penny stocks are a pump and dump and in the old days were sent via emails to the masses. It is much easier now with social media and Reddit!

A company under $200 million you just have to investigate. There are alot of good companies under $200. Just make sure you really check out the financials and sales. It is very easy for a company under this market cap to be manipulated. They may trade under $1 million a day and you can have a small group making it seem that the stock is hot!

Lastly, we can not assume that a stock under $5 is a deal. There are good company's under $5 but like above we must do some research. Does the company have cash, sales, debt? Are they making money? Generally company's do not like to be under $10. It is offensive and many times people on the street assume a stock price reflects a company's health so they do not like the thought of being a bad company.

Good luck everyone."
stocks,"If you started investing this year, don’t fret. I know I’ve spoken to people on here in the same situation as me. You started investing at the beginning of 2021 and you’ve been trading sideways since you started. Your portfolio has been jumping between positive and negative all-time. I’m not worried and you shouldn’t be either. 

I would assume that most people finding themselves in this scenario aren’t index fund or “safe” investors. You’re trying to build a high growth portfolio for the long term like I am. 

For reference, here is my portfolio breakdown:

“Safer” steady growers - HON, WMT, ABBV, GE, SONY, CLF, NEE*, and BHVN*. I see NEE and BHVN as safer compared to the other high growth stocks I own. BHVN has a very promising pipeline of drugs and has grown a lot as of late. NEE may be the most promising renewable energy company in the market. 

Mega-cap tech - AAPL and GOOGL.

More speculative, high-growth - BABA, AMD, ZG, NIO, NOK, PSFE, PLTR, SOFI, DKNG, MTZ, ETSY, and STEM.

That’s my portfolio. 22 positions as of now. Out of those, here are the ones I’m currently negative in - BABA, ZG, PSFE, PLTR, SOFI, DKNG, MTZ, and GE. Besides GE, the rest of those are more speculative and more or what I would consider high growth. That’s what has been getting hit as of late. I’m not worried because I am confident these companies will do well long term and the stock prices will inevitably go up. In the short term, I’ll continue to average down through DCA. I’ll grit my teeth through the risks of inflation and rising interest rates. Short term it may be rough, but long term I think it will pay off. I will not sell any of these companies. I may add a few “safer” companies or buy up some VTI, but I think this aggressive approach will be well worth it."

I downloaded etoro but have got stuck pending verification. They've sent me a pdf with a bunch questions like jobs held for the last 5 years. I don't have a printer and it just seems like too much hassle.

Are there any other apps you could recommend for UK use which have etfs other than etoro and t212? Or has anyone else had to go through these extra checks with etoro??

stocks,"How would you define ""trading with out emotion""? I hear this phrase tossed around all the time, but what exactly does it mean? And how does it make you a better trader? Is it simply not FOMOing into hype stocks and selling when you are panicking over a price? Is there more to it? In a way it seems like any stock trade is emotional anyway you look at it, because you are picking a stock that you are feeling good about, as in it's chance to produce a profit for you. Can anyone give me a good summary of what ""trading without emotion"", actually is?"

I don't mean to simply add one more share to a position where you're already up 500%, but rather starting a new position. Which companies are so attractive at current valuations to warrant a purchase?

stocks,"What is the foundation for stock prices? I am wondering what is propping up stock prices, or rather what is the value of buying a stock? Okay, in the most simple case you will buy a stock and hope that you can sell it later for more to someone else, this is basic supply and demand. But my question is, is there anything else that is dictating a stock besides its popularity and how much people buy it in the most fundamental sense? I know there are dividends, but from what I've seen dividends are very low and usually you wouldn't really consider dividends when buying a stock. So is the only motivation for buying a stock is that you can sell it for more later to someone else? In that case the whole system seems a bit artificial, as in there's no 'real' value that the stocks provide. The only driving force behind stocks then is people buying them and hoping they make some money, but of course some people who are hoping to make money will lose and that's what keeps the ball rolling. In this case, does it really matter if a company is doing bad or good when considering the direction of a stock?"

stocks,"GM has signed an agreement to extract lithium from beneath the Salton Sea With the rise of the electric car, lithium supplies have become a relatively hot investment topic. I've seen quite a few posts in here and other investing subs about investing in the supply chain, and this development sounds interesting from that perspective, and how it might position GM as an ESG opportunity (if they're successful, I can personally see GM buying CTR outright).


https://www.autoweek.com/news/green-cars/a37029490/gm-will-suck-lithium-from-the-salton-sea-to-make-batteries/

&gt;So GM has just signed an innovative agreement with a company called Controlled Thermal Resources to extract Lithium from superheated waters beneath the Salton Sea in the desert of Southern California.

It isn't entirely clear how effective CTR's method is, but if you take their (probably very optimistic) word for it, quoting the article:

&gt;CTR should start lithium deliveries to GM by 2024. If the Salton Sea pans out as well as it should, the area could provide 40 percent of the world’s lithium—all of it American-made. 


Standard disclaimers: not investment advice, not an investment adviser, do your own research, the intent of this post is discussion alone. I have no direct investment in GM or CTR."
stocks,"Are interest rates determined by the market? I’m spending time learning about finance and in particular stock valuation models like DCF and GGM. These utilize interest rates, generally using the risk free rate of treasury bonds as a sort of benchmark. 

Im a bit confused on how these rates come about. As I understand it, the interest rates are determined by market forces and the inverse relationship between yields and price. If more people buy a bond, price goes up, and yield goes down because the coupon payments are fixed. But if yields are low, people would want to sell bonds because they can get better returns elsewhere. 

Basically I’m confused as to what leads what. It seems to me that decisions about what to buy or sell are dependent upon interest rates and yields. But at the same time yields and interest rates are determined by what people want to buy and sell. It’s circular. Am I misunderstanding something here? Thanks!"

But a fourth payment isn't included in the [draft bipartisan infrastructure](https://www.cnet.com/personal-finance/bipartisan-infrastructure-deal-what-does-it-really-promise/) plan or any of President Joe Biden's recent proposals. The one definite form of aid going to millions of families in 2021 is the expanded [child tax credit](https://www.cnet.com/personal-finance/taxes/child-tax-credit-irs-is-sending-15-billion-in-payments-this-week-heres-what-to-know/) program, which started this week. This year, even parents who don't make enough to pay income taxes can qualify for the monthly payments of up to $300 per child.   
&gt;  
&gt;Though some lawmakers had called for more stimulus money in the spring, many now argue it's less of a priority due to signs of a post-lockdown economic rebound -- like [new jobless claims](https://www.dol.gov/ui/data.pdf) dropping to the lowest since last year. But the call for ongoing relief aid is gaining public support.

stocks,"Why I Believe CureVac $CVAC is a Solid Long-term Investment [Their work includes rabies vaccines, lassa/yellow fever vaccines and many more] CureVac N.V. is a German biopharmaceutical company that develops therapies based on messenger RNA. Legally domiciled in the Netherlands and headquartered in Tübingen, Germany, the company was founded in 2000 by Ingmar Hoerr, Steve Pascolo, Florian von der Mulbe, Günther Jung, and Hans-Georg Rammensee.

CureVac reached $120.43 in February per share and was battered upon news their COVID vaccine was 48% effective against all COVID variants (77% efficacy in preventing moderate to serious illness and 100% efficacy in preventing hospitalization or death -- among participants ages 18 to 60.)

However, what most fail to realize is the COVID vaccine is a small part of their product pipeline/portfolio. 

The German government has invested more than 300 million euros into CureVac. 

CureVac has both appointed a new COO and that one of the company’s cofounders has resigned from the board to focus full-time on improving the manufacturing process for its RNA vaccines.

CureVac has received funding from the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation.

The company's focus is on developing vaccines for infectious diseases and drugs to treat cancer and rare diseases. CureVac has entered into various collaborations with organizations, including agreements with [Boehringer Ingelheim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boehringer_Ingelheim), [Sanofi Pasteur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanofi_Pasteur), [Johnson &amp; Johnson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnson_%26_Johnson), [Genmab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genmab), the [Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_%26_Melinda_Gates_Foundation), [Eli Lilly and Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eli_Lilly_and_Company), [GlaxoSmithKline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GlaxoSmithKline), [Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_for_Epidemic_Preparedness_Innovations), the [International AIDS Vaccine Initiative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_AIDS_Vaccine_Initiative), and the [government of Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_of_Germany)

In October 2013 CureVac launched a collaboration with [Janssen Pharmaceuticals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janssen_Pharmaceuticals) Inc., a [Johnson &amp; Johnson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnson_%26_Johnson) company, for the development of novel flu vaccines. Also in 2013, CureVac announced the fourth in a series of partnerships with the [Cancer Research Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_Research_Institute) and [Ludwig Cancer Research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_Cancer_Research) to enable clinical testing of novel cancer immunotherapy treatment options.

In March 2014, CureVac won a €2 million prize awarded by the European Commission to stimulate new vaccine technologies. Later, in July 2014, CureVac signed an exclusive license agreement with [Sanofi Pasteur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanofi_Pasteur) to develop and commercialize an mRNA-based prophylactic vaccine. By September 2014, the company licensed the global rights for its Phase I candidate – CV9202 – to [Boehringer Ingelheim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boehringer_Ingelheim). Boehringer was to conduct trials using the [mRNA vaccine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MRNA_vaccine) in combination with [afatinib](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afatinib) in advanced and/or metastatic [epidermal growth factor receptor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermal_growth_factor_receptor) (EGFR) mutated [non-small cell lung cancer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-small_cell_lung_cancer) (NSCLC) as well as inoperable stage III NSCLC.

In March 2015, a CureVac investor, the [Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_%26_Melinda_Gates_Foundation), agreed to provide separate funding for several projects to develop prophylactic vaccines based on CureVac's proprietary mRNA platform. By September 2015, CureVac entered into a collaboration with the [International AIDS Vaccine Initiative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_AIDS_Vaccine_Initiative) (IAVI) to accelerate the development of AIDS vaccines, utilizing immunogens developed by IAVI and partners, delivered via CureVac's mRNA technology. That same month, CureVac announced it would open a United States hub in [Boston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston), [Massachusetts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts).

In accordance with its deal with Lilly, the company began construction on a production facility in 2016.

I know the COVID vaccine was a huge letdown ... but the hit the stock took was way too extreme for a 21-year-old company that now has the sturdy research bones necessary to continue building healing vaccines well into the future. Their RNA printer is now ready to start new trials and they have so much more in the pipeline (rabies vaccines, lassa/yellow fever vaccines, Respirational syncytial virus vaccine,  Other infectious diseases vaccines, Rota, malaria, universal influenza vaccines, Cutaneous melanoma cures, adenoidcystic carcinoma cures, squamous cell cancer of skin, head and neck cures, Non-small cell lung cancer cures, Tumor associated antigens (TAA) cures, Shared neo-antigens, Cas9 gene-editing, Ocular diseases, Lung respiratory diseases, Therapeutic antibodies).

This is a $10+ billion company that has a fantastic future ahead of it for long-term investors. Short term, they suffered a blow, but the ding their stock took was way too large. 

This is all just my opinion and I hold 500 shares of $CVAC."

IMO, shilling stocks and manipulating the market, like many people argue is happening, isn't nearly as lucrative as you'd think. I'm not saying it hasn't happened, or couldn't happen, but that's not where their bread is buttered. As we all know, nobody knows anything! So, sure, they might recommend a pump that gets dumped, but they could just as easily promote a stock that moons. Nobody knows wtf they're talking about!

I think it's more advantageous for them to appear as reputable and trustworthy as possible and NOT shill stocks. That way, more people think they're legit and tune in. 

If there is anything underhanded going on, it would be convincing people like you and me that we can beat the indexes. The computers and algos know how to take advantage of retail investors much more handily than TV personalities can. And it's widely understood that the majority of stock-pickers underperform the indexes. Yet if you listen to these shows enough, their underlying message is clear. ""You can do better than the indexes."" ""It's a stock-picker's market!"" The more of you that are out there ready to be taken advantage of, the better it is for their Wall Street buddies.

Hope some of the new guys will get benefitted from my post who are less than 1 year in stock market and will learn a lot definitely from comment section if anyone share their experience. Here are from my experience -

1. **Always 30% Cash on hand. --&gt; Very Important  while everything is going down and I can't buy because  I got no money.** 

2. **Maximum 20% allocation on any stock.** 

3. **When I think about “Should I get out” is the right time to get out.** 

4. **Get out when you have achieved your target and take re-entry after 4 weeks minimum ----&gt; Locking profits** 

5. **Don’t buy in rush**. Observe and then take entry at good price. Stocks always gives a chance. Buy in 2 different stage. 50% + 50% 

6. **Don’t buy any stock that I will not hold for long.** Buy 50% of allocated capital (20%); when I buy and it goes deep down, buy the rest 50%. 

7. **Don’t fall in love with a stock**. 

8. **Don’t panic sell**; Never ever if you have high conviction on your stock selection. Those always came back and went even higher. 

9. **Once account gets bigger--- buy 50% index fund, 30% cash and 20% risky stocks** for high growth. 

10. Down trend Cycles in 2020 – September 3rd, 2.5 weeks before election Oct 2nd, from 2nd week of December. Cycles in 2021 --- Sell February 20th to re-entry March 8th , Sell March 16th to Re-entry March 25th , sell April 6th to re-entry April 20th, Sell April 28th to re-entry May 13, Sell June 17 to re-entry July 16th. **So, you see, there are lot of clear re-entry point.** It is hard to time the sell but need to sell when I’ve a descent profit and have a feeling time is getting bad. 

11. Long term secured big gains are possible only from blue stocks, established growth stocks and index funds/ ETFs**. Risky stocks are not for long term secured gains. So follow 80%/20% rule.**  

12. NO SHORT CUT

13. Payoff margin as soon as you have gains and can afford paying off. 

14. **Look at trading plan on regular interval and always follow, if you break blame yourself onlyyyyyyyyyyyy--&gt; So Never break**

stocks,"Premarket/post market explained (to the best of my ability) Disclaimer: I'm not a pro trader/investor; this is not a financial advice. 

I see a lot of people here being confused about pre-/post market. Allow me to explain. I was able to do so in the past and I hope it works this time as well. English is not my first language but I'll be using simple terms a kid would understand. I think it's what works best. 

Imagine you want to buy some fish. You come to a fish market before it opens. You've written a price you are willing to buy fish at on a cardboard. This is your bid. You see a few people gathered at the gate. Some of them are buyers like you with their cardboards. And some are selling fish and you can see their price tags on display - that's their ask price. You can also see a market price which is a price at which a trade happened. A trade is when a person who buys fish finds a person who sells fish at a matched price. For it to happen someone will have to give in. Negotiations happen. 

You look around and you don't see a price that satisfies you. You know that once the market opens you'll see how much fish is available for sale. If there is a lot of fish -&gt; the price will inevitably go down. If there is a shortage in fish -&gt; the price will inevitably go down. Before gates open you can't know how much fish will be on the market. You can only speculate. People at the gate might know more than you do or they might only appear like they know more than you do. Some of them think there will be a lot of fish, so they lower their prices much lower than the market price from yesterday. Sometimes they are right, sometimes they are wrong. Almost no one knows for sure how much fish will be for sale today.

As gates open up and everyone flocks inside you now see the actual picture. You see how much fish is being sold and how many people are willing to buy it. It is all about the demand - are more people willing to buy or are there more people willing to sell? Now it's time for buyers to meet sellers. People negotiate and thus move the market price higher or lower. If people know that the storm is coming and there will be a shortage of fish, it will be known before market opens up, so even those who showed up to a closed gate will know that the price will go higher and continue going higher by the end of the day. But on most days no one can know for sure how much fish will be brought in and how many people will want to buy it.

So here you have it. You don't know if those early birds are correct. They don't set the mood, nor they can confirm how much fish is going to be sold and bought that day. You see how those few people move the price for them, not for everyone involved. Therefore it's best to wait until the gates open and you can make a better judgement of what's going on. Better but still not perfect, because buyers and sellers come and go. Lunch time is typically slow, while by the end of the day people begin to have a better idea about how much fish is (still) available, so it picks up again. Sometimes there is a momentum when a lot of people are wrong - this is when you see a quick rise and fall. Or the amount of fish will fluctuate as more boats come in. 

Personally I try not to let premarket or post market prices affect me mentally. I don't get too upset if the price is suddenly 10% down from yesterday at a premarket, not do I get too excited if I see a price going 10% up after the market closes. Those prices are not a real reflection of the market. They only represent what happens outside the gate, among a few people. All that price means is what ""they"" were able to agree on. I wait for more ""players"" and more information to really show me what's going on. 

If you want to watch this in real life so to speak look at $MTN for example. You will see a huge gap between bid and ask prices at premarket. Wait until the bell and watch what happens. Bids and asks will begin to change, indicating who is giving in and who is gaining strength. Once a trade happens you will see a market price 

I hope this helps some of you understand what happens. This is just a tip of an iceberg and a very exaggerated simplification. But this should give you an idea of what you actually see during those hours. Feel free to ask questions or correct me when there is a need."

stocks,"Why investing in $CRTD is a no-brainer at this price (Squeeze inbound) **The Rundown (sources at the bottom):**

* 49.72% Short Interest
* Now the #1 most shorted stock (Not sure why [highintereststocks.com](https://highintereststocks.com/) has yet to list it. If someone knows, let me know)
* $38mil - $50mil market cap (For reference, GME and AMC are both in the billions)
* Closed today at $3.18

**Here's why I bought the dip today:**

The fact that it's now the #1 most shorted stock will certainly draw attention from the media and retail investors. If it was #4 or #5, I would be more on the fence. But being #1 comes with a spotlight.

Moreover, its very low price is also enticing to retail investors and its low market cap allows for immense volatility. We've seen how it's gone from roughly $3 to $7 in a single day. And now, it's currently trading at $3.18.

Considering that CRTD has a floor around $2.50 - $3 that it has pretty much never fallen through, it is a safe bet to buy in around this price. Then, factor in that it's the #1 most shorted stock and has a very low market cap, and you have what amounts to a short squeeze (a.k.a. the next CARV). All we need is some volume. That's why I'm here.

The company is obviously young and not profitable, hence why it is shorted. So there are, of course, some concerns that they could go under and investors would lose their entire investment. They acknowledge this in the most recent [10-K report](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001357671/000121390021018972/f10k2020_creatdinc.htm), but they also explain that they expect to ""have adequate financing for the next 12 months."" And with the [recent press release](https://www.nasdaq.com/press-release/creatd-inc.-hits-key-milestone-of-over-30000-vocal-subscribers-and-confirms-revenue) that touts an increase in revenue and a decrease in costs, they are not going under anytime soon (""soon"" meaning within the next month, at least, which is all the time we need for a squeeze anyway).

I am not an expert. I am not a financial adviser. But too many things are lining up for this shit to pop, and with how low the price is, y'all can make bank.

I ain't no bullshit artist, so let me know if any of this information is incorrect. I appreciate the advice.

Then, not only do they have a good dividend yield of almost 3%, they are also aggressively buying back shares. lastly, HPQ has a P/S of about 0.5 which makes sense because of the low profit margin but that's still extremely low.

My initial reaction was that a short term play would be buying shares of it right now and then selling it after its inclusion date for quick gains. The rationale behind this is that there is greater buying pressure from hedge funds and ETFs that track the S&amp;P 500 since they need to buy shares of the stock as the inclusion date approaches.

# **Earnings could be the biggest driver for markets in the week ahead as investors watch bonds - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/16/earnings-could-be-the-biggest-driver-for-markets-in-the-week-ahead-as-investors-watch-bonds.html)**
*****
&gt; Stocks enter a busy week for earnings news with two perplexing questions hanging over the market.
*****
&gt; One is whether the big gains in corporate profits will start to boost stocks with solid earnings reports. That was not the case for some financial sector stocks this past week. The other question is whether the surprise decline in the 10-year Treasury note yield is sending a message that stock investors should heed.
*****
&gt; The benchmark 10-year yield, which moves opposite price, was at 1.30% Friday, after dipping below that level on Thursday. Stock indexes slipped for the week, with the S&amp;P 500 down nearly 1% and the Dow down about 0.5% for the week. The Nasdaq, which has typically benefited from lower yields, was off by more than 1.9% for the week.
*****
&gt; Stocks had a rocky day Friday, selling off into the closing bell. Defensive sectors, like health care, consumer staples and utilities gained in the session, while cyclicals, like energy and materials were hit hard.
*****
&gt; Airlines, railroads, drug companies and tech are among the many industries reporting results in the week ahead. Netflix reports Tuesday, while Johnson &amp; Johnson, Coca-Cola, and Verizon issue results on Wednesday. Intel and AT&amp;T report Thursday. American Express and Honeywell release quarterly earnings Friday.
*****
&gt; “Earnings have the spotlight in the coming week,” said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. “You’re not going to see economic data upstage earnings.”
*****
&gt; # Data takes a backseat to earnings
&gt; Among the handful of economic reports are housing starts Tuesday and existing home sales Thursday.
*****
&gt; Stovall said he is watching earnings report to see if stocks rally or languish after results. He said earnings for the S&amp;P 500 companies are now expected to be up more than 66% for the quarter.
*****
&gt; “I think what it means is investors are looking at this quarter as a peak quarter in the earnings cycle,” he said. “We’re getting what analysts had expected and then some, but because we are now on the leeward side of the earnings cycle, I think investors are probably going to be taking some profits because their expectations have been met and will not be exceeded in coming quarters.”
*****
&gt; James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at The Leuthold Group, said earnings may be more of a factor for stocks in the much quieter week ahead. In the past week, the market focus was on two days of testimony from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and important data, like the consumer price index and retail sales.
*****
&gt; # Bonds are in the spotlight
&gt; “I think the biggest issue is still going to be the 10-year bond yield,” Paulsen said. He said the key will be whether the 10-year yield falls back to its recent low of 1.25% or breaks above the important 1.4% level.
*****
&gt; “I think the continued drop in the bond yield is scaring investors overall — but particularly equity investors,” said Paulsen. The falling 10-year yield has recently been viewed favorably because lower interest rates are positive for tech and growth stocks. But the yield is now getting attention for continuing to move lower, contrary to the reflation trade and defying forecasts for higher yields.
*****
&gt; Bond strategists have been surprised by the decline, which they blame on a variety of factors. One is a massive repositioning by investors who were short the longer duration Treasury issues and were betting on higher yields. Another reason is there is less new issuance than expected from the Treasury.
*****
&gt; But there are also troubling worries about the economy.
*****
&gt; “What the heck is it telling us? The fears are it’s giving a better read on Covid and maybe a coming slowdown. Growth is good, while it’s not going to be near as good as people thought,” said Paulsen. One worrisome scenario factoring into the lower yields is that the Fed may be forced to tighten policy sooner than expected because of hot inflation, and that could slow the economy.
*****
&gt; Stovall said there’s a chance the bond market is sending a warning for stocks, and it is acting as a canary in a coal mine. But he also sees the yield reversing and moving higher.
*****
&gt; “Our belief is it will move higher by the end of the year, and economic growth will be strong,” he said. “I think the market will continue to watch that because interest rates are so crucial to intrinsic value models and it’s also doing what most people did not expect it to do.”

&gt; # Main Street Sentiment Remains Strong Despite Risks from Speedy Recovery

&gt; Sentiment on Main Street remains strong as the U.S. economy continues to move towards normalcy, but concerns about the impact of a strong but uneven recovery are rising as higher prices, supply chain bottlenecks, and trouble finding qualified workers weigh on businesses’ ability to expand.

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, Main Street sentiment is at its second highest level in over a decade according to LPL Research’s proprietary Beige Book Barometer (BBB), topped only by the June 2021 BBB reading. The result is based on our analysis of the Federal Reserve’s (Fed) Beige Book, a publication released two weeks before each Fed policy meeting that captures qualitative observations made by community bankers and business owners—what we like to think of as “Main Street” rather than “Wall Street.” The BBB gauges sentiment by looking at how frequently key words and phrases appear in the text.

&gt; In the most recent Beige Book, “strong” words had declined slightly while “weak” words fell to their lowest level since the BBB’s inception in 2005. However, expressions of uncertainty had increased and the report did note broad-based pricing pressures. Our sub-index of inflation-related words in the Beige Book remained at its highest level since we created the inflation sub-index in 2015.

&gt; “The economy is picking up speed but has not yet returned to pre-pandemic levels,” said LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “We expect the return to normalcy to continue to support economic growth, but the speed of the recovery also comes with some hazards.” (For more on LPL Research’s economic outlook and its potential impact on markets, see its recently released Midyear Outlook 2021: Picking Up Speed ).

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/7.16.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Mentions of COVID-related words (virus, COVID, pandemic) continued to fall in the most recent Beige Book, as they have in every Beige Book since January, even falling below the level of their initial appearance in March 2020. More concerning, in addition to the persistence of inflation-related words, supply chains also received frequent mention and mentions of shortages remained elevated. The downside of the economy’s rapid acceleration has been a mismatch between demand, which can ramp up quickly, and supply, which comes on line more slowly, while labor markets have also been slow to keep pace with reopening.

&gt; Nevertheless, the fundamental backdrop for the economy remains positive. Upside risks from inflation and disruptions from the Delta COVID variant are on-going risks, but we continue to expect inflation to start to subside as the economy normalizes. Global vaccine distribution will help limit the impact of the Delta variant, although it has led to some new restrictions. US economic acceleration will probably peak in the second quarter, but there’s still plenty of scope for growth to moderate and still remain above average. Much of the positive news is already priced in for equity markets, which are forward looking, and gains may not come as easily, but we still see solid potential for upside as the economy continues to rebound and potentially gains additional support from an improving global economy.

&gt; # A Check-In on Inflation

&gt; This week has provided investors with a fresh batch of data carrying the potential to heavily affect the inflation debate. Tuesday brought us the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for June, while Wednesday saw the release of the Producer Price Index (PPI) for June as well as the start of Federal Reserve (Fed) Chair Jerome Powell’s two-day testimony to Congress providing an update on the economy.

&gt; So has any of this materially changed our view (or the Fed’s) on the great inflation debate? Not really.

&gt; This may surprise some given CPI’s and PPI’s large beats relative to expectations, but at least for the next few months we believe that the composition of the inflationary increases is more important than the headline numbers. Headline CPI jumped 0.9% month over month vs. estimates of 0.5%, while core CPI jumped 0.9% month over month vs. estimates of 0.4%. Base effects from rolling off weak numbers a year earlier meant the year-over-year numbers were even more eye-popping. Meanwhile, headline and core PPI both rose 1.0% month over month vs. expectations for 0.5%. Under the hood, though, the theme of both reports is quicker-than-anticipated reopenings are stretching supply chains. The good news there is that those supply chain dynamics have the potential to improve quickly to meet demand and mitigate the lasting effects.

&gt; This is especially true in the auto, travel, hospitality, and food industries. Semiconductor shortages, which are already showing signs of subsiding, are driving shortages in both the new and used car marketplaces. As rental car companies increase their fleets to meet demand, they are increasingly being forced to bid up a limited amount of existing supply. Similarly, labor supply shortages in the leisure and hospitality sector, as well as airline travel, are restricting supply and causing prices to skyrocket. These components all tend to be relatively small parts of the overall CPI basket, but at the moment they are driving an outsized degree of the volatility.

&gt; All of these phenomena can be described as supply chain bottlenecks, which should eventually resolve themselves. For example, the elimination of supplemental unemployment benefits in September should help increase the supply of labor. Rent prices, though, have a greater impact on overall CPI as they account for 41% of the basket, and increases tend to have greater staying power. While they have risen slightly, they are still under control by historical standards, and play a major part in informing our view that inflation will eventually prove to be transitory.

&gt; Fed Chair Powell’s testimony did not break any new ground on the debate either. While the market did perk its ears up when Powell mentioned that the committee is in “active consideration” over when to begin tapering asset purchases, his characterization of inflation as being mainly transitory and affected by supply chain bottlenecks remained steadfast.

&gt; “The composition of recent data suggests that inflation will largely prove transitory as the Fed has stated,” said LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Just how long ‘transitory’ will prove to be is the big question. We are in the middle of the season when we expected to see some hot prints, so this week has not necessarily been a surprise. But with each passing report market participants will be increasingly anxious to see those numbers start to moderate.”

&gt; What is market pricing telling us about inflation? As seen in the LPL Chart of the Day, the market seems to be largely buying into the Fed’s narrative of transitory elevated inflation so far.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/7.16.21-Blog-2-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Breakeven inflation rates, market-based measures of inflation expectations over given timeframes, rose steadily until roughly the release of the April CPI report when we started hearing about peak inflation concerns. Though that report beat consensus estimates, the subsequent drop in both 5- and 10-year breakevens suggests the market accepted the Fed’s characterization of inflation as transitory.

&gt; And while the levels of these series can be volatile, we believe the divergence that began around the New Year is telling. 5-year breakevens began outpacing 10-year breakevens, suggesting that inflation may run hotter in the near-to-intermediate term, but that the market still has faith in the Fed to keep long-term inflation under control. 5-years making a new local high in the last week without 10-years following suit suggests that while the market is slightly concerned that transitory may prove to be longer than originally thought, it does not believe it will cause concerns on a longer horizon.

&gt; Rents and wages continue to be areas we monitor as tells on whether inflation may be “stickier” than the market anticipates. Our next good look into wage pressure comes on July 30 when we will receive the second quarter Employment Cost Index (ECI) from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. This report is important because it keeps the jobs mix it looks at constant. If there is wage pressure it may not show up in average earnings data if the job mix is shifting to lower wage jobs, as we likely have now, but the ECI would capture it.

&gt; # S&amp;P 500 Equalweight Lagging Badly

&gt; If you've been following the market over the last couple of months, you've likely noticed that the ""mega-cap"" stocks have been the main driver of the broad market's move higher. You can really see this trend when looking at the performance disparity between the cap-weighted S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and the equal-weight S&amp;P 500 (RSP). (Just to be clear, the main S&amp;P 500 index that's tracked closely across the investment landscape is a cap-weighted index, meaning larger stocks have a bigger impact on its performance than smaller stocks. The lesser-followed equal-weight S&amp;P 500 weights all 500 stocks in the index equally. In the equal-weight S&amp;P 500, Apple (AAPL) -- the largest stock in the index -- and Unum Group (UNM) -- the smallest stock in the index -- have the exact same impact on the index's performance.)

&gt; Yesterday was once again a bad day for most stocks as the equal-weight S&amp;P 500 (RSP) fell more than 0.90% on the day. At the same time, the cap-weighted S&amp;P 500 actually closed slightly higher on the day. As shown below, RSP has been stuck in a sideways pattern for the past two months, essentially going nowhere. SPY, on the other hand, has experienced a nice leg higher and is now very extended above its 50-day moving average. Over the last 12 trading days, SPY has closed at a new high 8 times while RSP has averaged a daily move of -0.02%. While the mega-cap growth stocks spent the time from late 2020 through early 2021 in consolidation, it's not the smaller cap stocks in the index that look to have fallen asleep.

&gt; While RSP has been trading sideways for the past couple of months, it's actually still slightly ahead of SPY on a year-to-date basis.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/07/rspspyytdchg.png))**

&gt; As shown below, RSP's YTD lead over SPY has been declining rapidly since peaking in May/June, however.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/07/rspspyytd.png))**

&gt; It's the last two months that have caused RSP to give up nearly all of its 2021 outperformance versus SPY. As shown below, RSP is only up 0.33% over the last two months, while SPY is up 4.64%.

&gt; The recent underperformance we've seen from RSP is definitely outside the norm. Below we show the rolling 2-month performance spread between RSP and SPY since RSP began trading in 2003. There have only been two other periods where we've seen the 2-month performance spread turn more negative for the equal-weight S&amp;P versus the cap-weighted S&amp;P. The first was in late October/November 2008 when the entire market was falling rapidly during the Financial Crisis. The second was in late March 2020 during the COVID Crash. These two examples show that we normally see RSP significantly underperform SPY like this when the broad market is falling; not when it's rallying to record highs on a seemingly daily basis.

&gt; # Fewer Bulls Without More Bears

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 is flat on the week but the index did tag record highs on Monday. In spite of this, sentiment has turned lower as the AAII survey showed bullish sentiment fall four percentage points to 36.2% this week. That took out the low of 36.4% from the week of May 27th to make for the lowest reading since the last week of October.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/07/071521-AAII-Bull.png))**

&gt; Some of those declines were picked up by bearish sentiment which rose to 26.8% from 24.5%. Whereas bullish sentiment is at one of the lowest levels in months, that is only the highest level in bearish sentiment since May 13th.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/07/071521-AAII-Bear.png))**

&gt; With bearish sentiment having risen only slightly while bullish sentiment experiences a more significant decline, the bull-bear spread has fallen to 9.4. That is at the low end of the past several months' range.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/07/071521-AAII-Bull-Bear.png))**

&gt; Instead, the losses to bullish sentiment have been picked up by the neutral sentiment camp as this week's reading topped 37%. While late May and early June saw similar to slightly higher readings, that level of neutral sentiment is elevated relative to the historical average of 31.43%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/07/071521-AAII-Neutral.png))**

&gt; Overall, the AAII survey has shown individual investors have become increasingly less optimistic, albeit not outright bearish, over the past few weeks. And while that may be the case for this group, equity newsletter writers have been another story. The sentiment survey from Investors Intelligence (II) covering this section of the market participantshas maintained a more optimistic outlook. This week, 61.2% of respondents reported as bullish which is the highest reading since April. That also comes in the top 5% of all readings since the start of the survey in the early 1960s.

&gt; In the chart below, we show the spread in the bullish sentiment readings of the AAII and Investors Intelligence surveys. This week, that spread fell down to -25 (meaning the percentage of respondents reporting as bullish in the AAII survey is 25 points lower than in the Investors Intelligence survey). That is the lowest reading in the spread since October and it is also in the bottom 5% of all periods.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/07/071521-AAII-II-Spread.png))**

&gt; There have been 20 times in which the spread has dipped below -25 without having done so in the prior six months. As shown, these instances are not particularly rare with about a year or two between each one. But what is notable about the current instance is how elevated the bullish sentiment readings are for each survey. As for what this means for the performance of the S&amp;P 500, in the near term performance has tended to have a negative bias, but moves higher are much more consistently seen in the months to a year after.

stocks,"19YRS OLD - Portfolio plans \------------------------------Goals------------------------------------------

Invest 4k/year in order to buy a house at 30 - 50% deposit using lifetime ISA as soon as possible, have the first 12k ready now. Planning on getting a house worth around 140k. (I am from the UK). Another 2-4k will be invested in a regular stocks and shares ISA depending on how much I save up that year.

Will take money out in 5 - 8 years.

\----------------------------Portfolio Plan:-------------------------------

50% iShares MSCI

20% QQQ

15%  Vanguard Japan Acc (I just love Japan, anime/games/arcades/food, so I want to be invested)

15% Stocks I choose/companies I want to support/own , e.g. Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Nintendo etc

&amp;#x200B;

If someone could give advice/modifications that would help me reach my goal, I would be very grateful. The ETFs/Stocks must be available on AJ Bell Your Invest as it is what I use for my Lifetime ISA. I can open an regular ISA elsewhere though after maxing my Lifetime one (4k) as AJ bell doesn't have some ETFs like the VT/VTI that is often talked about."
stocks,"Where to find analyst projected free cash flow for specific companies? Title. I'm pretty new to investing and I want to start doing some DCF's using analyst estimates ( I don't trust myself quite yet to accurately project future FCF), but I can't seem to find them anywhere. Anyone know where I can find analyst estimates online?"
stocks,"How do you sell stock you just purchased without selling the same stock you bought at a lower price? Confusing title I know but I'll try to explain better.

I've been buying GME at various points in time @ 40, 130, 200, ext and my average was at 170. I've been following it for a while now and saw some opportunity to make some money day trading it since it has been so volatile. 

In total, I have 180 GME. A couple of weeks ago I bought 50 @ 200 and sold 50 @ 210\~220 and I did this couple of times.  So fast forward now, GME has dipped down and now I see my average is well above 170 and now I am down a couple of grand instead of breaking even right now (plus the profit I should have made). I see now, when I sold, it sold my stock I bought @ 40 instead of when I bought at 200. 

Hopefully, this makes sense. So is there a way to sell stocks you just recently bought instead of increasing your average? I use Charles Schwab btw."
stocks,"What is the deal with SGOC? This last week it goes from $2 to $9 to $20 back to $9 up to $13... Opens at $14 today, tanks down to ~$10.5, closes at $12.40 and is now running hard after hours. This is bouncing around like mad and I don't understand why. 

Is this some elaborate pump and dump? Seems like there's big money to be made if you play the swings right. Thoughts?"
stocks,"Why are trading volumes so low for individuals stocks? This isn't a question about that other asset wit the orange logo. Auto bot removed me for that. 

Hello all. I come from a non-stock asset/currency background (you know what I mean). I know little about stocks. I noticed that the average daily volume for AAPL is around 80 million USD [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/key-statistics?p=AAPL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/key-statistics?p=AAPL)

Why is it so low compared to the orange logo coin background? Am I reading this wrong? They have relatively similar caps.

Please don't speak about the orange logo thing in your post because I dont want this post removed. I just want to know why these stocks have such low volume considering their massive market caps."
stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Friday, July 16, 2021 **PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, July 16, 2021**

Volatility in the markets continued today, with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) falling for the third consecutive day after recording new intraday highs earlier in the week. The Dow Jones (DIA) also fell while the Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, continued its streak of underperformance, pulling back more than 1% for the fourth consecutive day. Market participants continue to digest Q2 earning reports, mixed economic data regarding inflation, and commentary by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. 

Ever since the release of the June Consumer and Producer Price Indexes (CPI &amp; PPI), which showed price inflation growing at a higher than expected clip, the market has become increasingly volatile, which is not super surprising given the SPY and QQQ have been on a remarkable rally as of late. The CPI, which measures changes in the prices of consumer goods, rose 0.9% in June, accelerating from May’s 0.6%. Year-on-year, the CPI is up 5.4%, exceeding the 4.9% expected by economists and the fastest rate of growth since 2008. Core CPI, which excludes the volatile price energy and food and is therefore considered a more accurate representation of general price inflation, was up 4.5% year-on-year as prices bounced from last year’s pandemic-era lows. PPI, which measures the average changes in prices received by domestic producers for their output rose 1% in June, accelerating to a 7.3% rise year-on-year, while still reflecting base effects. Core PPI rose 5.5%. This is the fastest rate of increase since 2009.

On a positive note, according to a report by the Department of Commerce, retail sales in the US unexpectedly increased in June, despite massive supply-side constraints affecting a swath of consumer goods, most notably, vehicles. The report showed spending was increasingly shifting back to services, like travel and entertainment, an encouraging sign that the reopening of the economy is going fairly well. Retail sales rose 0.6% in June, better than the decline of 0.4% expected by economists. Retail sales in the US are up 18% from June 2020, reflecting base effects as the economy continues to rebound from the pandemic-induced recession. 

Mike Loewengart, Managing Director of Investment Strategy at E-Trade Financial said, “*""*The unexpected rise in retail sales combined with yesterday’s pandemic-era low of jobless claims are two more strong proof points that we are edging closer to a full economic recovery. While we are seeing consumers broadly look more towards services and activities, the expectations that people would be turning away from goods seems to have been a little overblown.""

Earlier this week, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell gave his semi-annual monetary policy testimony before Congress, where he largely reiterated the same thing he has been saying for months. Powell said “inflation will likely remain elevated in the coming months before moderating” and that the US economy was “still a ways” off from reaching the threshold of “substantial further progress” that would trigger the Central Bank to roll-back pandemic-era policies. In short, Powell basically said while he expects higher inflation prints in the coming months, pressures are transitory and due to pandemic era disruptions and the Fed’s goal for economic recovery have not been met. [Here is Powell’s complete testimony, but here are two of his most important quotes.](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/testimony/powell20210714a.htm)

**On the labor market:** “Conditions in the labor market have continued to improve, but there is still a long way to go. Labor demand appears to be very strong; job openings are at a record high, hiring is robust, and many workers are leaving their current jobs to search for better ones. Indeed, employers added 1.7 million workers from April through June. However, the unemployment rate remained elevated in June at 5.9 percent, and this figure understates the shortfall in employment, particularly as participation in the labor market has not moved up from the low rates that have prevailed for most of the past year. Job gains should be strong in coming months as public health conditions continue to improve and as some of the other pandemic-related factors currently weighing them down diminish.”

**On inflation:** “Inflation has increased notably and will likely remain elevated in coming months before moderating. Inflation is being temporarily boosted by base effects, as the sharp pandemic-related price declines from last spring drop out of the 12-month calculation. In addition, strong demand in sectors where production bottlenecks or other supply constraints have limited production has led to especially rapid price increases for some goods and services, which should partially reverse as the effects of the bottlenecks unwind. Prices for services that were hard hit by the pandemic have also jumped in recent months as demand for these services has surged with the reopening of the economy”.

**Highlights**

* Ford Motors (F) issued three safety recalls affecting more than 800,000 in response to six injury allegations stemming from issues with the “rear suspension toe link which significantly diminishes steering control, increasing the risk of a crash.”
* Twitter (TWTR) and Square (SQ) CEO Jack Dorsey said SQ is launching a business dedicated to “decentralized financial services”. Through Twitter Dorsey said the company is “focused on building an open developer platform with the sole goal of making it easy to create non-custodial, permissionless, and decentralized financial services.”
* Tesla (TSLA) vehicle registrations in California rose more than 85% in the second quarter versus last year, largely due to the success of the company's Model Y, according to data from research firm Cross-Sell
* Import prices were up 1% in June over May, adding to a 1.4% increase the month prior. This marks the eighth straight month import prices have risen and brings the annual price increase to 11.2%
* Netflix (NFLX) has announced it plans to eventually stream video games on its platform and hired a former Electronic Arts (EA) executive to lead the push. 
* As earnings season continues, big bank stocks continue falling despite, in most cases, posting great earnings. 
* Microsoft (MSFT) is betting hybrid work will provide an opening to make its Windows operating system more widespread, launching a new service aimed at getting users of Apple (AAPL) and Android products to use the software. Windows 365, the company said, will be accessible on any device running any operating system that has a web browser, such as Apple Mac computers, iPhones and iPads, or those running Android software made by Alphabet (GOOGL)

stocks,"Metals funds that cycle in value Ok here goes, I had a landlord who invests in a fund that is exclusively for metals and he swears it periodically goes up &amp; down in value on a regular basis, such as several times a year. Obviously he takes his profit and then reinvests. 

I never quizzed him on the fund, so would anyone here know of similar funds in metals?

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you."
stocks,"How do you think COMAC will affect aircraft manufacturers like Boeing and Airbus? So, Boeing is currently trading at $218, and I was planning to get in anywhere below $225. The price seems like a good deal given that Boeing has plenty of outstanding orders, and that Boeing is also part of the duopoly that is the global aircraft manufacturing industry. They also have their defence division, which I think is a good safety net for them, I believe the US relies on them quite a lot.

Of course, their safety record is called into question slightly, but I feel that they’ve learnt from the 737 MAX. Boeing continues to have a good safety record, and continues to be dominant in the airline industry.

My one and only big concern is COMAC. I can almost guarantee to you that the CCP will push Chinese airlines to use COMAC aircraft. We don’t know how big COMAC can become in the future, but my first impressions of the company are very poor. Firstly, I can never see the US allowing anything of that sort into their airspace, or even getting FAA approval to start with. Secondly, COMAC looks like complete joke right now. They don’t even have a secure website, so the whole thing seems like a big fantasy project from China to try and compete with larger aircraft manufacturers.

However, everyone laughs at a company until it actually starts doing well. People laughed at Mark Zuckerberg’s idea, and now look where we are.

Any thoughts?"
stocks,"What to add? So oil is going down this week. If Next week its going down more i could average down. Biggest positions SU and RDS, BP. I AM looking to ADD BP becouse better price for me and less invested, 25% portfolio is rds so probably dont want to add more. Also BP dividend is the best, looking to add maybe Exxon if price is under 55. What you guys think?

P.s what stocks you are bullish on? Also outside oil, actually i would like to add out of oil."

stocks,"Insurance stocks and climate change I am planning on buying some insurance stocks (RNR, RE) . But I am unsure about the long term future for the insurance industry. More specific, I am worried that climate change related catastrophes will just become worse and more frequent, and this will ofcourse put the insurance industry to test. Therfore, I am starting to worry that buying insurance stocks might not be as safe as I tought. 

What do you guys think?

How should the insurance companies deal with this? Should they raise the premium cost in order to stay profitable? And if so, how will the customers react?

Basicly I want to start some discussion about the future of the insurance industry. All toughts are welcome. 😀"

It’s obviously not a 100% accurate and doesn’t determine anything but I’d like to get alerts for either unusual options alert or an alert for when a stock changes by a certain price (say JPM alert every 50¢) thank you for your time!

stocks,"Intel Potential I  think we all know that demand for chips is very high given the  shortages, we also know Intel is soon to unveil an architecture more  similar to AMD's chiplet design, which will solve a lot of their yield  problems.  They are entering the GPU market as well where valuations are  ridiculous, and markets like self driving cars.

Its  currently valued at around 12x earnings, and demand is still going up for x86 despite current shortages.  Is it simply a guarantee that Intel does well in the future?  I think as a value stock it currently seems quite safe for the next decade, while maintaining a huge potential in  the short term.

What do you guys  think, is it a no brainer?  Could it ever become valued at less than 12x  earnings given they are soon to alleviate many of their yield issues?"
stocks,"A question for employees of public companies I want to know what you think go your CEO and other upper management, and what company you work for.  

I recently did some research on a company and found high approval ratings that did not seem to accurately reflect what any readers who were employed by the company thought.  Because of this, I would like to get some reviews on CEOs, and compare them to what I can find on places like glass door. If I get enough responses I will make a post that compares online CEO ratings to what employees actually think."
stocks,"Wash sale question I have a question about wash sales. I own a stock that’s currently at a loss. It’s been trending down for the last couple of months and I sold some covered calls. The covered calls are likely to exercise today and I’d be forced to sell my shares at a loss. If I turn around and re-buy them I know I can’t claim the loss as a loss on taxes. Does that mean that the loss can never be claimed or does it just get automatically rolled back into my repurchase cost basis?. So if I bought the stock back on Monday and held it and sold it six months from now still at a loss would I be able to claim the loss is then, or just the new losses from now till then?

I’m not looking for tax advice I’m just trying to understand wash sales for an American investor. Google explains it well but not quite well enough to answer my question."
stocks,Chlorine companies I was talking to a friend who told me chlorine prices have been going up quite a bit after a plant in Louisiana had a large fire. That leads me to a question: What are some of the best chlorine companies with the best outlooks?

After a year of heavy losses buying at the top of every stock on a run up, I decided to only buy after a good dip. I watched the dip from $28 to under $22. And saw what I thought was a good buying opportunity. Literally a week later I suffer a 10% on a company that is not only profitable, but hasn't released any news? What is going on here?"

stocks,"Postal Realty Trust (NYSE: PSTL) Postal Realty Trust (NYSE: PSTL), a REIT, calls itself the nation’s largest owner and manager of properties leased to the United States Postal Service (USPS) with 852 owned properties and 399 managed properties totaling 3.6 million owned square feet and 1.7 million managed square feet. As of the end of Q1-21, PSTL’s owned portfolio was 100% occupied.

PSTL leases its properties nearly **exclusively** to the USPS with most leases being modified double-net leases, whereby the tenant (USPS) is responsible for utilities, routine maintenance, and the reimbursement of property taxes and the landlord (PSTL) is responsible for insurance, roof, and structure.

PSTL’s owned portfolio is split across last mile (&lt; 2,500 SF), flex (2,500 – 5,000 SF), and industrial (&gt; 50,000 SF) and as of May 4, 2021, split as a percentage of SF 19.8%, 50.8%, and 29.4%, respectively. At yesterday’s (July 15) close of $18.65/share, PSTL had an enterprise value of $399 million, including $98 million in debt and $4 million in cash (using Q1-21 balance sheet items).

**HERE’S WHY I LIKE THE STOCK**

* Q1-21 property net operating income (NOI) of $6.9 million (annualized to $27.6 million) translates to a 6.9% cap rate
* Q1-21 AFFO of $4.3 million (annualized to $17.2 million) translates to a 17.9x P/AFFO multiple
* Dividend yield of 4.7%
* Loan to value of 23%

Compare the above to another government-only REIT – Easterly Government Properties (NYSE: DEA). While DEA has exposure to more than just one government agency, they are trading at a 6.0% cap rate, 18.1x P/AFFO multiple, 4.7% dividend yield, and 32.9% loan to value.

While this may not seem like PSTL has **too much** room to run, consider a sum of the parts on their owned portfolio. We all know that the industrial sector has been on a tear recently and is the next big thing since sliced bread because of COVID and e-commerce acceleration, etc. PSTL’s 1.0 million square feet of industrial assets produced $4.5 million in annualized rent as of May 4, 2021. I’ll assume that this portion of the portfolio is triple-net (i.e., $4.5 million annualized rent = $4.5 million NOI) since that is how industrial properties tend to lease. Industrial REIT comps trade at an average 4.2% cap rate (note: the largest comp Prologis trades at 2.7%!), meaning the industrial portfolio within PSTL should be worth about $107 million.

Back to sum of the parts: considering the above, at yesterday’s price, you’re buying the rest of the PSTL portfolio of last mile and flex properties totaling 2.6 million square feet and generating $23.1 million NOI for $292 million or a **7.9% cap rate.** If this were valued at the same 6.0% cap as DEA, that is an **upside to PSTL of 30%.**

Some other great points – PSTL was just included in the Russell 2000 and management seems to be **extremely** invested. The CEO, Andrew Spodek, has been investing in USPS properties for 20 years and sits on the board of directors of the Association of United States Postal Lessors. Spodek is the largest individual investor owning 5.8% of the company. He also personally guarantees almost $3 million in PSTL’s indebtedness.

**RISKS**

I fully understand that PSTL’s single-tenant exposure is a risk. I understand that PSTL’s weighted average lease term remaining being only 4 years further compounds that risk. However, consider this:

* USPS made 100% of rent payments on time throughout the COVID-19 pandemic
* PSTL historic lease retention rate (going back to 2011) has been 98.4%
* USPS lease payments in fiscal year 2020 totaled approximately $1.4 billion, representing only 1.7% of the USPS’s total operating expenses so cost cutting programs at the USPS are unlikely to look at real estate first

I also don’t love that the majority of PSTL leases are double-net instead of triple-net.

The dividend AFFO payout ratio is also rather high at 84% so there’s not much room for the dividend to increase barring any fundamental changes.

**HERE’S WHY I REALLY LIKE THE STOCK**

Remember how I made a distinction between PSTL owned and managed properties? The 399 managed properties are also USPS-leased properties, but they are owned by the CEO’s family. The managed property count doesn’t seem to be growing so I’m not so worried about conflicts of interest between the CEO’s personal vs. PSTL acquisition pipeline.

PSTL is an internally managed REIT with $10.3 million in annualized general &amp; administrative expenses and 34 employees. This looks bad on its own and begs the question why they don’t move to an externally managed structure since their G&amp;A is almost 1/3rd of gross rent collections – way more than an external manager would charge (3-5% of collections). PSTL’s double-net lease structure does not justify this. While double-net requires more management than triple-net, consider that PSTL only had $372,000 in capital improvements in Q1 so it’s not like they’re busy round-the-clock managing construction projects.

Obviously, part of the G&amp;A can be allocated to the managed portfolio, but PSTL only collects an annualized $1.5 million in management fees from the CEO’s personal portfolio. This means that PSTL collects $3,750/year/managed property in management fees but spends $10,400/year/owned property on G&amp;A expenses.

While the CEO is heavily invested in PSTL, I do not think he is totally aligned with shareholders’ interests. It seems like *at worst,* he is using PSTL to subsidize his personal portfolio and *at best,* he is OK with a bloated and inefficient corporate structure. Look no further than PSTL’s **very active** Instagram page to see an example of an unnecessary G&amp;A expense. Not even PSTL’s behemoth REIT peers like Prologis, Realty Income, WP Carey have Instagram pages.

*So this sounds pretty terrible. Why do you really like the stock?*

**Because this makes PSTL a perfect take-over candidate for larger industrial or diversified REIT peers or any other institutional real estate investor.**

Where else can an investor acquire a 3.6 million square foot distribution/last mile network of real estate with locations in all 50 states that is 100% occupied and collected 100% of rents through COVID at a near-7 cap? **Nowhere.**

If you don’t want to bet on an acquisition… Remember how I said that PSTL was just included in the Russell 2000? This is giving PSTL a lot more attention. This is bad news for the CEO since more attention = more pressure on performance and more questions about his totally inefficient overhead structure. The top 10 institutional holders in PSTL own over 45% of the company. These institutions see the same numbers we see and must be asking themselves (and management) the same questions we’re asking. This should ultimately – whether there’s an activist campaign or not – create enough pressure on PSTL to fundamentally reshape their overhead structure and unlock significant cash flow for debt paydown, acquisitions, and/or dividend increases.

**This isn’t financial advice. I just like the stock. My position: 800 shares.**

stocks,"Why would an investor not immediately short the VIX index if it went above say 50 or so? VIX is the volatility index and essentially measures the prices of S&amp;P500 options contracts, in an attempt to represent the volatility of the stock market. Volatility generally speaking is increased when stocks tend to fall more quickly as the broader market is normally on a slow uptrend. 

My question is this; historically, the VIX index rises to well above the 50 level in times of recession but always comes back down to earth in a recovery phrase. Is it not just free money to short it at these levels? Is the risk that the brokerage itself will not allow you to hold out until prices inevitably decline back lower? 

And on another note, is a good measurement of an overheated stock market that the amount of VIX shorts being opened is historically high?"

stocks,"DD: The Case For Beazer Homes USA (BZH) The Case For Beazer Homes USA (BZH)

### If you're one of the few who don't believe housing is in a bubble (like me), this is a home builder with an objectively cheap stock who, if able to manage their debt, is poised for a breakout.

**Company Overview**

**Market cap at publishing: $525M**

**Price at publishing: $16.78**

**1-Year Change: +50%**

Beazer Homes builds and sells residential homes in the U.S. They currently build in Arizona, California, Nevada, Texas, Delaware, Indiana, Maryland, Tennessee, Virginia, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina. The 13 states are segmented into three regions: West, East, and Southeast, with the West currently their busiest area. They have been building homes for over 25 years and while they have not, and may never again reach their ridiculous valuations of 2006 during the housing peak, I believe there is certainly a lot of potential here.

**Financials**

Here are some growth highlights from their fiscal 2nd Quarter results taken from their own presentation:

 [https://imgur.com/yEWpctm](https://imgur.com/yEWpctm)

 Some of my own comparisons of YoY growth: 

 [https://imgur.com/Frg4fj2](https://imgur.com/Frg4fj2)

 Big percentage increases across the board as should be expected since we are comparing with Q2 2020 i.e., the quarter that COVID really took hold. Don’t let that fool you though, Beazer Homes performed well YoY compared to the competition as well.

**Comparing the Competition**

Here is a quick growth comparison using the data above using one of the behemoths in the homebuilding sector, Lennar Corp (market cap: $31B)

 [https://imgur.com/uIngUDM](https://imgur.com/uIngUDM)

A lot of positive data to digest here as Beazer Homes holds up well against Lennar especially in FCF where Beazer more than tripled to $101.2M and Lennar actually fell to $93.7M. Keep in mind Beazer Homes has a current market cap of $537M vs. Lennar with a market cap of $31B (56x larger) with less FCF in Q2 2021.

Some more metrics and ratios that I like to use to compare against Lennar (TTM):

 [https://imgur.com/q2fG8zO](https://imgur.com/q2fG8zO)

So Beazer does very well in ROE, FCFM, but the other two metrics (operating margin and debt to equity) are admittedly pretty bad. The operating margin looks a bit better when you compare Beazer Homes to the industry instead of just Lennar. The industry average operating margin is 9.4% and the D/E average ratio is .86 (according to readyratios.com). That’s better but not great, which brings us to the company's weaknesses, Beazer Homes USA has an operating margin issue and a debt issue. If they can effectively tackle these problems which I believe they can, this company - and more importantly their stock price - has a very bright future.

**The Stock, I Like It**

BZH which is currently trading at $16.78 has a market cap of $525M. The stock is up 55% on the year but is still 52% off its 52-week high of $26.12. There is a reason I said the stock is objectively cheap in my thesis and the comparison below will really tell the story.

 [https://imgur.com/E6VVTXe](https://imgur.com/E6VVTXe)

The stock is trading at huge discounts as compared to the sector. Even the Price to book ratio is less than one meaning if you took the equity the company has and divided it by the number of shares then compared it to the current price, you would see that the current price is actually less. Seeing ratios like this tells the story of a company that is in a lot of trouble or the market is incredibly inefficient. Yes, markets are inefficient but not to this scale, which means that investors believe there is something horribly wrong with this company. Having studied their financials and read their filings, I would disagree with the market on this one. Debt is Beazer Home’s most pressing issue which is why I included ratios utilizing EV. Unlike earnings, enterprise value takes a company's debt into consideration and even when comparing EV ratios, the stock still looks cheap.

**Outlook**

So, what’s going on with Beazer Homes USA? Their comparative pricing metrics show they are heavily undervalued compared to the sector, their financials are up big YoY, and the CEO is giving positive statements about the future and raising EPS estimates. Well, the answer is twofold, they have a lot of debt and their margins are poor. The question then becomes will Beazer Homes be able to manage their debt and improve their margins? If you thought so, like me, then now might be a good time to invest in this company.

**They can manage their debt**

As of Q2 ‘21, their total liabilities stand at $1.4B with $250M of that being a revolver draw (similar to a LOC) that they haven’t accessed yet giving them a D/E ratio of 2.2. Compared to the industry average of .86 (according to finviz), obviously not good and certainly a cause for concern. One positive is that only $218M of this debt is a current liability, the rest is long-term debt. Beazer Homes is aware of their balance sheet and had they taken a passive approach to it, I wouldn’t be writing this article but they are not. As a matter of fact, the CEO set a target to reduce their debt to under $1B by FY 2022 and they are very much on track as we can see here

 [https://imgur.com/LXUbZLk](https://imgur.com/LXUbZLk)

They have the determination but what’s determination without capability? Now the question becomes, will they be able to continue paying down their debt? Well, companies need free cash flow to pay down debt and if this company's trend in free cash flow continues, they should be able to reduce their debt effectively as planned. 

[https://imgur.com/bepo5oX](https://imgur.com/bepo5oX)

As you can see they have solid annualized FCF growth and I don’t see any reason this would slow down any time soon with the current housing shortage, Biden’s infrastructure plan, and their commitment to improving their margins (you can see my future FCF estimates in the valuation section).

**Increasing margins**

Beazer Home’s other issue is its operating margin. The company is also aware of this issue and has been taking strides to improve its margins as seen in their EBITDA chart above and in the statement below

[https://imgur.com/eOCdmz](https://imgur.com/eOCdmzZ)

Some of the CEO’s statements regarding margins from their latest filing:

* “We had an extraordinary second quarter, driven by strong operational execution and continued strength in the housing market,” said Allan P. Merrill, the company’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “We generated significant growth in sales pace, average sales price, gross margin and adjusted EBITDA, leading to a doubling in our quarterly net income versus last year. At the same time, we improved our balance sheet efficiency by increasing our share of lots controlled by options while continuing to reduce leverage”
* “Homebuilding gross margin was 17.8%, up 170 basis points. Excluding impairments, abandonments and amortized interest, homebuilding gross margin was 22.2%, up 140 basis points”

**Some more bullish highlights:**

* Blackrock, Beazer Home’s largest shareholder added another 206k shares (8% increase) since their last filing
* CEO increased 2021 EPS estimate to $3.00 from $2.50 (implied earnings of $94M)
* Current housing shortage/high home prices
* Biden’s infrastructure plan includes more than $200B for housing
* Falling lumber and raw material prices
* April 2021 ENERGY STAR® Partner of the Year—Sustained Excellence Award from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Department of Energy for the sixth consecutive year

**Valuation**

I use Damodaran’s DCF analysis using free cash flow to firm to come up with a valuation. Here are the assumptions I made about future cash flows and all other inputs. Sorry, I know it’s not the prettiest but there is a method to my madness (I think). The present value I get from my analysis is $915M or $29.27/share which, compared to the current market cap of $532M or $16.78/per share, would represent a discount of 74%.

[https://imgur.com/UixEb5I](https://imgur.com/UixEb5I)

**I have a price target of $29.27 for Beazer Homes USA.** 

**TL;DR:** Cheap stock because of debt and margin issues that the company has committed to and is able to turn around based on their cash flows in my opinion.

stocks,"SMPL, simply good foods is attractive in this market, as well as a couple more picks. I've watched this stock, and have had some very good swing trades on it over the last year and despite it being near all time highs, I think it's a good buy. The company is in a unique position and is growing at a very good place. Nutritional snack bars and the likes have grown since the lockdowns have ended and people have begun to focus more on weight loss.

The stock is on a clear uptrend, and I believe that this will continue given the recent growth and profits. They do not pay a dividend, and I believe this company will be focusing on mergers now. The p/e is 40 and this is not a value play necessarily, but I do think that given the circumstances, they will grow into that, and the market seems to agree. 

I do not typically do DD on reddit, and I implore anyone with interest to look into them and form your own opinion on It. SMPL has been a resilient stock considering current market conditions and even with the delta variant being priced in, I think the valuation is sustainable. If it falls, I would love to buy more under $30-32. I initially started a position in this company at $21 a share and have since sold my entire position before reentering last week at a cost average of ~$36 a share. Selling puts on the down days may be a good way to sneak in a slightly cheaper cost basis. I also left cash on the side to buy dips, I do not view this as a very risky stock, but I cannot time the market and would like to be liquid enough to buy dips.

Usually I do not go for consumer Staples, but I have liked this stock and I like the trend. This is something different than what I usually post about as well, as I'm big on the oil trade right now, and I'll be honest, it's not going well. So I'm deciding to stop looking at that port for now and ride out the energy earnings and reevaluate in August. I digress.

A couple more picks I do happen to like in this market are  tobacco stocks like MO. 

I am starting to be more of a fan of defensive stocks, such as vertex pharmaceuticals and cigna, although I believe it may be too early in the market cycle to make these buys worth the opportunity cost, but they're safe, and very cheap relative to market. 

Disney is also one of my favorites, I'd be a buyer at these prices to be honest, it seems to have broken up a bit and seems to be holding above support on lower volume. 

Intel is one that I have always liked and I truly like it at this price. I will probably start a position soon. I like the idea of them being in the foundry business and I think that Intel will be able to shine a bit in the next 3-5 years. Not a short term play by any means though."

stocks,"7/16/2021 Some Trade Ideas, also some logic behind the Index and first week of earnings which have been very strong, will wait for next week Good morning everyone, I am writing this at 5:45 AM, so I am not able to get all the news I normally get by 8AM. I still am going to be cautious as I have been all week. The earnings that have come out so far have been very good. It is unfortunate that the indexes have made new highs but this was without a broad market rally. There are about 12-13,000 tickers that trade on US Markets. Nasdaq near 5,000 NYSE near 4,000. However, many are still asking me what do I feel is going on... Unfortunately, the largest 25 stocks on the Nasdaq are near 52 week highs and carrying the index. The market breadth has been horrible. That is measured by the amount of advancers/decliners \[Green/Blue\] Since Fed Chairman has spoke, even on days we are in the green on the Nasdaq, making new highs, there are alot more decliners than advancers. Sometimes more than 3 to 1. I have wrote posts on how 5 stocks are close to 40% of the Nasdaq. \[AAPL, AMZN, MSFT, GOOG, FB\] So this is the divergence. That most worrisome factor for me is if these power houses go down and the Nasdaq comes down to 14,000 does it cause a widespread panic. The new all time high on the Nasdaq is near 14,800 so a correction now is about 13,300.

The earnings have been coming have been a huge beat, as much as last quarter which was the 3rd best since tracking of the SP500. It has been mostly banks and some others as well. It is extremely odd, because banks going into earnings have not rallied much, are making more money than ever, sales are high, these banks have the power to buy shares as well as raise dividends, but these banks are not taking off. The report by GS which by the way had the best earnings report last quarter, was even as good this quarter! Yes, GS did rally into earnings but after that report should still have been rewarded. Why? The company has the power to make 50+ dollars per share, trades around 380, and is still beating. As said earlier these banks/finance have cash to buyback, dividend or special dividend. Remember, the reason people ever get into the stock market in the first place is to earn money from a company that is going to share in the profits. Is SE, SNOW, LMND ever going to be able to do that? So why are they given an insane valuation is wordly. GS could pay everyone 25 dollars a share if they wanted and be fine! They currently pay $8! This is why we were supposed to invest from the start. If I was on the board, I would explore some different strategies to shoot up my stock, because at the end of the day the CEO's number #1 goal is to raise share price.

When a share price is high you can use your share price as currency to buy another company. When your share price is high you can sell it as an employee. The share price is high you can get talent by telling new highers they get a bonus with shares that will vest over time. When your company makes money, they can buy shares and issue them to employees and they can start this whole circle again.... so once again nothing is more important then a high share price. This is how GOOG, AAPL, MSFT, AMAZN, FB have got talent, made acquisitions, using the shares as currency! In 2021 there have been more offerings than ever, especially with companies with horrible financials to raise cash, because once again, high share price. The importance of this is because these banks and financials, have a way to increase share price because their businesses bring cash! These are the companies that should be rewarded for + cash flows and amazing earnings. It does stump me how a CRWD, NIO, TSLA, TWLO are insanely high.

Yesterday, I was trading ZIM, NYCB and NYMT. I will continue to do today. I also did trade TIGR who had 250% sales growth and was profitable. Honestly, I was shocked that GS would give TIGR a sell rating and a $21 target. How do they arrive at this number? I would absolutely love to know.

I may otherwise stay on the sidelines as I will have a busy day. Good luck everyone."

stocks,"XPO Spinoff GXO to Go Public Aug. 2 GXO Logistics will sell shares to the public for the first time Aug. 2 on the New York Stock Exchange, executives said during an investor day presentation July 13.

XPO Logistics Inc. has been working for nearly a year to spin off the global contract logistics operations into its own publicly traded company.

“The spinoff will establish GXO as the largest pure play logistics company with around 5% of the $130 billion of logistics that’s currently outsourced in our key geographies,” said Malcolm Wilson, CEO of the GXO business. “We will be the second-largest contract logistics company in the world.”

Wilson

“GXO has a broad geographic presence that allows us to meet the needs of our global customer base,” Wilson said. “Importantly, our scale makes us one of only a handful of global players that can satisfy the logistics requirements of the world’s largest multinational companies.”

Wilson said the new company can support more than 200 million square feet of warehousing space across nearly 900 locations worldwide and close to 100,000 workers.

GXO was first registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on June 9.

Mark Manduca, who will become GXO’s chief investment officer, told Transport Topics the day after the presentation there was a real appreciation in the market.

“The feedback so far has been extremely strong. We’re very grateful to have phenomenal investors, obviously as part of core XPO, who were extremely supportive. So feedback so far has been good.”

This spinoff that’s taking place now is creating two powerhouse companies.

Malcolm Wilson, CEO of GXO

Manduca said the main area of debate has been the valuation. The process of determining the value of the company will take place over the next few weeks.

“The opportunities for a business that has revenues of around $8 billion is phenomenal going forward,” Manduca said.


He highlighted during the investor day presentation how the logistics company uses a collaborative approach, bringing together sales, implementation and technology expertise to provide solutions tailored to a customer’s current and anticipated needs. He also noted contract terms gives the company outstanding revenue visibility in the near and medium term. Some recent contracts even extend into the five- to 10-year range.

The GXO executives finished the presentation focused on projected growth, cash flow, where there are scale opportunities and the benefits of having the contract logistics operations become its own company.

“This spinoff that’s taking place now is creating two powerhouse companies,” Wilson said. “It allows us to implement our own optimal capital structure, investment identity, the resources, allocation of strategies.”

stocks,"The Future of Plastic's - Potential 100 Bagger # Origin Materials

Origin’s decarbonizing technology addresses a \~$1 trillion market opportunity, and is anticipated to revolutionize the production of a wide range of end products, including clothing, textiles, plastics, packaging, car parts, tires, carpeting, toys, and more.Origin now has partnerships with Nestle, Danone, and Pepsico who are some of the largest plastic users in the world. Match that with their connections from their board, they have the chops to make this work and scale

Origin Materials have developed technology out of UC Davis which creates plastics out of scraps of organic material:

1. wood pulp
2. rice hulls
3. sugar cane stalks, etc.

This process ends up capturing the carbon that would reenter the atmosphere when the scrap material decays into plastics making it an incredibly effective way to capture carbon. Deloitte did some independent analysis and showed it captures 300% of the carbon used in the manufacturing process making it one of the first carbon **negative** production processes!

Not only that, but since they are using scrap material the production costs are not tied to inflation or any other material such as oil.

In fact, they estimate producing these bioplastics at a cost which will be competitive with current oil based plastics - and that doesn’t even include any carbon credit incentives!

Origin is currently building the Origin 1 plant due EOY 2022 which will be their testbed plant that is focused on refining and optimizing their full scale production for both current and future materials. From there, EOY 2024 will mark the completion of their Origin 2 plant which will be a full production scale facility and also create a positive EBITDA. From there, they plan for 5 more plants estimating a $2.3bln EBITDA by 2030! This company has the potential to absolutely boom!

**Leadership**

These folks know their chemistry. Lots of names out of UC Davis where this tech was developed, so this isn’t just some pipe dream MBA bullshit. They also have lots of leadership out of the chemicals production space from the likes of Dow Chemicals. So that’s great on that level, but how do we know they will actually be able to execute?

1. Board Chair - Karen Richardson who is also a board member of BP.
2. Boon Sim - Leader for both Credit Suisse and Temasek Holdings - aka the sovereign wealth fund of Singapore which is known for being one of the most sophisticated funds in the world.
3. Along with that, execs from Clorox, Dupont, and P&amp;G. So tons of experience and connections with huge players. I was on the fence until I saw who was on the board - now I’m stoked.

**Insider Buying and Investment**

1. Just before merger, Charles Drucker bought an additional 650k shares bringing his total ownership to 18.862,500 shares.
2. On top of that, Apollo Funds invested $30m in Origin furthering my confidence in the company.
3. On June 25th, Lior I. Amram and Evergreen InvestCo bought 10m shares furthering the large long term investments in the company.

# Ridiculously Tiny Float

# The current available float is sitting at 29m - but wait, there’s….Less?

# With the buying mentioned above, this is reduced to only 18.23m shares.That is tiny! We are only starting to get a sense for institutional ownership. There just aren’t that many shares available right now so that means the price will be heavily affected by even a small increase in demand. More volatile? Yes, but also will make a runup in price all the more likely.

**Market**

The market is currently pegged at $1tln of potential, so there is tons of room for expansion. But let’s take a look at Danimer Scientific who was another company which merged last year and also looks to produce bioplastics. If you look at their investor presentation you can see they are further along, but their maximum production after all their facilities are built is just a little above what one of the 6 production plants of Origin. And on top of that they have to use vegetable oils, so are prone to crop inflation. Right now they are valued at $25 which according to their data puts them at a 14x multiple of their future EBITDA and a 15% discount rate. The same comparison would put Origin up over $40 a share today.

Origin is primed to cash in on the current boom, Their current projects look to **double** in EBITDA when forecasting for the potential of carbon capture premiums and other environmental opportunities. They can also license their technology to other companies since there is a huge market which one company can never fill. When looking at the demand, they have already gotten $1bln in offtake commitments - and while they could have more - they have chosen to reserve capacity for higher margin items.

On top of all that, Origin now has partnerships with Nestle, Danone, and Pepsico who are some of the largest plastic users in the world. Match that with their connections from their board, they have the chops to make this work and scale. And to go along with that, the merger (with warrants) will provide them with enough funding to get to their EBITDA positive timeframe with another $250mln in buffer. So there is very little risk of dilution via share issuance.

Beyond their factories, they are also looking at licensing hte technology for another revenue stream to further accelerate growth (none of my calculations take this into account). The potential for additional revenue is just absolutely massive since there is a $1 ***TRILLION*** addressable market opportunity. Once in a lifetime opportunity.

**Competitors**

Origin doesn’t have any direct competitors, but it does have some analogs. Danimer Scientific is one, but their focus is on biodegradable plastics. They use canola oil as their feedstock so their price is tied to the price of the commodity - and even at relatively low costs today they still cost $1/lb vs $0.29/lb for Origin. Also, there are a ton of products that **shouldn’t be biodegradable** \- car parts for example shouldn’t be degrading! Purecycle is another analogue, but has the same issues as Danimer Scientific.

In the end, there is **no other company that is looking to make carbon negative plastics**.

**Elephant in the Room**

Plastics are an environmental problem. There are microplastics that are increasing in concentration in the ocean and in ocean life specifically and they have become a disease on the planet. Why am I okay with this personally for Origin? Well simply, it is a step in the right direction. There are a large number of applications which require non-biodegradability but ultimately this begins to get market penetration with **zero modification** for carbon reduction. It’s a trade off for sure, but it’s only the start.

Things start to look much better with net zero fuel pellets and water filters, carbon black, and agricultural applications which (aside from the fuel) are all carbon negative. In the end, this is an insanely huge step towards reducing our carbon footprint and right now that takes priority for me

**Risks**

They currently have no revenue and are building their first plant, Origin 1. This plant is still just a testing plant and they are quite far away from revenue positive. The plant was also delayed a year, likely due to COVID, but they now have the equipment on site.

**Overall**

There is a huge push for countries and companies to reduce their carbon footprint, and this company is set to not only make a very profitable and sustainable product - but to also capture a shitton of carbon doing it. In the long run this company is likely going to explode in value as they have the talent, experience, and in demand product.

There are real risks here, but the upside is **enormous** as this is a true potential unicorn. I’m looking at a potential return of 10-30x

stocks,"$PAYO your Baby Momma so she can feed the kids Payoneer is a payment platform that offers a way for businesses to pay and receive money, for a low fee. Payoneer believes that the total addressable market (defined as global e-commerce volume) is $26 trillion a year. Payoneer processed over $44 billion in 2020 alone.

Payoneer works with 9 of the top 20 most valuable companies. Alongside these big names, Payoneer also has 5 million+ marketplaces and businesses, across over 190 countries.

Payoneer also offers:

* Accounting integrations
* Capital to small businesses
* Regulatory and compliance infrastructure
* Physical debit cards
* Tax solutions

So, it is basically a bank that includes an accountant to help meet a business’ needs. The one product or feature that is missing is digital coins and no doubt they will be offering that soon, if anything they should make that a major priority.

**Management Team**

Scott Galit - CEO of Payoneer, previously a senior VP at MasterCard. Serious financial services pedigree.

Michael G Levine - CFO of Payoneer, ex-City VP and ex-CFO of Maler Technologies. MBA from Wharton.

Betsy Cohen - Tons of finance related experience, including founding Bancorp. Should be able to give Payoneer great advice for future growth.

**Customers**

Payoneer has some big name clients, including but not limited to:

* Amazon Europe
* Google
* eBay
* Walmart
* Upwork
* Fiverr
* AirBnB
* Booking.com

Weird right, they work with Ebay given Paypal does too. This is because they work with countries and specific clients that Paypal not accept into their platform. Investors need to understand that sometimes people have to use other platforms because they the Paypal’s or banks are NOT willing to take the risk. Sure the risk is probably higher but the amount of people that need access to capital or payment process is high when many banks in many countries do not approve people for such type of access.

**Switching Costs**

Integrating, setting up, and teaching staff how to use a new payment platform can be time-consuming and expensive for businesses. Therefore, when a client is set up on Payoneer, it is unlikely that they will switch to another provider. This is best seen by the &gt;100% volume retention that Payoneer has (i.e. customers stay and increase their payment volume).

**Brand**

Payoneer, from what I have seen, has a strong brand (though this is obviously a subjective factor). This idea is reinforced by the presence of their big name clients. Branding is really important in FinTech, businesses need 100% confidence when money and payments are involved. This offers not only stops entrants into their market, but should also facilitate future growth and customer acquisition.

**Network Effect**

Imagine company A is on Payoneer and wants to pay company B. Company A suggests payment through their usual payment processor, Payoneer. Company B now signs up to Payoneer and decides to do all their payments through it etc. This is the network effect that Payoneer enjoys. This is a very powerful barrier to entry - very difficult to overcome, while also hard to create yourself.

**Geographies**

UNSUBSTANTIATED: Conversations on Reddit leads me to believe that Payoneer has a strong presence in Asia. If anyone has evidence, please put it in the comments.

If this is true, it should give Payoneer an edge in capitalising on the future growth of the emerging markets.

Some evidence:

* The CEO has gone on record saying Korea is one of their big market focuses.
* Achieved triple digit growth each year in the asian markets from 2012-2016.

# Valuation and Financials

# Enterprise Value: $3.29 billion

# Projected 2021 revenue: $432 million

# EV/2021 revenue multiple: 7.6x

# 2019-2020 revenue growth: 8.8%

**Institutional Ownership**

Payoneer has some institutional giants already invested, including Wellington Management, Dragoneer Investment Group, Fidelity Management and Research, Temasek, and Franklin Templeton.

**What do I think the future holds for Payoneer? I actually think there are several exits for this company.**

1. **Growth**: The company continues to grow and eventually reach billions of revenue within 5 to 10  years.
2. **Consolidation**: Large international payments processer buys them. Could be Paypal, Square,      Stripe, First Data, etc. consolidation WILL happen in this space and I  think short-term Payoneer will acquire some companies and then be sold to a bigger company. Think of this as how banks in the USA were allowed to merge in 1995 given the law that passed. Before you had 100,000 banks then it was 50,000 banks, then 10,000 banks, and now like 5,000 banks but the top 10 banks make up a large % of the business/volume.
3. **Wildcard**: CRM business buys them. What many people do not realize is that CRM’s have been changing the game. First, it was to help you sell with marketing tools, then it is to improve communication within the team, then it will be stored, and legal transactions then it will be a financial transaction.      They are literally going to control the beginning to the end of the customer relationship and all of that data they possess is very valuable to help their customers grow.

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Thursday, July 15, 2021 **PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, July 15, 2021**

Stocks broadly fell today as market participants continued digesting Q2 earning reports, reassurances from the Federal Reserve that current inflationary pressures is temporary and new economic reports that suggest a slowdown in the global growth rate. After recording several new intraday highs this week, the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) slipped, closing 0.34% and 0.7% down respectively. The Russell 2000 (IWM) fell for the third straight day this week, closing 0.54% down.

Markets seem to have become jittery following the release of the June Consumer and Producer Price Index (CPI &amp; PPI). (CPI), which measures changes in the prices of consumer goods, rose 0.9% in June, accelerating from May’s 0.6%. Year-on-year, the CPI is up 5.4%, exceeding the 4.9% expected by economists and the fastest rate of growth since 2008. Core CPI, which excludes the volatile price energy and food and is therefore considered a more accurate representation of general price inflation, was up 4.5% year-on-year as prices bounced from last year’s pandemic-era lows. PPI, which measures the average changes in prices received by domestic producers for their output rose 1% in June, accelerating to a 7.3% rise year-on-year, while still reflecting base effects. Core PPI rse 5.5%. This is the fastest rate of increase since 2009.

Yesterday, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell gave his semi-annual monetary policy testimony before Congress, where he largely reiterated the same thing he has been saying for months. Powell said “inflation will likely remain elevated in the coming months before moderating” and that the US economy was “still a ways” off from reaching the threshold of “substantial further progress” that would trigger the Central Bank to roll-back pandemic-era policies. In short, Powell basically said while he expects higher inflation prints in the coming months, pressures are transitory and due to pandemic era disruptions and the Fed’s goal for economic recovery have not been met. [Here is Powell’s complete testimony, but here are two of his most important quotes.](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/testimony/powell20210714a.htm)

**On the labor market:** “Conditions in the labor market have continued to improve, but there is still a long way to go. Labor demand appears to be very strong; job openings are at a record high, hiring is robust, and many workers are leaving their current jobs to search for better ones. Indeed, employers added 1.7 million workers from April through June. However, the unemployment rate remained elevated in June at 5.9 percent, and this figure understates the shortfall in employment, particularly as participation in the labor market has not moved up from the low rates that have prevailed for most of the past year. Job gains should be strong in coming months as public health conditions continue to improve and as some of the other pandemic-related factors currently weighing them down diminish.”

**On inflation:** “Inflation has increased notably and will likely remain elevated in coming months before moderating. Inflation is being temporarily boosted by base effects, as the sharp pandemic-related price declines from last spring drop out of the 12-month calculation. In addition, strong demand in sectors where production bottlenecks or other supply constraints have limited production has led to especially rapid price increases for some goods and services, which should partially reverse as the effects of the bottlenecks unwind. Prices for services that were hard hit by the pandemic have also jumped in recent months as demand for these services has surged with the reopening of the economy”.

In other news, new economic data coming out of China, the first country to experience and begin recovering from the virus, is showing a marked slowdown in economic growth. The world's second largest economy expanded at a 7.9% rate in the second quarter from a year ago, according to the National Bureau of Statistics, missing consensus estimates for an 8.0% rise and decelerating sharply from the first quarter's 18.3% increase. In response, the People’s Bank of China signalled it was cutting the amount of cash that banks must hold in reserve, a move that suggests the economic recovery in China may be slowing down. The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) will reduce the reserve requirement ratio by 0.5 percentage point for most banks, according to a [statement](http://www.pbc.gov.cn/goutongjiaoliu/113456/113469/4287599/index.html) published Friday. That will unleash about 1 trillion yuan ($154 billion) of long-term liquidity into the economy and will be effective on July 15, the central bank said. The reduction was signaled earlier this week, when the State Council, China’s equivalent of a cabinet, hinted the central bank would make more liquidity available to banks so they could lend to smaller firms hurt by rising costs. The timing and magnitude of the move, coming a week before second-quarter growth data, suggests worries about the economy’s outlook and was a decisive shift away from policy tightening, which most, if not all, recovering economies are pursuing.  Just to put into more familiar terms, this would be like if the Federal Reserve suddenly turned around and said rather than discussing tapering quantitative easing, it would instead propose pumping more money into the economy.

In good news, the Weekly Unemployment Report showed new jobless claims fall to pandemic-era lows. 

* **Initial jobless claims, week ended July 10:** 360,000 vs. 350,000 expected and a revised 386,000 during prior week 
* **Continuing claims, week ended July 3:** 3.241 million vs. 3.300 million expected and a revised 3.367 million during prior week

**Highlights** 

* Import prices were up 1% in June over May, adding to a 1.4% increase the month prior. This marks the eighth straight month import prices have risen and brings the annual price increase to 11.2%
* Netflix (NFLX) has announced it plans to eventually stream video games on its platform and hired a former Electronic Arts (EA) executive to lead the push. 
* As earnings season continues, big bank stocks continue falling despite, in most cases, posting great earnings. 
* Square (SQ) announced it has acquired Crew, and app that enables real-time access to communicate with frontline hourly workers and assist with scheduling and other managerial services.
* According to Facebook (FB), the company is pledging $1 billion to support content creators on its platforms through the end of 2022. Content creators will receive a monthly bonus if they hit milestones for earnings Stars, a form of digital tipping that fans can use to pay their favorite creators during live-streamed videos. Instagram's bonus programs will include incentives to use Reels, its copycat TikTok feature that showcases short-form video clips. Creators will earn money based on how their Reels videos perform, the company said.
* Microsoft (MSFT) is betting hybrid work will provide an opening to make its Windows operating system more widespread, launching a new service aimed at getting users of Apple (AAPL) and Android products to use the software. Windows 365, the company said, will be accessible on any device running any operating system that has a web browser, such as Apple Mac computers, iPhones and iPads, or those running Android software made by Alphabet (GOOGL)

How did Google rise to the top of the search engine wars? Simple. Google cheated. A small company called Netlist in California developed some leading edge computer memory technology. That technology would let computers and servers of the day access 4 times more RAM (Random Access Memory) than the computer could normally access. Netlist met with Google regarding this technology. They showed the technology to Google in order that Google might license the technology from Netlist. Google didn't license it. Google stole it. Google copied it, had it manufactured, and used it in their servers. Google was caught with Netlist IP in their servers when the court ordered a random check of Google servers that were in operation at that time. Google, with Netlist IP, now had the fastest search engine on the Internet, and went on to leverage that speed and savings to become the giant, powerful company they are today.

Netlist has battled Google for over 10 years to reclaim their intellectual property, and regain the value that their IP should have provided their bottom line and shareholders for many years. Google continued to try and run out the clock, hoping that Netlist would go out of business, or abandon the costly litigation. Netlist has abandoned nothing. Now the tables have turned and the clock is running out on Google. Google lost their latest appeal of the '912 patent at the U.S. Federal Circuit Court of Appeals (Federal Circuit), which upheld the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) affirmation of the patent's validity. Google did not appeal this ruling to the United States Supreme Court, and now the patent has been recertified by the US Patent Office. The trial in the Northern Disctrict of Califonia to determine the level of infingement, and the damages owed to Netlist by Google, has been reopened.

""For ten years Netlist has steadfastly opposed Google's misguided campaign to invalidate the ‘912 patent,"" said Netlist's CEO, C.K. Hong. ""We are very pleased that in the end the appellate court made it clear that the claims of this seminal patent are indeed valid and in so doing, further vindicate our decade-long defense of the company's strategic intellectual property. We will now move to lift the stay in the patent infringement lawsuit against Google in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of CA., in order to recover current and past damages related to the ‘912 patent.""

stocks,"VRT for sustainable growth and BA for a quick win? Been watching VRT for awhile now with limited cash in. It's done nothing but go up... Would it be dumb to get in with a more sizable investment? Looks like a really solid business, with big plans for growth. Seeing a lot of well priced calls too. Thinking I can turn around some of my other poor choices with a well thought out strategy for VRT (always open to suggestions).

On another note, I've taken interest in Boeing these last few weeks. Anyone else a little confused by what's going on with BA? I'm not a pro by any means, but the share price should have been hitting a steady incline. Instead, its taken a few hits and isn't recovering. I get that BA is very headline sensitive stock, and the plane in Hawaii didn't help. But, a few ""news"" stories have been awfully misleading as they were already disclosed by Boeing weeks ago... Why are they just now showing up? Any chance there's something fishy going on (i.e. driving down calls to buy low)?

If anyone has some good insight I'd appreciate it."

stocks,"What Percentage of your portfolio would you put in riskier plays in your early 20s? Hi fellow investors, 

So I was re-evaluating my portfolio and viewing others portfolios and I noticed that my ""riskier"" speculative plays take up a much larger percentage of my portfolio than most.

I would say about 30% are in speculative/disruptor plays. 

I think I have failed to lose the ""play risky"" mindset I had when I was pretty much broke and almost day trading.  

This has served me well to get to a very comfortable amount but I always swore once I reached this specified number I would play it safer to grow slower but with less risk of losing large amounts (I can stomach losing a couple of hundred a day but losing thousands does cause me sleepless nights) 

I have been looking at the expected names and have now brought Berkshire Hathaway up to 6% of my portfolio so have already begun rebalancing. 

I am thinking around 10% in riskier plays is the sensible option but wanted second opinions/advice from other before I did so. 

If any more experienced investors out there can shed any light it would be much appreciated."

stocks,"JEPI - Capital Gains? 
After looking for information about the next ex-dividend date for JEPI. I came across JP Morgan’s ETF distribution calendar that lists off the dates for each of their funds. [distribution calendar](https://am.jpmorgan.com/content/dam/jpm-am-aem/americas/us/en/supplemental/income-distribution-rates/jpmorgan-etfs-2021-distribution-notice.pdf). 

I noticed that JEPI has the option for a capital gains payout in addition to the regular monthly dividend payout. I did notice them payout capital gains last year but that could have very well been since the ETF was brand new last year. Are capital gains something to be expected to be paid out in the future? Do most funds typically have that as an option and choose not to? I’m just trying to learn more because I’m a bit unfamiliar.

Disclosure: I own ~8 shares."
stocks,"[Mining stocks thread] I want to invest in mining stocks. What do you guys think of my list? High mining stocks have become bullish in recent years. With this development, not only the big ones but the small mining stocks are showing a lot of potential and are giving their investors good gains through growth catalysts. 

Currently I have been contemplating on investing in these mining stocks and I need your thoughts about it:

Fortitude Gold ([FTCO](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/FTCO/))

* It’s a small producer but has no debts and [recently increased the monthly dividend](https://www.fortitudegold.com/news/fortitude-gold-increases-monthly-dividend) they are paying 16.7% to $0.035 per common share, or $0.42 annually.

stocks,"What do y'all think about $HIMS? I did a little write up on this revolutionary telehealth company Some general Info about HIMS-

Hims &amp; Hers ($HIMS) is a telemedicine company which allows anybody across the continental United States(and soon to be UK and Europe) to purchase medicine discreetly, safely, quickly, and inexpensively straight to your door. For prescription medicine, Hims &amp; Hers employs hundreds of specialized doctors, which can prescribe medicine through call, text, or video chat. Hims &amp; Hers offers a wide variety of products which continues to expand, such as:

-Hair Loss and Care

-Sex products (ED, PE, Birth Control)

-Skin Care/Acne products

-Covid Tests

-Supplements

-Primary Care

-Mental Care

etc...

So I wanted to do some DD because Earnings should be coming out sometime early-mid august and I expect this to be the first quarter where they can show positive EBITDA, I would expect nothing less than absolutely stellar numbers across the board, with a highlight on YoY revenue growth.

- Customer acquisition, expanding their base of users and subscriptions by expanding into multiple sectors of mens, womens and even mental health

- Bridging the gap between being a telehealth provider and the standard retail brick and mortar model, by establishing partnerships with companies like Target and Urban outfitters putting their products in these big box stores that we all shop at.

- Acquiring companies like Apostrophe, which is a multi-specialty telehealth platform, it was also a competitor, well not anymore now HIMS is the parent company. (Remember how FB liked to buy out all of their competition until they became the biggest platform on the planet... ya HIMS is taking a page straight out of the Zuck's playbook)

- Future Growth prospects; HIMS is expanding into the UK and Europe giving them access to a greater reach of customers, and as we all know, balding, ED, Acne, etc... is not something there is a permanent cure for and something a lot of people suffer from, with a subscription based model they're basically able to lock in long time recurring customers, so you put 2 and 2 together, you put the product in more countries, you get more subscribers.

- Before you tell me that HIMS hasn't turned a profit BLA BLA BLA, Let's look at their last earnings report.

Financially stable - over 90 Million in cash on hand + short term investments, with 0 short/long term debt
Gross Margin of 77% last Quarter, 74% for 2020 (54% in 2019)
2.6B Market Cap
Negative (but improving) Cash Flow
Q4 EPS of -.07 (Beat by .09)
Revenue of $148.8 MM for 2020, 80% yoy growth
2020 Q4 Revenue of $41.5 MM (Beat by $4.47 MM)
Q1 2021 Revenue expects $48 - $50 MM
$195 - $205 MM overall 2021 Revenue estimate
Over 3 Million consultations
91% Recurring Revenue

Simply put, Hims &amp; Hers has consistent, growing revenue and gross margin growth, and the driving factor for their negative EBITDA are their investments into furthering expansion, customer acquisition/company acquisitions that will only help solidify their cash flow and subscription services on the back end in the future.

Last point, just from a trading perspective, HIMS is down thirty percent the last month, and went down 8 percent today, Now is the time to buy a few weeks before a potentially huge earnings report, and with 52 wk low of 8.09, It's definitely at or near the bottom right now. Please note, this isn't a fucking short squeeze BUT the short interest 13% which is kind of high...

TL;DR I've got a boner for HIMS, Jacked to the Dick, YOLO, 8/20 10c all in"

2) The NEL ASA company news flow is very positive;

Revenue: $14.8 billion, vs the $13.98 billion estimate

All of which should play to CEO James Gorman’s advantage. Through a series of savvy acquisitions, Gorman has built up the bank’s wealth management franchise to be one of the largest in the world. He also helped rehabilitate the firm’s trading operations and maintained its leading merger advisory practice.

MS is still the best pick within the financial sector. The CEO did a few smart acquisitions such as e trade. It will diversify the revenue stream and differentiate itself from the traditional bank."

stocks,"Mmat huge potential (You can skip this part if you want) So recently I’ve been doing some DD and found mmat! I found out they had a special divi $1-20 per share the company was once torchlight (trch). I got 37 shares of that dividend. I also joined a subreddit called {deleted} and they have the best DD. 

(Important) A DD post was made explaining my the divi COULD be $35 a share. This is big and here’s why. If the dividend amount is released that it is $35 a share the price will go ballistic. Call options bought before the ex. Dividend date have 100 dividends attached. If the divi is this high then call options even $5 otm will be exercised to try and get that extra $3500 for free. This will be the gamma squeeze will might see on Friday due to options expiring.

(Short squeeze) tomorrow makes the start of the t21 rules for ftd’s this should make shorts start covering. The (possible) gamma squeeze should scare shorts into covering and this is called a double whammy squeeze. Big gains there! NFA

(The kicker) mmat is a metamaterials company. They make materials that cannot be found in nature and the potential for these materials are endless. This company is in the tech and semiconductor category on the nasdaq and if you look at other stocks in this sector you will see that none are below $50. Mmat is seriously undervalued and they barely have any competition (almost none). This company is worth $75 easy but I personally say they are worth $100 a share. I’m am not a financial advisor! But mmat (this might kill some of you to hear) will probably squeeze bigger than amc. But most of us are in it for the long run. This is like owning aapl or amzn at $4.37 a share!! This company will be known more well than Facebook in 10 years (or less). Again these are my claims and not guaranteed. The ceo of mmat is the smartest person even he hold $11 million with of mmat so he knows what’s going on. He’s gonna make shorts burn!! Happy investing better get in early!! (Hey major!)

I was reading on investopedia and it’s not very clear on who can operate on darkpool exchanges.

It says darkpool activity provides anonymity to mutual funds and pension funds that will ultimately accrue to investors.

For example, it doesn’t seem like an etf can make purchases or sales on the darkpool exchange, let’s say Cathie wood’s ARK ETF’s. But what about fidelity and vanguard funds? Are they allowed?

Then we have semiconductors where the space will most likely be co-inhabited. AMD, Intel, Qcom, TSM, mu, and many others will likely find success in this industry over the coming decades.

It’s the same with 3D printing and genomics. There will most likely be many winners in the genomic sector. NTLA, EDIT, CRSP, BEAM, they will likely all be winners of their industry, unless there are some buyouts and consolidations. The same could be said with DDD, DM, and many other 3D printing companies. There is no clear winner at this time and there likely won’t be. They will share the space and likely have their own unique sector, such as one will focus on aerospace and another will focus on automotive.

Tesla has clearly won the EV sector but Toyota and VW may catch up.

How about lidar sensors? Velodyne mic vizion(yes, spelling) and luminar tech are all competing but there is no winner. I kind of feel like lazr will lead the industry but that’s just my hunch. There’s no proof to that.

Sbux, McDonald’s, and cmg dominate restaurants. Nike and Lulu for retail.

stocks,"$16 stock that can go to $50-100. Interested? How about an stock that has $300M+ in revenues, \~$80M of adjusted Trailing Twelve Month EBITDA, a real management team with Fortune 500 senior executive experience, just refinanced debt in Q1 2021 (and has 5 years on the debt before maturity) that grew EBITDA 78% last quarter.  It could go up 3-5x.  Crazy part is this is a deep value stock where the earnings more than justify the increase in the valuation... so, it's not on the come, but here today!

Catalysts?  They've applied to go on the NASDAQ and meet minimum requirements - meaning mutual funds can buy the stock now (see page 32 of 10K dated 2/25/2021).  Management about to have their first earnings call in August 2021 after not having one since March 2020.  I think analysts are going to cover the stock.  When they report Q2 2021, they'll cycle through the horrible Q2 2020 numbers due to pandemic... meaning the trailing twelve month EBITDA will go up 33% (if my projections of Q2 2021 that is at minimum on par with Q1 2021 is true... changing my adjusted TTM EBITDA to actual TTM EBITDA) and that'll get picked up by the quant trading machines.  And management could start going on the road to market the stock after focusing on debt refinancing over the course of the last year or two after their first earnings call in August 2021.  

***CPI Card Group.  Ticker: PMTS.***  \~$200M market cap.  $300M+ revenues.  Adjusted EBITDA of \~$80M (adjusted meaning stripping out impact of Q2 2020 when everyone had a crap quarter - Q3 20 $17M, Q4 20 $17.5M, Q1 21 $22M and if you assume trend is new normal, then Q2 21 is $20M or so).  Last quarter, revenues up 20%, EBITDA up 78%, Op Inc up 137%, adj net income up 337% (adjusted for one-time refinancing costs of debt).  Refinanced their debt 3/2021 and have 5 years on their net $300M of debt.  While debt looks like a lot, remember Debt/EBITDA is only 3.75x - which will continue to down as EBITDA continues growing.  

They make plastic credit cards.  In 2015/2016, the industry moved to EMV (Europay, Mastercard, and Visa) chips - the little chips you see on the right side of all your credit cards.  Manufacturers ramped up capacity.  Industry pulled forward demand and bought a ton of cards.  EMV chips lasted longer than magnetic stripes and expiration of cards went from 3 years to 5 years - reducing demand for cards significantly.  Industry was destroyed due to reduction of demand while supply went up.  #1 and #2 players Thales/Gemalto and Idemia both converted a bunch of their capacity to make drivers licenses and other forms of ID and took capacity out of the credit card industry.  CPI was weakened because they had debt from a dividend recap.  In 2017, CPI interest expense was higher than their EBITDA.  Company is hurtling towards bankruptcy.  

In late 2017, one of their board members who had retired as CFO of Western Union (and before that First Data - so CFO of two Fortune 500 companies and a real exec...) comes out of retirement and jumps in as CEO.  So what happens?  CPI is hurtling towards bankruptcy and probably would have gone under except for the pandemic.  Why?  

Pricing on EMV chip cards had gone to crap and there was little profitability.  Prior CEO had tried to tell people that contactless cards was going to save the company's hide, but reality was that NO ONE wanted to pay for contactless cards or the terminals.  Most of the merchants had credit card readers / terminals that could read contactless, but it cost $150-200 in software to turn on the functionality.  Only maybe 30-40% of the terminals in late 2019 had the software installed.  

What changed?  The pandemic!  Now getting out of the store quickly and making consumers comfortable with going into stores is important.  Not only does going contactless mean that you don't have to stick the card in that little slot and have to stand next to the cashier, but contactless transactions also go faster.  That's why retailers now are paying for the terminals.  By mid-2021, I've seen estimates that say 80% of retailers now have contactless readers.  

For the card issuers, contactless and the pandemic is a chance to get people to shift from cash to credit / debit cards.  Read the Visa and Mastercard Q2 transcripts and earnings releases.  The CEO of Visa says that $18T of transactions can go to credit cards because of contactless.  And in the US, there's a coin shortage that forces everyone to use credit cards.  2% of $18T of what were once cash transactions will pay for a ton of contactless cards!  Contactless is king and is here to stay whether or not the pandemic remains.  Oh and the pandemic is still here.  

When issuers buy contactless cards, the average selling prices and gross profit doubles.  The company's business model has a very fixed cost.  If you look at the sales, general &amp; administrative expenses, they were actually DOWN in Q1 2021 even though gross profit went up.  That's how you end up with a 78% increase in EBITDA while revenues only increase by 20%.  Does that mean the end of it?  Nope.  Here's the really fun part.

CPI's business has a mix of large issuers (JPMorgan Chase, BofA, USBancorp, etc - may not be actual customers, but type of customers) and small issuers (fintechs, credit unions, small issuers, etc).  If you read the Q4 2020 earnings letter, you'll see a large percentage (I think 70%) of large issuers have moved to contactless.  Small issuers as of Q4 2020 had only moved maybe 10% over to contactless.  It took small issuers 3-4 years to move to EMV from magnetic stripe and if this trend repeats, then the earnings for the company will go up for 3-4 years at a rapid clip as small issuers adopt contactless.  The increase in the earnings haven't stopped yet and have a long tail!  If you read the Q4 2020 letter, you'll see that small issuers made up 66% of the company's revenues - meaning that the business is weighted towards the part of the business that is going to grow as small issuers adopt contactless.  

So, what's the valuation for all I'm writing about - the answer is CHEAP.  Market cap is $200M.  Net debt is about $300M (actually less, but let's keep the math easy).  $500M enterprise value.  Adjusted EBITDA of \~$80M.  EV/Adj EBITDA is about 6.25x.  This again is on a company whose EBITDA grew 78% last quarter.  Prior two quarters also had explosive EBITDA growth of north of 50%.  Basically EBITDA has exploded since the pandemic hit and adoption of contactless increased rapidly.  

Assuming a not outrageous 10x EV/EBITDA, then you get an enterprise value of $800M.  Back out the debt of $300M, then the market cap is $500M.  that's about a 3x return on current earnings power.  This isn't a pie in the sky if XYZ happens, but using CURRENT economic earnings.  

Where the valuation gets more interesting is if the earnings continue growing due to increased  adoption of contactless that's HERE TO STAY.  If EBITDA goes to $100M and EV/EBITDA goes to 15x, then one can get to a $1.5B enterprise value.  Again, back out $200M of debt and market cap is now $1.2B.  With 11.6M shares outstanding, it's possible to get to $100 stock price.  

Don't take my word for it.  It isn't on the come.  Go read the company's Q3 2020 - Q1 2021 earnings letters.  Go read the company's 10Q and 10K.  On page 32 of the 10K dated 2/25/2021, you'll see this beauty "" We are evaluating our ability to return to listing on Nasdaq and intend to ***apply for listing on The Nasdaq Global Market as we are able and eligible to do so***.""  They have already applied to go on the NASDAQ.  Just a matter of time.  

When was the last time you read a stock pitch that said to go read the earnings and run your own numbers?  

To recap:

1. Real business... manufacturing business that makes real revenues and real profits
2. Former CFO of two fortune 500 companies that came out of retirement to turn around the business
3. Fast growing business with long tail from continued adoption of contactless credit cards from their majority small issuer (66% of revenues per Q4 2020 earnings letter) customers.
4. Exposure to the fast growing fintech market (customers include oxygen and other fintechs)
5. Fixed cost business model with explosive earnings growth as revenues continue growing.
6. Cheap valuation due to being on the OTC and being currently ignored by all the fund screens and quantitative traders
7. Cheap valuation (again just adjusting out Q2 2020 pandemic quarter that hurt the business temporarily) of ***6.25x EV/EBITDA*** while revenues and EBITDA exploding.
8. Catalysts of NASDAQ listing, first earnings call since March 2020, potential analyst coverage, mutual buying due to re-listing, quantitative trader buying from stock showing up on screens with re-listing and continued adoption of contactless

Happy to answer any questions.  Cheap valuation with earnings TODAY that is overlooked by the market.  This is the definition of deep value."

stocks,"Tattooed Chef (NASDAQ:TTCF) DD - Exponentially Growing Plant Based Food Company  There have been a few posts about Tattooed Chef in the past. However, none seem to fully integrate an entire equity story, which this post will hope to provide.

**Introduction:**

A lot of people have probably heard the Tattooed Chef name at least from when it completed its IPO last year. However, in case you have never heard of it before or don’t fully grasp the growth potential of the company, here is a quick rundown of Tattooed Chef and what they do. They are a food company selling frozen foods products in the freezer isle at major grocery outlets. TTCF’s products are plant based and leverage the secular vegan, vegetarian, and plant-based food trends. While products are sold in the United States, production takes place in Italy. Production costs are much cheaper overseas and allows for higher margins here in the U.S. Additionally, unlike hardly any of its food industry peers with similar market caps, TTCF is vertically integrated, allowing for greater control of product quality and adaptation – in times of rising input prices and inflation, TTCF is consequently less impacted. It's a new age food company clicking on all cylinders and picking up steam competing against companies of yesteryear.

**Revenue Growth:**

To start off, it is important to know how the company is performing. This company completed a IPO last year. However, even before that, the company has been growing extremely quickly.

Here's some of the numbers from 2017 and on.

2017 Revenue ---------------- **$32.5 Million**

2018 Revenue ---------------- **$47.9 Million (+47.4%)**

2019 Revenue----------------- **$84.9 Million (+77.2%)**

2020 Revenue---------------- **$148.5 Million (+74.9%)**

2021 Revenue (Projected) **$239.3 Million (+61.1%)**

2022 Revenue (Projected) **$323.0 Million (+35.0%)**

The growth numbers above are incredibly impressive on their own. If you are unfamiliar with the food industry, seeing any growth that is above 10% YoY is considered extremely high. However, the top line revenues do not tell the whole story. TTCF sells ""Tattooed Chef"" branded products as well as some private label products. What are some of the most valuable assets in the world? Loyal brands. Tattooed Chef realizes this and for the last few years they have been solely focused on its core brand rather than private label deals.

HERE ARE THE GROWTH NUMBERS FOR **ONLY** TTCF LABELED PRODUCTS

FULL YEAR 2019 - **$18.3 Million**

FULL YEAR 2020 - **$84.6 Million (363% Increase!!!)**

2020 3rd Quarter - **$22.6 Million (Year-Over-Year Increase of 288%)**

2020 4th Quarter - **$23.9 Million (Year-Over-Year Increase of 172%)**

2021 1st Quarter - **$36.0 Million (Year-Over-Year Increase of 105%)**

As you can see, branded revenue is what is really important for this company. The CEO himself has publicly stated that private label revenue over time will be 'phased out'. In my opinion, private label products are almost the secondary cherry on the top that aid the top line while TTCF is still establishing relationships with retailers. Invariably, the private label growth story does not matter and should not be factored into the thought process when making a decision to invest or not.

**Earnings &amp; Profitability Potential:**

Most businesses, regardless of the industry, typically lose money hand over fist in their early stages. The fast cash burn usually requires companies in these growth stages to take on debt and issue additional shares. This usually leads to weaker balance sheets and diluted long-term shareholder value. For Tattooed Chef this is not the case. Shareholder dilution is unlikely and debt is unnecessary for the **ALREADY** profitable business. I doubt long term debt will accumulate unless a large acquisition is made.

The hardest part of this analysis is trying to determine future profitability. While profits are growing, it is hard to know what type of net income and EPS numbers this company will be doing in 2026. Revenue is expected to reach $1.0 Billion annually in 2026. Forecasts this far out can sometimes be a far cry from actual results. But, in this case I believe it is an attainable number by 2026. The big question here is... How much of that will turn into profit?

For 2021, management gave guidance, which has been now adjusted upwards, of a gross margin percentage of 20-25%. By 2026, management expects their gross margin to expand to 35%+. Additionally, as I will mention later, the company wants to grow into the snack category, which will also provide major benefits to their margins.

Food businesses generally have lower margins. Once again, trying to forecast net income for a company like this in 2026 is very difficult. I personally believe a 10% assumption is incredibly conservative but its better to be conservative than too optimistic in these types of situations. Margins will be higher for TTCF versus competitors such as Tyson Foods . A Tyson Foods for example, generally turns \~5% into net income. TTCF could make 10% an attainable number in the next five years.

**Management Team:**

CEO Sam Galletti &amp; Creative Director Sarah Galletti

The CEO is basically a veteran in regards to the food industry. He seems pretty credible and hard working. Rather than give my personal take on someone's character and ability to perform, it would probably be best to do your own due diligence on the CEO. But, from what I can tell, he seems to be a good leader/founder of the company. His daughter Sarah literally is ""The Tattooed Chef"" is the face behind the company. She creates, designs, alters, etc. mostly all of TTCF's products.

Valuation

Tattooed Chef currently trades at a market cap of $1.65 Billion. For a growth company at this stage, P/S ratio likely a better metric to use in terms of valuation rather than P/E ratio. Here are the numbers for 2021 and 2022.

**2021 P/S Ratio - 6.89**

**2022 P/S Ratio - 5.11**

This company is trading at 5 times next years revenue. Considering the growth trajectory moving forward, I would consider this to have considerable value. The company also has $185 Million in cash. Considering this very large cash pile (relative to the company's size) it makes the company's market cap a bit more attractive.

**M&amp;A:**

In May of this year, Tattooed Chef announced the acquisition New Mexico Food Distributors, Inc. and Karsten Tortilla Factory. This acquisition was approximately $35 Million. The company still has $185 Million in cash (as of the last earnings report). This leaves lots of room for further expansions and acquisitions.

While only $35 Million was spent, a significant amount of revenue will be generated from this acquisition. ""We will be immediately addressing the $1 billion Frozen Mexican Food category once the transactions close. At full capacity, we believe Foods of New Mexico can contribute up to $200 million annually in revenue in the next two to three years and create significant value for all our stakeholders.""$200 Million in annual revenue for only $35 Million? Sounds like a good deal to me.

**Current Retail Distribution Points:**

TTCF is in many large retailers already. Target, Walmart, Sam's Club, Costco, Whole Foods, etc. However, these are not just situations where TTCF has a few items in one freezer door. Tattooed Chef has been increasing the number of SKUs that they have in each location.

**IN THE LAST QUARTERLY CONFERENCE CALL THE CEO STATED THAT TARGET CLAIMED TATTOOED CHEF WAS THE MOST SUCCESSFUL FROZEN FOOD LAUNCH IN THE HISTORY OF TARGET.** This is obviously huge for the company. Target is already a big deal for this company and this level of confidence from Target is exciting. Additionally, TTCF wasn’t fully rolled out in most Target locations until Q2. So, the Q1 revenue numbers don’t even account for a full Target launch.

If you want to see some of the pictures that have been gathered with all the sell through that has been seen at Target, message me (post won't allow for pics).

**Kroger Announcement:**

Up to this point, TTCF had solely been in retail locations that did not specialize in only selling food – read the names above again (Taret, Walmart, Sam’s Club). However, just this week, Tattooed Chef announced that they will be partnering with Kroger and plan to have 12 SKUs (for now, will increase in the future) in all Kroger locations by September. For those of you that don’t know, Kroger is the 2nd largest grocer in the U.S.

**New Products:**

This company is coming out with new products all of the time. It seems like every month new flavors and styles of food are announced. But you may be asking the question and saying... ""This is just a food company that sells stuff in the freezer isle. What's the big deal?"" Well the company is currently working on expanding past **JUST** the freezer isle. Plant-based tortillas are currently being talked about. Plant-based snacks are also scheduled to come out late 2021/early 2022. A new executive was just hired a few weeks ago who specializes in the snack industry. In the same way boring old PepsiCo was able to expand into dozens of brands and product styles, TTCF would be able to do the same **IF** they continue their success.

**Marketing Strategy:**

Remember the massive growth numbers we talked about for ""Tattooed Chef"" branded products? Well until 2021, the budget for marketing and advertising TTCF products has been **$0.00**. Until this year, **100%** of their growth has been through their own making. **NOT** with a massive marketing budget. Small TV campaigns and mobile ads are being paid for as of the last few months. More importantly, brand ambassadors/influencers will also be sponsoring TTCF as well. Now that advertising will be impacting the company, I expect brand recognition to steadily increase. Some view this

**Balance Sheet:**

Going over everything on a balance sheet would make this (already long) post even longer. But I have two main things on the balance sheet I would like to point out. Cash as of 03/31/2021 is $185 Million. Meanwhile, long term debt $1.9 Million. The company currently has almost no debt and is cash loaded. Considering this is a company which has $1.65 Billion market cap, $185 Million is a considerable amount of cash. So technically, the valuation of the company is over 10% strictly in cold, hard cash. This is very appealing.

**TAM OPPORTUNITY (Total Addressable Market):**

The total addressable market for TTCF is very large. Virtually anyone who eats food (regardless of dietary lifestyle) are potential customers for TTCF. Plant based, vegan, and vegetarian diets are all growing in popularity. Plant based foods had 13% compounded annual growth rate from 2017-2019. These numbers are expected to continue for the next decade.

**Risks:**

Like all businesses, the company does have many risks. The company is in an extremely competitive market. The food industry will always have big money moving products in and out and competition will continue to be ruthless.

The many retailers TTCF has gotten into could give away the hard earned shelf space. This goes hand and hand with competition risks. If Target, Walmart, Costco, etc. finds a better product, TTCF is at risk of losing the valuable real estate of shelf space.

I believe plant based diets are a trend, not a fad. But, if vegetarian/vegan/plant diets die off in popularity, then Tattooed Chef would likely begin to follow suit as well.

Low margins are kind of the norm for food based businesses. Low margins means less room for error. Profits will likely remain constrained to certain levels for the lifespan of the business.

**TLDR: Tattooed Chef is a plant based food company that has been growing exponentially since hitting the public markets. Last quarter, it had the most successful frozen food launch in the entire history of Target. Just this week, TTCF was announced to be expanding into all Kroger locations by September. Additionally, the company has a strong capital position with a large cash balance and minimal debt that is poised for M&amp;A and also organic expansion into new product categories - the management team recently took on a new leader from Pepsico that specialized in snacks. While some may say TTCF received a transitory benefit from COVID, it's recent performance is clear that the company's best days are ahead of it. With recent price depression over the past couple weeks, TTCF is a great security to exit if growth stocks continue to experience weakness.**

stocks,"When exactly to sell to avoid receiving the dividend on single stocks? Living in the UAE, I pay zero taxes on dividends and capital gains.


However, the US applies a 30% witholding tax on dividends from all US stocks and ETFs.


For ETFs, this can be avoided with Ireland domiciled accumulating funds (internal witholding is just 15%, due to tax treaties), or with synthetic-replication (synthetic ETFs outperform physical ones by a factor equal to the dividend witholding), or by rolling a position on a future every month (cost of carry and commissions being way lower than the witholding, and the index not accounting for any tax).

All cool.


Except I hold positions in single stocks and ETFs not tracked by any future or available in Ireland (example: SCHD).


So, here's my question: would it make sense to buy before the ex-dividend date and buy back later? Or does the price drop after the ex-dividend date already usually accounts for the witholding tax (US-based investors should pay less than 30% on dividends, right)?


If it makes sense, then how exactly would that work? Suppose the ex-dividend date is 07/15. Should I sell at market close on 07/14? Or at 07/13? And can I buy back at 07/15? Or 07/16?

stocks,"Market Crash Discussions In This Sub Market Crash Incoming!  

It appears that we have a similiar post just about everyday. I find myself reading these market crash threads that somehow make it to the top.
Sure it varies, the topic would be something like ""How would I make money on a crash if it is coming"" or ""Schillers PE ratio"" or ""Stop crying about a crash it's not happening""
There seems to be a lot of confusion about what's going and the comments or responses this sub is providing is rather concerning and often misleading. I am not going to link any of these
comments because I don't feel it is necessary to directly call out specific people for their bs. I'd like to provide you guys with a few things that Ive learned over the years. Hopefully this will clear the air
and stop the spread of misinformation.  

First and foremost, Michael Burry is not and has not been predicting a market crash for the last 20 years. For some reason a few people in this sub like to 
shit on the guy for being a ""permabear"" or a tin foil hat doomsday guy. If you review his 13F filings or actually fucking listen to the guy you would know that he's
been historically long. He predicted the dot com bubble and shorted. He predicted the housing bubble, sure a little early and shorted it as well. This year when he was 
being interviewed about his gamestop bet he put everyone on notice in January that he was shorting Tesla (which was over $850) critizing the company of buying into BTC.
Here we are and BTC is about the same price TSLA purchased their $1.5B in BTC so if the downtrend continues that 'cash' will be locked up for quite some time. He didn't 
make that bet solely because of BTC but more importantly due to what happened over the last few years to TSLA. In my opinion, it's one of the greatest cons; the companys 
inclusion in the S&amp;P500. There's nothing wrong being added to an index if the company is properly valued but to run up a stock 500-1000%+ to an extremely overvalued stock onto everyones retirement fund.
""All those numbers work out to about a 1.6% weighting for the Tesla in the index. Tesla is already the most valuable company ever added. At a weighting of 1.6%, Tesla will also become the largest weighting ever added.""
Go check out the volume chart for Tesla, specifically Dec 18th putting tesla at $700ish a share. You get the pump into that first earnings and we've been in a downtrend ever since. 
Oh yea, did I mention that's when Burry made his bet? Literally near the top. Tesla volume has also been slowly declining so the buying or next uptrend will come from positive news. What positive news is there for Tesla when
other car companies are showing up to the EV party? They're going to eat market share, the space is going to be crowded (great for consumers) and fundamentals just don't make sense.  

The problem I foresee with his bet is that inclusion price level. If you're betting for TSLA to drop below that $700 you're betting against the everything tied to the S&amp;P500 (401k, IRAs etc)
and as we learned in 2020 the Feds have no problem turning on the money printer. Before I talk about that let me sum up my point about Burry. He made a bet against Tesla, not against the entire market. He put his money 
where is mouth is and he nailed it (so far, looking forward to next 13F). That does not mean he's a doomsday bear. Now stop making these claims until he places the doomsday bet and if and when does place that bet, lets discuss!  

Feds and the money printer. I've read a few comments from you guys or gals stating something like ""Just keep kicking the can down the road"" and truth is, that's exactly what happened. You're right. We had a president who 
woke up everyday and judged his performance by comparing it to the stock market. I've heard that he was the biggest fan of Tesla! Believe me! A president so involved in the market was likes the which never seen before, ever. 
Ok, enough with the Trump speech. There is nothing wrong with letting American captialism do is fucking thing! Oh no, the market lost its gains over 3 years. Yes, the 3/4 years Trump was president he was down 2% due to a pandemic.
Boo Fucking Hoo. The dot com bubble wiped 5 years of gains. The 2009 hit wiped 6 years of gain. Yet we take a baby 3 year hit and thats enough for the money printers get turned on? A fire isn't exactly bad for the forest. 
We had a great oppourtunity to let shit companies take a hit and go under. Let people file bankruptcy and reset. That's when you start pumping the money. You pump the money to give people the oppourtunity to make shit happen until it doesn't work 
again. Yet we pumped the money so things can stay the same. So the monopoly board doesn't get flipped. This is frustrating because I witnessed a lot of people make the right play by waiting. I just read a comment on here a few hours ago
someone stating ""I thought it was going down another 10-20%"" and you were right. It was going down until the Presidents ego took a hit. How terrible would it be for Trump to have a negative market 
return during his tenure! The american people were robbed of an oppourtunity and now their cash is further diluted.

But you guys need to pay attention and stop putting down the doomsday talk or people interested in the eventual crash. It's coming. The writing has been on the wall for a while. Go take a peak at Bank of America 10Qs before 2018
when they battling consumer debt but increasing credit limits to make the books look better! That freefall at the end of 2018 was fun and now they don't even mention their worries about consumer debt! It magically vanished!

Follow the advice of Peter Lynch C SPAN Video: [Redacted By Mods] (18min mark is great shit)  

Keep your eyes on the whales:  [Redacted By Mods] notice they're selling ;) or holding large amounts of cash!  

Escalator up, elevator down! When the market does finally take a proper hit without interference you need to have the stomach to handle investing on the dip.
Believe in what you see and make it happen. It's not going to be easy. Unless you're making money on the way down you have to survive the initial shock and gut up whatever you can to make the bets. 

I've seen and been here before. Trim on the way up and take profits. Slowly fade out of companies that are not making money and have debt. Stay away from the current
stock dilutions where companies are offering stock in attempt to payoff their debt that they have been taking over of the last 5+ years. We're all going to have a great oppourtunity. Yes AMC with 5.5B in debt 
selling shares to pay 1/10th of it off. LOL. There are plenty of companies doing this or will need to do this. I originally posted this before market open but our boy Scotty didn't want to approve the links so thanks Scotty for letting people take a 15% hit on AMC by not approving of my warning.

Again, I can't predict when it's going to happen. But these negative comments like ""It's never going to happen."" or ""Doomsday people like Burry have been wrong for 10+ years during this bull run"" are false and misleading. 
It really needs to stop. There is nothing wrong with talking about it or asking questions like ""how do I protect myself"" or ""how can I make money off a crash"" etcetc. I'd like to encourage you all to continue to be interested 
in protecting your investments and asking challenging questions that bulls have trouble comprehending."

stocks,"Stocks for inflation/ raised rates What stocks do you guys think we should look into if inflation is more than transitory and the fed raises rates sooner? Here a my picks:

$JPM: JPMorgan is stock piling cash so they can loan it out when rates are higher, effectively setting themselves up to do good when the fed raises rates. Their dividend is 2.31% with a P/E of 12

$AVB: Avalon bay is a real-estate play. They focus on apartment buildings in developing areas, so in economy crash they won’t be having empty commercial buildings, and they will make more money with inflation as rent prices go up. Any debt they have will vanish with inflation. Their dividend is 2.87% with a P/E of 39(high) 

$MCD: McDonald’s is one of the biggest real estate company’s out there, so their property value would only go up in case of inflation. 47% of their stock price comes from operations over seas, so that would protect against the fed, where 44% of share price comes from US operations. Dividend is 2.18% with a P/E of 34

$WBA(Walgreens): Shipping prices are already going through the roof and company’s haven’t even started passing along trucking, container and cargo plane price increases. People will be shopping and buying tooth paste, and other necessities from Walgreens instead of ordering online. Market cap is $40 billion and they have $16 billion in debt that will vanish away with inflation. Their dividend is 3.95% with a P/E of 17.

It took me about a month or so to be in the green and about couple of weeks ago I was up about 15% or so. 

Thought of closing the position and taking the profit, but decided to stick to my long term view.

However, these days the stock is deeply in the red for me like 9.3%. 

Should I have closed the position when I had the chance and reinvested in dividend stocks perhaps?

Now Check todays $SPY chart... IS IT CORRUPTION?"
stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Wednesday, July 14, 2021 **PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, July 14, 2021**

Stocks largely gained today in another volatile session, with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ) once again powering to new intraday highs, the third time this week for the SPY. The major indexes continue to be driven higher by continued strength in mega-cap tech stocks. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small caps, continued its streak of underperformance, trading 1.65% lower today at the time of writing. Market participants continue to digest new inflationary data, Q2 earnings season, and Jerome Powell’s testimony before Congress. 

This week, the market is starting to experience signs of volatility, with the SPY opening the session firmly in the green before falling until about the middle of the session before recovering to close the day green. It seems to me that recent reports about inflationary data have injected some uncertainty into the market. The Labor Department’s June Consumer Price Index (CPI), which measures changes in the prices of consumer goods, rose 0.9% in June, accelerating from May’s 0.6%. Year-on-year, the CPI is up 5.4%, exceeding the 4.9% expected by economists and the fastest rate of growth since 2008. Core CPI, which excludes the volatile price energy and food and is therefore considered a more accurate representation of general price inflation, was up 4.5% year-on-year as prices bounced from last year’s pandemic-era lows.

Today, a report by the Labor Department showed that the Producer Price Index (PPI), which measures the average changes in prices received by domestic producers for their output rose 1% in June, accelerating to 7.3% rise year-on-year, while still reflecting base effects. Core PPI rse 5.5%. This is the fastest rate of increase since 2009.

While the CPI and PPI prints are not ideal, the market’s somewhat muted reaction (though there was a little volatility) seems to confirm that market participants are increasingly pricing in higher-than-expected inflationary data and are buying into the Federal Reserve’s argument that current pressures are transitory and due to pandemic-related disruptions. Moreover, it is very important to consider that current inflationary data is calculated on a year-on-year basis, so base effects are very much inflating the current numbers. In other words, inflationary readings are high because they are being measured using numbers from June 2020 when prices across the board collapsed as lockdowns and social distancing policies were implemented across the world. As I have said many times in the past, I am personally not yet worried about current inflationary pressures translating into a prolonged cycle of higher prices, though one always has to acknowledge the risks in the market and be prepared to act. 

In other news, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell gave  his semi-annual monetary policy to Congress, where once again, he basically said the same thing he has been saying for months. Powell said “inflation will likely remain elevated in the coming months before moderating” and that the US economy was “still a ways” off from reaching the threshold of “substantial further progress” that would trigger the Central Bank to roll-back pandemic-era policies. In short, Powell basically said while he expects higher inflation prints in the coming months, pressures are transitory and due to pandemic era disruptions and the Fed’s goal for economic recovery have not been met. [Here is Powell’s complete testimony, but here are two of his most important quotes.](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/testimony/powell20210714a.htm)

**On the labor market:** “Conditions in the labor market have continued to improve, but there is still a long way to go. Labor demand appears to be very strong; job openings are at a record high, hiring is robust, and many workers are leaving their current jobs to search for better ones. Indeed, employers added 1.7 million workers from April through June. However, the unemployment rate remained elevated in June at 5.9 percent, and this figure understates the shortfall in employment, particularly as participation in the labor market has not moved up from the low rates that have prevailed for most of the past year. Job gains should be strong in coming months as public health conditions continue to improve and as some of the other pandemic-related factors currently weighing them down diminish.”

**On inflation:** “Inflation has increased notably and will likely remain elevated in coming months before moderating. Inflation is being temporarily boosted by base effects, as the sharp pandemic-related price declines from last spring drop out of the 12-month calculation. In addition, strong demand in sectors where production bottlenecks or other supply constraints have limited production has led to especially rapid price increases for some goods and services, which should partially reverse as the effects of the bottlenecks unwind. Prices for services that were hard hit by the pandemic have also jumped in recent months as demand for these services has surged with the reopening of the economy”.

**Highlights**

* Big banks continued to underperform today, with investors not impressed despite banks posting very strong earning reports. . JP Morgan, which is often considered a bellwether for the US economy given its sheer size, reported great results, driven in part by the release of $3 billion the bank had set aside to protect against potential losses from default loans during the pandemic, a sign that consumers held up better than the bank expected. JPM recorded revenues of $31.4 billion and profits of $11.948 billion, a staggering improvement from profits of $4.687 billion a year ago. One downside from the earnings report is a sharp reduction in revenues produced from trading, which is not surprising given the insane run by the market in 2020. 
* Airline stocks initially gapped up in the morning after American Airlines (AAL) and Delta Airlines (DAL) offered upbeat outlooks for the second half of 2021, citing increasing consumer demand as the US continues to reopen. However, stocks were unable to hold onto their gains and largely finished negative.
* Twitter (TWTR) announced it was discontinuing its disappearing Fleets feature after failure to win traction with users.
* According to Facebook (FB), the company is pledging $1 billion to support content creators on its platforms through the end of 2022. Content creators will receive a monthly bonus if they hit milestones for earnings Stars, a form of digital tipping that fans can use to pay their favorite creators during live-streamed videos. Instagram's bonus programs will include incentives to use Reels, its copycat TikTok feature that showcases short-form video clips. Creators will earn money based on how their Reels videos perform, the company said.
* Microsoft (MSFT) is betting hybrid work will provide an opening to make its Windows operating system more widespread, launching a new service aimed at getting users of Apple (AAPL) and Android products to use the software. Windows 365, the company said, will be accessible on any device running any operating system that has a web browser, such as Apple Mac computers, iPhones and iPads, or those running Android software made by Alphabet (GOOGL)

I understand the gist of inflation: the government needed money for COVID relief and printed trillions. Now there is trillions more dollars circulating throughout our economy and this will lead to increased prices amongst goods and services due to the value of the dollar going down.  
  
I don't understand how this would affect stock prices. If the prices of goods and services go up, would the market not even itself out since people have more money to spend? And would the value of companies be affected if the value of the dollar goes down yet earnings go up?"

stocks,"Question: Is now a good time to buy into Gold/Mining stocks? Hello, 

I am new on this subreddit and as an investor. I’m a college student with a spare chunk of change to invest. I am looking into investing in a few gold companies (barrick gold, B2gold, and ssrm primarily). Gold stocks have been down the past few months and inflation is not seemingly likely to go down anytime soon, so I thought it may be a good time to buy. I would welcome and appreciate your thoughts/suggestions."
stocks,"The best gold stocks (IMO) worth buying right now # Gold miners vs Junior Gold miners

When looking at gold stocks, you usually have two choices. One, you go for the miners that already produce a decent amount of gold or have solid gold reserves meaning that they can produce a lot of gold in the future. Ideally, the company will have a mix of both, a solid production capacity combined with a lot of reserves to back it up. Two, you go for the junior miners which are essentially miners that are still in the exploration and/or development phase. There is no official definition for junior miners so there is a decent amount of analysts who also classify miners not listed on major indexes as junior, essentially miners with a lower market capitalisation. Personally, I go for the first definition, meaning that I classify them as miners who are still exploring or developing. In my opinion, junior miners are harder to analyze and you need more knowledge and experience to be able to pick the good ones. With them, you can easily lose a big chunk of your investment if they focus on exploring and developing the wrong land, but you could also make a lot of money if they hit the mother lode! There is a really good example of junior gold miners in the media and that's Matthew McConnaughey's 2016 movie Gold. It's obviously dramatised, but it you watch it, you'll get a decent idea of what junior gold miners do. It probably comes as no surprise that junior miners are classified as either growth or penny stocks. Also, they typically do not pay dividends as they reinvest their earnings in mining more gold so in my opinion they are much, much riskier than the established miners. I only really buy them through an ETF and for that I use the VanEck Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF or GDXJ. I think that removes some of the risk, but it is still a risky investment so be careful, especially if you are not that familiar with the gold markets.

# What to look for

Lets look at the first gold stocks that I mentioned, the established miners. The big question is how to pick the best gold miners? Typically, the most important metrics here are the production capacity and the efficiency of operations measured by the all-in sustaining costs, followed by the company's gold reserves. Reserves can be several different types and they are categorised by the degree of certainty. Proven and probable have the highest degree of certainty, followed by measured and indicated which have a medium degree, whereas inferred is the lowest degree. Essentially, if a company has a million ounces of probable gold reserves, then that company is likely to produce a million ounces after accounting for dilution, waste and so on, but if that million ounces is inferred, then the final number can be, for example, only 800 thousand ounces. Also, even the best company is not worth buying if it is overpriced so we obviously need to look at the generic valuation metrics as well. And, finally, most gold miners will also mine other types of metals so that should also be considered.

The 3 biggest gold miners in the world in terms of production are Newmont, Barrick Gold and AngloGold Ashanti, but one look at their all-in sustaining cost tells us that there are more efficient gold stocks out there so let's dig a bit further.

# Polyus

Personally, the most appealing gold stock that I have seen so far is Polyus, which is a Russian gold miner company. They have the lowest all-in sustaining costs by a wide margin - $604 in 2020 which is almost $200 less than the next company at $788. That is a massive, massive margin, especially given that Polyus is the 4th biggest gold producer in the world with 2.8 million ounces of gold produced in 2020. They have massive gold reserves, they just received a positive feasibility study on a new 67 million ounces deposit which could produce 2.6 million ounces of gold annually at an all-in sustaining cost of under $400 dollars which is absolutely amazing and means that they can double their production while lowering costs . According to Yahoo Finance, the company has a 5.4% dividend yield which is also extremely attractive and is trading at a PE ratio of 10.7 which is decent. Polyus also has absolutely massive gold reserves with about 61 million oz probable gold reserves. The most obvious drawback of the company is that its operations are 100% Russian and there may be significant political risk there. Also, unfortunately, the company is not trading on any major exchanges, it is only traded over-the-counter which is a shame, but that just means that we need to follow the stock to see whether it will become available to the wider public soon.

# B2Gold

The next gold stock is B2Gold which is a Canadian gold mining company. B2Gold had the second cheapest gold mining operations in 2020 at $788 all-in sustaining costs. This gold miner produced just over 1 million ounces of gold in 2020 and is projecting a tiny decline in 2021 by between 10 and 70 thousand ounces. B2gold has over 6 million ounces of probable reserves and over 20 million ounces in indicated or inferred reserves. The gold miner operates 3 mines in total, one in Mali, the Philippines and Namibia. B2Gold is also developing mines in Burkina Faso and Colombia. B2Gold is one of the cheapest gold stocks right now with a PE ratio of 6.6 although its forward PE is 19.1 and one reason behind this is that B2Gold is expecting its all-in sustaining costs to rise about 13% to something along the lines of $870 to $910 in 2021. On the bright side, the company has a tiny long-term debt of $76 million. At the same time, it has $480 million in cash equivalents on a market cap of $4.3 billion meaning that the company is financially healthy. Its enterprise value is just $4.04 billion and its ratio of enterprise value to revenue is just 2.28. Over the last 12 months, B2Gold has had a free cash flow of $632 million or $0.57 per share. This gives us a strong free cash flow margin of 33.65%. They are paying a decent dividend, too, at about 3.86%. Overall, B2Gold is looking like a great bargain right now in my opinion.

# Kirkland Lake

Next on my list is Kirkland Lake which is another Canadian gold mining company and it has the third cheapest gold mining operations after B2Gold at an all-in sustaining cost per ounce of $800. Unlike B2Gold, Kirkland is expecting to see the same all-in sustaining cost in 2021 which is good to see. In terms of gold production, the company reported a figure of 1.37 million ounces of gold in 2020 and is expecting similar results in 2021. The company operates 3 mines in 2 different countries, Canada and Australia, which means that there is pretty much no geopolitical risk compared to other companies like Polyus and B2Gold. 2020 was a good year for Kirkland as the company managed to return $848 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Their dividend is actually not that high, it is only 1.89%, but it is well covered by their cash flow which means that it is sustainable. One of the best features of Kirkland is that the company has no long-term debt, which is interesting to see in an extremely capital-intensive business like mining. They have about $800 million in cash equivalents on a market cap of $10.5 billion. In terms of valuation, they are currently trading at a PE of 14.4 and a forward PE of 12.9 which is actually quite decent. Their free cash flow margin is 21.1% which is not the greatest when compared to its peers, but it is still good. Overall, Kirkland Lake is another decent gold stock with a reliable dividend and cheap mining operations.

# Newmont, Barrick, AngloGold and Kinross

Finally, let's take a look at the biggest producers. They have higher all-in sustaining costs, but are they actually a bad deal right now? The top five gold producers in 2020 were Newmont with 5.8 million ounces of gold, followed by Barrick Gold at 2nd place with 4.8 million ounces, AngloGold Ashanti at 3rd place with 3 million ounces, Polyus at 4th place with 2.8 million ounces and Kinross Gold at 5th place with 2.4 million ounces. I already talked about Polyus so lets take a look at the other four. In terms of all-in sustaining cost, all four of them hover around $1,050 per ounce of gold mined with the exception of Kinross which is at $987. Newmont has proven and probable gold reserves of 94.2 million ounces which is the biggest in the industry plus 70 million ounces of measured and indicated gold reserves and inferred reserves of 31.6 million ounces. Barrick's total proven and probables reserves are 68 million ounces, their measured and indicated reserves are 166 million ounces and their inferred reserves are 43 million ounces. AngloGold Ashanti has 29.7 million ounces of proven and probable reserves and 124.5 million ounces of measured, indicated and inferred reserves. Finally, Kinross Gold has 30 million ounces of proven and probable reserves, 32.4 million ounces of measured and indicated reserves, and 9 million ounces of inferred reserves. All four companies also produce silver, copper and other copper-related metals like zinc and lead so that is a nice diversification and ensures that these gold stocks will not suffer too much if gold prices drop. To me, Newmont and Barrick Gold stand out as having the best metrics, but are they the best deal? Let's take a look at the PE ratios. I'm not surprised to see that Newmont has the highest PE ratio with 21.8 followed by Barrick Gold with 15.3. AngloGold Ashanti has a PE of only 8 and the PE of Kinross Gold is just 5.9, almost 4 times less than Newmont's! To get a better idea of their valuation, we can also take a look at their price-to-sales ratio. Newmont is again at the top with 4.36, followed by Barrick with 2.93, then Kinross and AngloGold with 1.84. It becomes obvious that Kinross Gold and AngloGold are cheaper than Newmont and Barrick Gold, but is there a reason behind that? If we look at their free cash flow, it becomes obvious that Newmont runs the most efficient business with a free cash flow margin of 31%, followed by Barrick Gold with 25.2%, AngloGold with 24% and finally Kinross Gold with 9.7%. What this tells us is that Kinross is investing the most money into property, plants and equipment and generally growing its business which can be good, but it could also mean that the current business needs improvement. Newmont, AngloGold and Barrick seem to have less of a reason to invest a lot of cash into growing their business given that they already have massive gold reserves and a massive production so they are in a better position in my opinion. We can also see that the companies are returning money to the shareholders through dividends which is a good sign. Newmont again has the highest dividend yield of 2.77%, followed by AngloGold with 2.42%, Kinross Gold with 1.94% and Barrick Gold with 1.68%. It is worrying to see that Kinross Gold is paying a similar dividend to the rest when they have the lowest free cash flow, but one of the reasons why investors buy gold stocks is because of their dividend so perhaps stopping or lowering their dividend will harm their existing shareholders. Finally, let us take a look at their financial health. How much debt do they have? AngloGold is at the top with a 55.7% debt-to equity ratio meaning that they have $55.7 worth of debt for every $100 of equity. They are followed by Kinross Gold with 29.5%, Newmont with 28.4% and finally Barrick Gold with 16.1%. Out of all four, only Barrick can cover all of their short- and long-term debt with their available cash which is a big plus for that specific gold stock. Okay, so, my take on these four gold stocks is the following: Barrick Gold seems to be the most appealing to me right now. It has the strongest finances, a decent free cash flow, it is at a reasonable price, it has an okay dividend. Newmont has the best dividend even though it has the highest valuation which is good to see, but I think that it could be worth waiting to get the company at a better price. Kinross and AngloGold Ashanti look okay as well, but the low free cash flow on Kinross and AngloGold's high debt make me a bit suspicious although their cheap price compensates for that.

# Other gold stocks

Finally, I want to mention a few other gold stocks. A lot of people talk about Equinox as one of the flashier, fast-growing gold companies out there, but I'm personally not convinced. Equinox is showing decent revenue growth, but its all-in sustaining cost is high and is expected to grow even higher next year to between $1,190 and $1,275 per ounce, one of the highest in the industry! It has a very high PE of 32.8 compared to the other gold stocks and its free cash flow margin is only 2.6%, plus the company has a relatively high debt-to-equity ratio at 40%. It's not paying a dividend, which makes sense for a growing company, but what I am trying to say is that I am personally not seeing the bullish case here, at least not right now. Then, we also have Centerra, Karora Resources, Dundee Precious Metals, Torex Gold. All of them look decent, but they are small cap gold stocks that are not traded on the major exchanges so I haven't looked into them that much. These type of stocks tend to have lower liquidity than the rest of the gold stocks that I have covered which means that the price can be much more volatile and in some extreme cases, you can even even end up with shares that nobody wants to buy so be careful if you decide to trade them.

Alright, these are some of the best gold stocks on the market in my opinion. What do you think? What is your favourite gold stock?"
stocks,"ELI5 - cost per share calculation Cost per share seems like a simple enough calculation. The cost of the stock divided by the number of shares. Easy enough. 

But, this is not making sense to me:

I bought 525 shares at $24 per share - total cost $12,600.  The price of the stock went up, and at $39 I decided to sell 325 shares. This allowed me to recoup my initial $12,600. So now I have 200 shares, and zero money out of pocket. 

So if I own 200 shares and have no money out of pocket, it essentially means those shares have a $0 cost. Right? My TD Ameritrade says that those 200 shares have a cost per share of $40. 

And since I am out no money at this point, my ""total cost"" is zero dollars. But TD says my ""cost"" is $8000. ($200 x 40)

This is baffling me. 

I probably am putting too much thought into this LOL I mean, I know I can sell those 200 share right now at any price and be out with a profit."

stocks,"[CNBC] Oatly accused of overstating revenue and greenwashing by activist short Spruce Point   

**Oatly accused of overstating revenue and greenwashing by activist short Spruce Point**

· Activist short seller Spruce Point Capital Management has accused Oatly of shady accounting practices and greenwashing.

· The firm alleges that Oatly has overstated both its revenue and margins to investors.

· Oatly made its U.S. public market debut in late May, giving it a market value of $13 billion.

· According to S3 Partners, about 1% of Oatly’s float, or the number of shares available on the market, is being shorted, as of Tuesday.

Activist short seller Spruce Point Capital Management has accused Oatly of shady accounting practices and misleading consumers and investors about its sustainability practices.

The firm, which has taken a short position against the maker of oat milk, called for Oatly’s board to hire an independent forensic accountant to open an investigation into its claims.

The stock, which was down nearly 3% in premarket trading before the news, fell 6%.

Oatly was founded in Sweden in the 1990s but didn’t reach the U.S. until five years ago. Since then, it’s contributed to the surging demand for oat-based milk substitutes, primarily among coffee drinkers, and made its U.S. public market debut about two months ago. The stock is up 4.5% since its initial public offering, giving it a market value of $12.5 billion, as of Tuesday’s close.

However, Spruce Point’s report claims that Oatly misled investors by omitting or manipulating key facts in its prospectus and a June investor presentation and argues that the company will never achieve profitability. The report is expected to be published Wednesday morning.

“We don’t think any of this is in the narrative at the moment,” Spruce Point founder and Chief Investment Officer Ben Axler said in an interview. “We think this is a strong sell, and the stock price could be 70% overvalued.”

Axler has previously taken short positions against other consumer packaged goods companies, like Church &amp; Dwight and Boulder Brands. Short sellers borrow shares and then sell them, betting that the stock will fall. According to S3 Partners, about 1% of Oatly’s float, or the number of shares available on the market, is being shorted, as of Tuesday.

When reached by CNBC, an Oatly spokesperson didn’t have an immediate response to Spruce Point’s allegations.

Accounting allegations

Spruce Point alleges that Oatly has overstated both its revenue and margins to investors.

The short seller’s report points to the company’s recent investor presentation, which showed estimated 2018 U.S. revenue of $12 million. The firm said that both Nielsen and Umgas Magazine, a Swedish publication, reported that Oatly’s net U.S. sales were just $6 million in 2018.

Spruce Point also cited the company’s filings with Companies House, the U.K. agency that stores information on limited companies.

“We observe periods of large divergence in revenue and accounts receivable growth rates at Oatly,” the report said. “This is a classic sign of potential accounting shenanigans and is often cited as a top red flag to predict accounting scandals.”

Additionally, Spruce Point alleges that Oatly is overstating its gross margin. The company does not include outbound shipping and handling costs in its calculations, and fails to disclose that its gross profit presentation is not comparable to that of other food companies. The report alleges that Oatly’s gross margin is actually 6.4% lower when logistics and shipping are factored in.

The firm also claimed to find anomalies about Oatly’s capital expenditures between its cash flow statement and additions to the balance sheet.

Spruce Point argued that the company hasn’t been transparent with investors about key figures involved in its accounting and auditing. For example, Oatly has allegedly run through three auditors in six years, a fact that was not disclosed in its filings to go public.

“From our experience this is highly unusual,” the report said. ”... While auditor rotations can be viewed positively, we believe three auditors in six years is excessive in light of the accounting anomalies we have identified related to sales, gross margins, inventories and capex.”

Oatly’s current auditor is Ernst &amp; Young, according to a recent filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

The report noted that Chief Financial Officer Christian Hanke’s biography on the company’s investor relations website does not make note of his role as the manager of financial reporting for Stratus Technologies from 1999 to 2005. During that time, the company had to restate its financial results for fiscal 2004 and the first quarter of fiscal 2005. Hanke does disclose the job on his LinkedIn page.

Additionally, Oatly appointed Frances Rathke as chair of its audit committee. In her time as chief financial officer, treasurer and chief accounting officer of Green Mountain Coffee Roasters, the SEC investigated the company’s accounting practices, forcing the company to restate its financial results. Rathke’s biography on Oatly’s website does not include her former role as the coffee company’s chief accounting officer. Her LinkedIn page details her time with the company.

Claims of greenwashing

Oatly has also branded itself as a more sustainable option than cow’s milk or other nondairy alternatives to both consumers and investors. But Spruce Point alleges that the company has been giving a misleading impression of its green credentials, which is known as greenwashing, and putting its global expansion ahead of its mission.

Among the examples it cites is the company’s June 2021 presentation to investors, which uses data based on a 2013 study that was updated three years later. The data does not include the impact of the company’s expansion into Asia or the United States.

Spruce Point also alleges that Oatly has cherry picked the data by omitting that its water consumption is higher than that of making cow’s milk. The company’s 2019 sustainability report also showed that its New Jersey plant was using 55% more water for every liter of oat base than its facilities in Sweden and the Netherlands.

For several quarters, the New Jersey facility has been out of compliance with the Environmental Protection Agency, the report said. The EPA’s website does not identify what the violation or violations are.

Moreover, the hedge fund obtained documents through a Freedom of Information Act request to Millville, New Jersey that showed issues with the plant’s wastewater in 2019, but the company has not yet opened a wastewater treatment facility.

“They’ve had very high levels of wastewater as a byproduct, but they’ve known since 2019, and they’re still in the process of dealing with that,” Axler said.

The report also points to Oatly’s transportation as a major source of its environmental impact. According to Spruce Point, the company sources its oats from Western Canada and then ships them to its facility in New Jersey. For its expansion into Asia, Oatly is sourcing its oats from Sweden."

stocks,"What was the biggest mistake you have made or which crash effected you the most? What did we learn from it? Are we a better trader? Thoughts I have been trading since my Birthday in 1994. (late 1994) I have seen so many things happen in my time of trading. The Dot Com Crash of 2000, the financial meltdown due to mortgages in 2008 and the 2 month correction in 2020 caused by Covid 19. Many traders, especially retail, and on Reddit are probably new and came in after May of 2020. Some have come with Meme craze in late January, so it is important to hear the stories from others so that we can try and gather a perspective if what we have done was bad, or were more worse horror stories.

From 1995 until late 1999 the market was absolutely amazing! In 1996-1997 I finally got internet, dial up AOL 4.0! At that time it made trading and investing much easier. Before that time I would write in a daily journal closing and opening prices for 2-3,000 stocks, daily!!!! Computers were 3-5,000 back then for a very good one and I was a kid! The Dial up US robotics 56K modem was $300.

This last paragraph was very important because with the internet and checking www dot com sites we all thought it was revolutionary. My biggest mistake, also humbled me and taught me many valuable lessons. Pre 1997-1998 I was calling my broker over the phone and paying $50 per trade. I was trading mainly blue chip stocks, on the DOW and SP....... As I came alone and did research....I started to do what we all did in 98-2000. Instead of looking at fundamentals, even sales!!! We started buying stocks based on the clicks of the website!! Yes, that is right! Insane, but right! Sites like Etoys where I lost $50,000 would publish daily or weekly clicks. Based on the clicks the stocks would take fire.... 

In the year 2000, the Nasdaq which was about 5,000 stocks as an index dropped 83% off the peak....I lost over 75% of my money... It was very humbling for myself. It taught me many lessons.

You should buy in increments, blocks if you decide to buy the same stock. (I had 1,000 shares of PCLN at 85 and sold at 9 \[loss of 76,000\] PCLN dropped to 1.50.... It is now BKNG and 2,200\] that is another story!

Diversify! I thought I diversified by buying a ton of tech all in similar fields and sectors. It was a complete dot com bust!

Fundamentals! Do not buy a company with no sales!! No earnings! Negative cash flow! They are going to take on new debt or sell you shares to raise cash!

Lastly, no matter who we are, or how great we were, a crash can happen to anyone! From 1995-2000 I was taking unbelievable and insane risks. My gains were absolutely epic, then I lost 75% off the highs from I believe March - May 2000.

Please share or thoughts so we can all engage. Also, so that new traders see this is not so bad at the moment!"

This retracement is largely due to investors believing revenue guidance for 2021 was overstated based on December 2020 Q4 revenues of 4M. LMPX has since reported stellar Q1 earnings and drastically increased its guidance and earnings however there has been manipulation on this stock and has been heavily shorted since its June 29th earnings release.

LMPX is extremely undervalued compared to its peers, it has the fastest growing revenues. Only company with increasing margins, and improving EBIDTA and net income. This does not factor their protentional pipeline growth which aims to exceed 5B in revenues by 2024.

**Used Auto Market Growth:**

The used car market is booming, making it a perfect time for resellers. The shortage of new cars as a result of the global chip prices has demand for used cars surging.

Used car prices have jumped 21 percent since April 2020 and 10% of that came directly during April 2021.

This factor alone should drastically increase guidance for 2021 above the 910 forecast. April price jumps and demand surge will be reflected in next quarters earnings. As car prices continue to increase LMPX will start to make more profit on each vehicle while Gross profit % stays the same.

**Key Acquisitions and Business Moves:**

LMPX has been making key acquisitions over the last few months which will help play into the bottom line.

**LMPX Acquisitions:**

Hometown Subaru - May 2021

2 Dodge/Chrysler Dealerships - April 2021

Bachman Bernard Chevy Buick Dealership - April 2021

New Ecommerce Website - March 2021

LTO Holdings Acquisition - February 2021

Atlantic Auto Group Acquisition - February 2021

Landed 660M syndicate credit line for use of Acquisitions - January 2021

LMPX started off the year with a bang and secured 660m of credit to use towards acquisition's. Which has been put to use over the first 5 months, purchasing multiple auto groups and dealerships. Securing backlogs of inventory and entering into new markets throughout the U.S. These acquisitions will be even more profitable with the recent 10% surge in used car prices in April 2021.

**Refinancing / Dividend and Share Buy Back:**

Last week LMPX announced the approval of debt refinancing, aiming to secure additional capital, refinance at a lower rate and pay down current balances at a faster rate.

Why is LMPX refinancing? LMPX is currently operating at a 18m per quarter cash surplus from operations. LMPX expects their cash balance to exceed 50m by ending quarter 4 after factoring current debt obligations:

Q2 Cash Balance : 25.1M

Q4 Cash Balance : 50.0M

Increase : 24.9M

Current Debt : 11.25M

Net cash flow Q3/Q4: 36.15 or running at a 18m surplus each quarter.

This is prior to refinancing their debts to a lower interest rate. With their current run rate and financial strength they will be able to acquire a larger credit/loan facility at a improved rates to make further dealership acquisitions.

**Dividend Announcement:** LMPX announced that it will be issuing a dividend prior to Q4 for 15% of its excess cash balance back to the shareholders. This is an attempt to attract institutional ownership and to show a sign of strength of their financials.

**Expected Dividend:**

15% of 36M = 5.4M

Shares O/S = 10.04M = 52cents a share or 3.4% Dividend

**Share Buy Back:** LMPX will also be doing a share buyback amounting to 25% of the excess cash (36M)

The CEO (SAM) has stated numerous times that this stock is undervalued, at this current time he will be using excess company money to buyback shares at this suppressed share price to combat the market manipulation that is going on with the stock right now. Shares will be bought up over the course of the next 6 months when excess cash arises.

**Shares to be acquired:**

25% of 36M = 9M

Total Shares = 9M/$14.98 = 600k Shares or 6% of total outstanding shares

**Short Activity and Market Manipulation:**

The price action on LMPX is currently being manipulated by a short.

LMPX recorded recorded revenue growth, increasing margins and increased Q2 and annual guidance.

The stock closed down 4% on the day after being up 21% during premarket.

Since then the stock has dropped another 14%.

This is all while the CEO has announced share buy backs, increasing cash positions, debt refinancing and dividends. He has also hired senior management and appointed a CEO.

**Short Volume Ratio:**

Over the last 10 trading days the stock has averaged a 35% short volume ratio, with short volume ratio amounting to up to 46% on some days. The normal short volume ratio for most companies lands in the 10-20% range. Even stocks that are targets of high short interest such as AMC and GME are in the mid 20% range.

The Short controlling the price action shorts shares each morning around 945-1030 if the market is rallying to kill momentum and dumps into any market sell off. Only on occasions when retail does decide to sell do they cover small positions. Since June 30th they have been significantly increasing their short open interest. The short controlling the price is coming from the ADF venue and has not been buying into the ask for more then 10% of its total shares shorted during each session.

**Short Interest:**

As of June 30th the stock has a short interest of 534k, Shorts covered a large portion of their shares prior to the earnings on June 29th. The stock ran from 15$ to 18.93$ prior to earnings on their coverings and covered roughly 120k shares. The subsequently shorted 100k shares over the next couple days to kill momentum and cause the stock to sell off. Since then they have completely controlled the stocks price action running it from the high of 21$ premarket on June 30th to as low as 12.86 on July 8th. Since then we have had multiple positive Earnings releases and yet we are still trading below pre earnings share price. Current short interest is sitting in the 700k-740k range which represents roughly 12% of the tradeable float.

If the short covers its 700k shares currently sold short we can expect a rally of 6-10$. Covering of 150k shares sent this from 15-19$ prior to earnings release. The short will have a impossible time trying to cover shares with the current volume. Institutions have not sold any shares since February and have added shares since. Retail holders with large positions know the protentional this stock has.

**Float:**

LMPX currently has 10.01m shares outstanding of which 4m are owned directly by management/insiders. Making the tradeable float roughly 6m soon to be 5.4m after the share buy back. The lower the float means the quicker the price moves. Institutional holdings is low but I expect it to drastically increase after next earnings report in August where the company will be reporting 150m revenue and EBITDA of 10m+ and Net income in the 8M range.

**Future Catalysts:**

**Dealership Acquisitions:** Sam stated that the large NYC dealership acquisition will be completed prior to end of Q3 (Sept). This dealership will bring in over 270m annually (2020 figures) expecting closer to 320m at current growth rate and market. It will also be bringing in 5m of Net income (2020 figures) expecting closer to 8m with margins increasing across the board and auto prices soaring. Once this acquisition is complete we will be nearing the 1B annual revenue run rate. Sam will also be acquiring other dealerships as opportunities arise.

**Refinancing Announcement:** Once refinancing is secured, LMPX will be operating with a improved bottom line and more flexibility to acquiring new dealerships and increasing their growth. The dividend and share buy back dates will be announced once refinancing has been obtained. I expect management to be actively shopping rates for the next couple of weeks and a announcement locked in before Earnings in August.

**Q2 Earnings:** LMPX is set to report earnings in August, this will be their first profitable quarter (net income). They will be reporting revenue of 148m (348% growth from prior quarter), EBITDA of 10.3M+ and Net income of over 8M. Analysts will start covering this stock and value investors will be attracted to its earnings ratios compared to its peers. I am expecting them to update us on multiple new dealership acquisitions in the pipeline and increase revenue guidance to 1B for next year.

**Summary:**

LMPX absolutely crushed quarter 1 with revenues of 33M tomorrow representing a 725% increase from prior quarter. Guidance for quarter 2 (confirmed as quarter 2 ends tomorrow) increased by 348% to 148M. This will bring back investors who dumped their shares after the CEO was called out for ""overstating guidance"". New investors will be drawn in from the quarter over quarter growth reported on the call. The recent boom in used auto prices and demand will further excel LMPX as a market leader.

If LMPX continues to exceed revenues estimates and obtain 910M+ revenue for 12 months ending Q2 2022 its fair value compared to its peers should be at $400+ a share using price to sales metrics or 107$ using a Price to earnings ratio.

LMPX is currently a cash generating machine and has announced a share buyback and dividend with its excess cash to try and attract new investors and bolster its undervalued share price compared to its peers.

The CEO has been actively releasing press releases over the last week to try and trap the short who is currently controlling the price. There are many catalysts coming before the August earnings report at which point this stock should be trading in the 30s."
stocks,"This is a posting regarding r/AMCStock &amp; Robinhood So I joined the investing world not too long ago, maybe 2 months now not sure. Used Robinhood cause it's what I was familiar with the most and I joined the AMC train around the $40 mark, but im extremely poor the most I could afford was 3 stocks at most, making very little from the stock due to the massive manipulation by hedge funds and SEC/Government letting it all happen.

Then I hear Robinhood is garbage and even if the short squeeze happens (if it ever does) I might not even get what I should get cause of Robinhood 's corrupt nature

I don't know what to do anymore, I can't afford to keep buying shares when it doesn't go anywhere soon enough, and now I can't even trust Robinhood when/if a squeeze happens

It's hard to deal with this, and my confidence is at an all time low in the US stock market"
stocks,"Can the market return to pre-pandemic 2020 levels? Looking at some technical charts, comparing now to the Pre-March “pandemic “ lows,  the S&amp;P is about 40% higher.   Pre-pandemic we had a record low 2.5% unemployment rate, low inflation, and a 1% interest rate.  Present day we have 5.5% unemployment, high inflation, 0% rates.  

My question is, do you think after all the government stimulus, bank loans, mortgage backed securities wear off,  could we return to pre-pandemic “normal” earnings levels, which would constitute a 30-50% loss in major indexes?  I’m contemplating at least taking 50% and sitting in a money market earning 2%.  Yes, inflation does hurt, but losing 30-40% of a portfolio to a recession in the next couple years is much worse."
stocks,"Spectrum Brands (SPB) Spectrum Brands seems like an overlooked gem. There's almost no discussion on Reddit for them and the Yahoo Finance message board for them is dead.

They're a consumer products home essentials company with multiple brands to their name that cover several different areas of life (lock sets, pet care, insecticides, grooming and shaving, etc). I'm certain they have at least one brand that you've heard of. 

They currently have a PE of just under 12 and a forward PE of just over 12. EPS this year, next year, and next 5 years are all very positive. P/FCF is 12.5, and instititional ownersip over 99%. 

1 yr price targets are around $100-$110 with a share price right now of $79.  They also pay a healthy 2% dividend.  I see them as a dividend play, a growth stock, and a value stock. Yet no one seems to notice them. 

The price has been falling lately, I assume due to inflation concerns and CPI news, but I think that'll only help them. They produce products that everyone needs. Even if cost of living increases, people will still buy their products. 

So, any thoughts on SPB? Is the falling stock price a concern? Or a great buying opportunity? If you've never heard of them, now that you have what do you think?"
stocks,"The benefits and drawbacks of share repurchases Generally when I see share repurchases, I waste no time and conclude that it is a positive action made by the company.  But after spending some time thinking about it and doing some research, I’m less sure that this is always the case.

Benefits of share repurchases:

* Generally a signal that management thinks the company is undervalued, especially but not exclusively if repurchases are uncommon
* If the company issues stock options as compensation, they can repurchase shares and use that when the employee exercises their options.  
* Repurchases can be used to remove overhanging stock, that is when there is a large portion of stock that has flooded or is about to flood the market, the company can repurchase the outstanding stock to prevent or bring up the share price, or just to scoop up some stock at a lower than usual price.  
* It indirectly offers more choice to the shareholders compared to dividends.  If the number of shares decreases under normal conditions, the shareholder has the option to hold the stock or sell it and pay taxes realizing the capital gain, whereas with dividends, the shareholder has no choice but to accept the dividends and pay taxes on them.
* In times of temporary prosperity, management may be reluctant to increase dividends because it would look unfavorable when they have to decrease them after.  Instead, if they buyback shares this adds similar value but carries with it less expectation to be consistent.  
* This point ties in with the one above.  If a firm compensates shareholders with both repurchases and dividends, then the firm has a cushion of share repurchases that can increase or decrease while dividends stay the same.
* The obvious fact that repurchases increase the value per share and that price per share generally follows.

Drawbacks of share repurchases:

* The company could pay too high a price for shares
* Some shareholders prefer dividends to share repurchases
* The company may repurchase shares even when there are better alternatives for its capital allocation
* Share buybacks can be used to manipulate per-share figures 
* Buybacks could be used just to reduce dilution from massive compensation in the form of stock or options

In my opinion, a divide between consistent dividends and share repurchases is the most attractive option as long as the firm is not disregarding its own obligations and better uses of capital. 

I hope you get something out of this and I am eager to hear about things that I missed."

I hear of people who’ve been sitting in cash the past year “waiting for the drop” now have to make a move or take a haircut on their spending power. That only has to be good if people are putting their cash to work. 

All the people who want to sell out and ride it out don’t really have that option at this point. We’ll see where we’re at in a year but my gut tells me there won’t be any serious correction (20%+) anytime soon.

stocks,"Can someone justify the current price of AMD in comparison to intel? Full disclosure: I'm an AMD fanboy. I have been AMD fanboy since 2013. My last PC was full AMD build and my current PC is full AMD build. I love AMD. My only regret was not getting into stocks 5 years ago. I would have happily brought AMD when they were 10usd per stock. :P

But I do not own stock in intel nor AMD. At least, not yet. All my funds are tied up else where.

Now, if you haven't been following PC hardware news. AMD has been killing it with their ryzen series. That launched in 2016. Their current gen hardware is better intel by power and price. PC enthusiasts absolutely love the ryzen series. You can clearly see this on tech side of youtube. Top of that, AMD secured partnership with gaming consoles. All good stuff, right?

Meanwhile, before 2016. Intel was considered the KING. They have connections everywhere throughout the technology world. Intel is known for quality. But now with the release of AMD's ryzen series. They're no longer the king with PC enthusiasts. But Intel still has strong connections with other companies. Their business model has raked in A LOT of money. And they're currently sitting on a lot of money.

Intel has less debt than AMD.

What I don't understand is why AMD is sitting at 90usd and intel is sitting at 56usd.(as of today) The price different is staggering considering both companies have done really well because of the pandemic. Many people brought new desktop and laptops to work from home or school. (Myself included)

Now, you might say.

Well, the ryzen series is why there is a huge price difference.

And yeah, that's a fair point. Intel is currently on their back heels, they're currently being forced to cut prices on products just to compete. But even with price cuts, intel has big price margins. So they're still making money even with price reductions. I would value the AMD 10usd higher than Intel just for that reason. Not 40usd difference.

But AMD has GPU too!

Very true. And AMD GPU have been selling extremely well because of the pandemic. But only because of the pandemic. Their competitor, Nvidia. Has dominated the GPU market for decades. And Nvidia's current generation of cards, RTX 30xx series. Is currently the most desired GPU card on the market. Not just by gamers, but also crypto miners. If there wasn't a global chip shortage or scalpers. PC enthusiasts would buy Nvidia cards right now. (myself included.)

Now, does that still jusify AMD's current price? I don't think so. According to steam hardware surveys.

https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/

Intel has 70% of CPU market place. There appears to be a slight tread downwards in market share. But intel is still owns 70% after 5 years of AMD's Ryzen series reigning supreme.

Top of that, AMD only owns 15% of the GPU market. While Nvidia almost 80% of the market. And crazy enough, intel own 8% of market! That's half of what AMD's market.

So why is AMD at 90usd? While intel sits at 56usd. I believe AMD's current price was driven by an influx of new traders in 2020.

I honestly believe AMD is overpriced and not worth 90usd. I don't have any target prices for intel or AMD. I'm not that smart. But my gut would say, Both companies should be closer in value. Both companies should be around the 50-70usd mark.

My reasoning is, intel still has a lot of potential to come back. They dominated the CPU market for a reason. The only reason why they let AMD take off, they got lazy. They didn't try to make better products. They just made slight improvements and kept their high pricing. Only focusing on generating more revenue than innovations. They currently had a change in leadership and their current CEO is an engineer. In the 1980's, he helped designed the architecture for the Intel 80486 processor. So he clearly has knowledge in intel's products.

While in contrast, when AMD switched their CEO to Lisa Su (who is also an IT engineer) in 2014. We saw the birth of AMD's ryzen series, two years later.

So it is safe to assume, that Intel will make a come back with their CPUs in the coming years with new leadership."

Being green at this, I was wondering if anyone has gotten involved in a stock where a planned reverse split was coming. 

Is there a way to take advantage of this?

Is acquisition for the purpose of talent acquisition, or “acquihiring,” an effective approach?
In technology, you might be purchasing a company for the customers, or the revenue, or the patents, but frequently it’s also for the talent. All acquisitions involve stress for the people involved, but an acquisition for talent is one of the best-case scenarios. You can stand up in front of the employees and say, “There are no plans to disrupt your work. We want to keep everything running smoothly and you shouldn’t notice any difference.”"

stocks,"Thoughts on use of moving stop-limit orders to protect gains? **Summary**:
Set stop-limit SELL orders at a threshold below the market price; where the threshold is low enough to be touched in case of a sustained market downturn e.g. due to COVID, and beyond normal price fluctuations. The stop and limit prices will be adjusted every week so as to maintain the same _distance_ from the market price.

Of course, this can be applied to stocks as well.

**Example**:
Set the STP-LMT price of an S&amp;P 500 ETF to 2% below the week-ending market price. The S&amp;P 500 would likely fall by 2% only when the market suffers a sustained downturn. At this point, my ETFs sell, I keep my gains - 2%, and I can re-invest when I feel the market has stabilised.
If the price does not fall to the -2% level that week then next week I update the order.

Backstory:
As part of my medium and long -term, I have and will invest in ETFs of market indices and sectors (e.g. VanEck’s ETF of semi-conductors)."

Jerome Powell speaks tomorrow, and I think if there’s any inflation scare that should be good for Costco.

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Tuesday, July 13, 2021 **PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, July 13, 2021**

Today was quite action-packed, with both the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) once again recording a fresh intraday high for the second time this week before turning lower towards the end of the session. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, performed the worst, falling 1.75% at the time of writing. Market participants are digesting the beginning of Q2 earning season and a new report that showed in June, consumer prices have surged by the most since 2008.

The Labor Department’s June Consumer Price Index (CPI), which measures changes in the prices of consumer goods, rose 0.9% in June, accelerating from May’s 0.6%. Year-on-year, the CPI is up 5.4%, exceeding the 4.9% expected by economists and the fastest rate of growth since 2008. Core CPI, which excludes the volatile price energy and food and is therefore considered a more accurate representation of general price inflation, was up 4.5% year-on-year as prices bounced from last year’s pandemic-era lows.

While the CPI print is not ideal, the market’s somewhat muted reaction (though there was a little volatility) seems to confirm that market participants are increasingly pricing in higher-than-expected inflationary data and are buying into the Federal Reserve’s argument that current pressures are transitory and due to pandemic-related disruptions. Moreover, it is very important to consider that current inflationary data is calculated on a year-on-year basis, so base effects are very much inflating the current numbers. In other words, inflationary readings are high because they are being measured using numbers from June 2020 when prices across the board collapsed as lockdowns and social distancing policies were implemented across the world. As I have said many times in the past, I am personally not yet worried about current inflationary pressures translating into a prolonged cycle of higher prices, though one always has to acknowledge the risks in the market and be prepared to act. 

In other news, Q2 earnings seasons kicked off today, with two of the largest banks in the US, JP Morgan Chase (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS) both reporting today, as well as Pepsi (PEP). JP Morgan, which is often considered a bellwether for the US economy given its sheer size, reported great results, driven in part by the release of $3 billion the bank had set aside to protect against potential losses from default loans during the pandemic, a sign that consumers held up better than the bank expected. JPM recorded revenues of $31.4 billion and profits of $11.948 billion, a staggering improvement from profits of $4.687 billion a year ago. One downside from the earnings report is a sharp reduction in revenues produced from trading, which is not surprising given the insane run by the market in 2020. 

This quarter, earnings for companies in the SPY are expected to grow by 64% year-on-year, according to FactSet, which would mark the fastest rate of earnings growth since the fourth quarter of 2009, when the US was emerging from the 11.948 housing-bubble induced recession. 

A big part of the strong Q2 earnings growth is easy comparisons to Q2 2020, a period that represented the bottom of the Covid-19 earnings impact. But Q2 2021 estimates also reflect genuine growth, with total index earnings expected to be up +8.8% compared to the pre-Covid 2019 Q2 period. In other words, even when compared to an earnings season 2 years ago, well before the coronavirus pandemic, this earnings season is expected to show very strong growth. Estimates for Q2 and beyond have been steadily going up, with the current +60.5% earnings growth rate up from +50.6% at the end of March and +41.6% at the start of January 2021.

Goldman Sachs strategist David Kosting said that market participants should focus on three questions heading into this earnings season: (1) How will companies deal with rising material costs and supply chain disruptions? (2) How are companies planning to prioritize cash spending? (3) How will companies deal with policy uncertainties, especially surrounding a potential tax hike?

In addition to earnings season, market participants are also looking forward to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell giving his semi-annual Monetary Policy Report to Congress Wednesday and Thursday of this week. Analysts are expecting Powell to once again strike a dovish tone (meaning unlikely to take aggressive action against inflation and instead favor employment), given the mixed June Job Report, which saw a better than expected number of jobs added to the economy but the unemployment rate tick higher and last week’s meeting minutes which showed an increasing divide between members regarding the timeline to begin tapering quantitative easing. In my view, Powell is trying to do three things in the upcoming meeting: (1) reiterate his view that the recovery of the economy is not yet complete, (2) inflation is a result of pandemic-era disruptions, and (3) prevent a repeat of the 2013 Taper Tantrum, a unwarranted, silly, collective market-panic that triggered a spike in U.S. Treasury yields after investors learned that the Federal Reserve was slowly putting the brakes on its quantitative easing program passed during the height of the 2008-09 recession. Moving ahead, further economic reports on consumer price inflation and retail sales out this week are expected to once again underscore that the pace of economic recovery in the US remains limited by supply chain disruptions and labor market imbalances.

**Highlights**

* Shares of Disney (DIS) outperformed the market again today thanks to the great success of Marvel’s “Black Widow”, which generated $80 billion in theater sales and $60 billion in streaming sales, the best domestic opening for a movie since the pandemic began. 
* Tesla (TSLA) Chief Executive Elon Musk defended the electric-vehicle maker's purchase of SolarCity Corp. in court, telling a Delaware judge that he didn't act improperly during the negotiating process. This comes in response to a lawsuit filed by TSLA shareholders that allege Musk forced the company to buy SolarCity, a solar-cell manufacturer, in order to save his investment in the company.
* Netflix and Universal have reached a licensing deal that will see more Universal movies, including animated pictures from DreamWorks, available on its streaming platform. 
* Despite successfully completing the company's first trip with Richard Branson as a passenger, shares of Virgin Galactic (SPCE) remain under pressure after the company announced it planned to take advantage of the elevated stock price by selling $500 million in stock, with the stock down roughly 25% from Friday’s prices. 
* Broadcom (AVGO) is reportedly in talks to buy the SAS Institute, a software company with upwards of $3 billion a year in revenue in a deal valued between $15-$20 billion. This is yet another acquisition by one of the world’s largest semiconductor companies.
* Microsoft (MSFT) announced it was acquiring cybersecurity firm RiskIQ to help reduce risk amid “the increasing sophistication and frequency of cyberattacks”.
* SolarWinds says that unknown hackers exploited a previously unknown flaw in two of its programs to go after ""a limited, targeted set of customers."" The company went on to say the hack was “completely unrelated” to last year’s attack” and that the company was still “unaware of the identity of the potentially affected customers”. Seems like hackers find it easy to attack this company.

stocks,"Meet TATTOOED CHEF. The Growth Stock You've Never Heard Of. \*I Am Reposting With Some New Information After Today's Big Announcement\*

I don't like to take risks in the stock market. But when I do, I want the odds to be in my favor. If I am investing in a growth stock, I want to see returns of 15% annually (Double Up In Five Years) When it comes to this company, I believe we have potential for both long-term and short-potential. In this post, I am going to break down everything I know about this company and explain why it is my largest position in my portfolio. Grab your crayons folks and follow along.

# INTRODUCTION

Here is a quick run down of Tattooed Chef and what they do. They are a food company selling frozen foods products in the freezer isle at major grocery outlets. Products are plant based to take advantage of vegan, vegetarian, and plant based food trends. While products are sold in the United States, production takes place in Italy. Production costs are much cheaper overseas and allows for higher margins here in the U.S. TTCF is vertically integrated allowing for greater control of product quality and adaptation. It's a new age food company clicking on all cylinders and picking up steam competing against companies of yesteryear.

# Revenue Growth For TTCF

This company is growing like a BEAST. Here's some of the numbers from 2017 and on.

2017 Revenue ---------------- **$32.5 Million**

2018 Revenue ---------------- **$47.9 Million (+47.4%)**

2019 Revenue----------------- **$84.9 Million (+77.2%)**

2020 Revenue----------------  **$148.5 Million (+74.9%)**

2021 Revenue (Projected) **$239.3 Million (+61.1%)**

2022 Revenue (Projected) **$323.0 Million (+35.0%)**

# The Growth Number EVERYONE Is Ignoring

The growth numbers up top seem impressive right? Well this is a case where just top line revenues do not tell the whole story. TTCF sells ""Tattooed Chef"" branded products as well as some private label products. What are some of the most valuable assets in the world? Loyal brands. Tattooed Chef realizes this and for the last few years they have been solely focused on its core brand rather than private label deals. Why does Coca Cola dominate the drink space for decades? Because the brand is globally recognized and it's a product people trust. Is TTCF there yet? No. Will it ever get there? Maybe. But so far they are on the right track to do so.

&amp;#x200B;

HERE ARE THE GROWTH NUMBERS FOR **ONLY** TTCF LABELED PRODUCTS

&amp;#x200B;

FULL YEAR 2019 - **$18.3 Million**

FULL YEAR 2020 - **$84.6 Million (363% Increase!!!)**

&amp;#x200B;

2020 3rd Quarter - **$22.6 Million (Year-Over-Year Increase of 288%)**

2020 4th Quarter - **$23.9 Million (Year-Over-Year Increase of 172%)**

2021 1st Quarter - **$36.0 Million (Year-Over-Year Increase of 105%)**

&amp;#x200B;

As you can see, branded revenue is what is really important for this company. The CEO himself has publicly stated that private label revenue over time will be 'phased out'. In my opinion, private label revenue is mostly irrelevant with this growth story. While 50%, 60%, and 70% revenue growth may be impressive, the numbers that really matter, (branded products) are growing well over 100% year-over-year.

# Earnings &amp; Profitability Potential

The CEO and founder of the company (see information below) has had a long history of running food businesses. Before running public companies, the businesses were ran to feed his family and live a prosperous life. So, Tattooed Chef is ran with the intention of being profitable **AND** growing rapidly. For a company in its early growth stages, this is very rare. Most businesses, regardless of the industry, typically lose money hand over fist. The fast cash burn usually requires companies in these early growth stages to take on debt and issue additional shares. This usually leads to weaker balance sheets and diluted long-term shareholder value. For Tattooed Chef this is not the case. Shareholder dilution is unlikely and debt is unnecessary for the **ALREADY** profitable business. I doubt long term debt will accumulate unless a large acquisition is made.

So far, TTCF has produced minimal profits. This is mainly due to them reinvesting virtually all profits back into the business for further growth. The chart is more accurate for results from late 2019 and early 2020. The chart is unfortunately skewed heavily in the last few quarters due to a large tax benefit (changing from S corporation to C corporation) and other things such as the recent acquisition. (More on that later. But, as you can see, the company can make money **AND** grow revenue for their flagship ""Tattooed Chef"" branded products &gt;100%.

The hardest part of this analysis is trying to determine future profitability. While profits are growing, it is hard to know what type of net income and EPS numbers this company will be doing in 2026. In the chart below, revenue is expected to reach $1.0 Billion annually in 2026. Forecasts this far out can sometimes be a far cry from actual results. But, in this case I believe it is an attainable number by 2026. The big question here is... How much of that will turn into profit?

Food businesses generally have lower margins. Once again, trying to forecast net income for a company like this in 2026 is very difficult. But, we will use an assumption of 10% of revenue turning into net income in 2026. Margins will be higher for TTCF versus competitors such as Tyson Foods (See Below). A Tyson Foods for example, generally turns \~5% into net income. TTCF could make 10% an attainable number in the next five years.

So assuming 10% into net income out of $1.0 Billion in revenue, that means net income would be an assumed $100 Million in 2026. Here are valuation/stock price estimates based on those profitability estimates. The stock currently currently trades at almost exactly $20.00 as of the time of writing at 07/10/2021

**Lower End - 2026 PE Ratio of 20 - Market Cap of $2.0 Billion - Stock Price of \~$24.40**

**The Middle - 2026 PE Ratio of 25 - Market Cap of $2.5 Billion - Stock Price of \~$30.51**

**Higher End - 2026 PE Ratio of 30 - Market Cap of $3.0 Billion - Stock Price of \~$36.61**

# CEO Sam Galletti &amp; Creative Director Sarah Galletti

The CEO is basically a veteran in regards to the food industry. He seems pretty credible and hard working. Rather than give my personal take on someone's character and ability to perform, it would probably be best to do your own due diligence on the CEO. But, from what I can tell, he seems to be a good leader/founder of the company. His daughter Sarah his literally is ""The Tattooed Chef"" is the face behind the company. She creates, designs, alters, etc. mostly all of TTCF's products. Here is their website posting information about the two.

# VALUATION

Tattooed Chef currently trades at a market cap of $1.65 Billion. For a growth company at this stage, P/S ratio likely a better metric to use in terms of valuation rather than P/E ratio. Here are the numbers for 2021 and 2022.

**2021 P/S Ratio - 6.89**

**2022 P/S Ratio - 5.11**

This company is trading at 5 times next years revenue. Considering the growth trajectory moving forward, I would consider this to have considerable value. The company also has $185 Million in cash. Considering this very large cash pile (relative to the company's size) it makes the company's market cap a bit more attractive.

# MERGERS &amp; ACQUISITIONS

In May of this year, Tattooed Chef announced the acquisition New Mexico Food Distributors, Inc. and Karsten Tortilla Factory. This acquisition was approximately $35 Million. The company still has $185 Million in cash (as of the last earnings report). This leaves lots of room for further expansions and acquisitions.

While only $35 Million was spent, a significant amount of revenue will be generated from this acquisition. ""We will be immediately addressing the $1 billion Frozen Mexican Food category once the transactions close. At full capacity, we believe Foods of New Mexico can contribute up to $200 million annually in revenue in the next two to three years and create significant value for all our stakeholders.""

$200 Million in annual revenue for only $35 Million? Sounds like a good deal to me.

# NEW DEAL WITH WHOLE FOODS

TTCF is in many large retailers already. Target, Walmart, Sam's Club, Costco, Whole Foods, etc. Many other big names are currently in the work as well. Whole Foods is there most recent big announcement in May of this year with two products being offered. The two products being offered are listed below.

# LEAKED INFORMATION ABOUT TTCF IN KROGER

Kroger is the 2nd largest grocer in the U.S. and a deal with Kroger could be MASSIVE for this company. Has a deal been announced yet? Nope. But I have some good news. I am in a discord chat full of other TTCF shareholders. It appears that (while it has not been publicly announced by Tattooed Chef) a soft launch of their products are being sold at a few Kroger locations. Photos and prices can be found listed online in certain areas of Kroger's website. Two different shareholders I have personally spoken to have been able to buy TTCF at Kroger locations. This would obviously be HUGE for TTCF if they are able to get this deal. While it may be unconfirmed for now, it seems to me that very soon a deal is inevitable. Here are some photos I was able to grab off of the Kroger website.

# UPDATED INFO FROM THIS MORNING

TTCF is not **OFFICIALLY** in Kroger. Two days ago when I posted this original post, it was all rumor and speculation. They will be fully launched two months from now in September. They will be in 1,800 Kroger locations with **12 DIFFERENT PRODUCTS!** This is huge news and the official press release is shown below.

# NEW PRODUCTS

This company is coming out with new products all of the time. It seems like every month new flavors and styles of food are announced. But you may be asking the question and saying... ""This is just a food company that sells stuff in the freezer isle. What's the big deal?"" Well the company is currently working on expanding past **JUST** the freezer isle. Plant-based tortillas are currently being talked about. Plant-based snacks are also scheduled to come out late 2021/early 2022. A new executive was just hired a few weeks ago who specializes in the snack industry. In the same way boring old PepsiCo was able to expand into dozens of brands and product styles, TTCF would be able to do the same **IF** they continue their success.

# MARKETING EXSPENSES/MARKETING STRATEGIES

Remember the massive growth numbers we talked about for ""Tattooed Chef"" branded products? Well until 2021, the budget for marketing and advertising TTCF products has been **$0.00**. Until this year, **100%** of their growth has been through their own making. **NOT** with a massive marketing budget. Small TV campaigns and mobile ads are being paid for as of the last few months. More importantly, brand ambassadors/influencers will also be sponsoring TTCF as well. Now that advertising will be impacting the company, I expect brand recognition to steadily increase.

# TARGET LAUNCH

**IN THE LAST QUARTERLY CONFERENCE CALL THE CEO STATED THAT TARGET CLAIMED TATTOOED CHEF WAS THE MOST SUCCESSFUL FROZEN FOOD LAUNCH IN THE HISTORY OF TARGET.** This is obviously huge for the company. Target is already a big deal for this company and this level of confidence from Target is exciting.

# BALANCE SHEET

Going over everything on a balance sheet would make this (already long) post even longer. But I have two main things on the balance sheet I would like to point out. Cash as of 03/31/2021 is $185 Million. Meanwhile, long term debt $1.9 Million. The company currently has almost no debt and is cash loaded. Considering this is a company which has $1.65 Billion market cap, $185 Million is a considerable amount of cash. So technically, the valuation of the company is over 10% strictly in cold, hard cash. This is very appealing.

# TAM OPPORTUNITY (Total Addressable Market)

The total addressable market for TTCF is very large. Virtually anyone who eats food (regardless of dietary lifestyle) are potential customers for TTCF. Plant based, vegan, and vegetarian diets are all growing in popularity (See Below). Plant based foods of had 13% compounded annual growth rate from 2017-2019. These numbers are expected to continue for the next decade.

# POTENTIAL RISKS FOR TTCF

Like all businesses, the company does have many risks. The company is in an extremely competitive market. The food industry will always have big money moving products in and out and competition will continue to be ruthless.

The many retailers TTCF has gotten into could give away the hard earned shelf space. This goes hand and hand with competition risks. If Target, Walmart, Costco, etc. finds a better product, TTCF is at risk of losing the valuable real estate of shelf space.

Sam and Sarah are the backbone of the company. The bulk of shares are owned by them and they are what makes the company the success that it is. If for whatever reason, they were to part ways with the company, it is questionable how successful this business would be.

I believe plant based diets are a trend, not a fad. But, if vegetarian/vegan/plant diets die off in popularity, then Tattooed Chef would likely begin to follow suit as well.

Low margins are kind of the norm for food based businesses. Low margins means less room for error. Profits will likely remain constrained to certain levels for the lifespan of the business.

Inflation has been a big talk in the markets recently and rising costs of raw materials for their products could rise. This could potentially hurt profitability.

Risk free rate of return drives valuation for all equity securities. The risk free rate of return is currently at rock bottom. If this were to change, then stocks with profits that are future oriented would likely see their valuation contract. TTCF falls into this category of valuation contraction.

stocks,"Risks associated with exploration companies TLDR: Most exploration companies are terrible.

This post reflects what I have found after looking at dozens of medium and smaller sized canadian and american exploration companies.  There are a few that look promising - they have some revenue coming in, some attractive operations, maybe even some earnings.  But more often than not, I come across some of these common attributes:

* There is no revenue, and a lot of losses
* They issue more stock each year to offset retained losses and keep liabilities low  
* They have optimistic content on their website, press releases, and anything excluding their finances.
* They may have a lot of assets relative to liabilities - mostly with assets acquired or cash generated as a direct result of huge share issuances.
* They have many years of unprofitable operations, and a history of rebranding.
* They sometimes own or claim land that has some legal, political, regulatory, locational,  or other type of problem.

I have heard that many of these companies are mentioned in social media, and I have seen them recommended in articles, as well as all over reddit.  

Take for example standard lithium ltd (TSXV:SLL).  They have no operations.  Zero.  They have been around for 23 years and still don’t have any actual operations.  If you look at their balance sheet two things pop out at you. They have a lot of assets relative to liability, and they have two massive numbers under equity.  Their share capital is massive, and rising and their deficit (accumulated) is also massive and only increasing.  The income statement solidifies that they are issuing shares - an increase of about 12% in the past year.  Their recent press releases are optimistic, and they make it seem like they have operations by showing processing plants they have, but some deeper research shows that they are destroying a lot of shareholder value every year.

Another case is los andes copper ltd (LA).  They are currently in a legal battle with a community in Chile, and I will let you be the judge of what the legal outcome could be when LA decides to do battle with the Chilean people and their government to get mining permits.  Here is the document provided by the people who live near LA’s claim: [Letter](https://miningwatch.ca/sites/default/files/cartaalpueblodecanadaeningles.pdf?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=b448350a5f76af5368f87ce063d4319cff9b66ee-1626201317-0-AXFv2valzhSwnCpQiSIhbMo2SAIhHoLiZTc9oXNkfwh3OSKKEr13VfPLh6ZsmKsF6Tl6QwAQAgaeynHOom93zUm8xdvtCLXmN21ptH7JkgCTxAXwdG9e89blu_egpn1RCaJX0jhlUt2Y_01755uHiBhj2tOGWd9gO7gKiYzz0vDprZWVbjv04PFyaeghx3e_XbP6dC2CvcKAi7rNCO5bDsSP7tSkfidqbctRedi66KdsopM1QLzo_Y8z0HOwn9uMBskZkHJSglIYtPsbLGoew6WPHAI8RxVelWupCSx_m4fimOy_5n8exl2pxoeKjfpDZrx0h4wzkkDJ1zSg1de7bxZm9CAEF3-s_ncnNM_t9HtwF1CjhvbFCTfS2jrcJdUPFkT1vbJYVQgF1td3YFJXUaJtzDWZqp4rkaB9GL60TjB9I9zScUUv47IK4sZZxRhSaVDNjr9aHewAlH3g3hBWHfk)

And take virginia energy resources, an american company that owns the property above but has consistently been denied the permit to extract the resources.  Their claim has been re-evaluated many times over and gone from tens of millions to under 3M.  Most of their costs over their 14 year existence have been legal, and in that time they have accumulated over 47 Million in accumulated deficit (Mostly from legal fees), issued $50M in equity, and only have a $3M claim.  Who in their right mind spends 16 times what a claim is worth on legal fees to get a permit to extract it?? Certainly not a rational or competent manager.  

There are hundreds of companies like this.  One can only guess at the motives behind someone who promotes one of these companies.  I have decided that when you see someone promoting these companies, they probably fall into these categories:

* Someone who has lost a lot of their investment due to massive dilution and trying to make their money back.
* Someone who is not a long term investor in a company but trying to pump them because they are small.
* Someone who has not done enough research or has been deluded into believing that the company has good prospects.
* Someone who has done very deep analysis and determined that the company may generate some revenue.

As you can see, only the last of these categories has good intentions.  And it is hard to tell the difference between someone with an objectively justified bullish case and someone who is trying to persuade you that the company they are talking about has great potential despite its state of despair.

Moral of the story, don’t let convincing stories on exploration companies deceive you without researching the properties and financial health yourself"
stocks,"Quick question about “sharing” profits with someone I bumped into an old buddy of mine and apparently he knows a really successful trader. He has an “agreement” with this guy where the trader basically tells him exactly when, where and how much to buy and sell, and they split the profit 70/30 (30 going to the trader). So it’s like the trader gets to profit off his own trades plus that extra 30% and my buddy makes 70%. 
Apparently he’s doing REALLY well for himself. He still has a job but he makes wayyy more trading with this investors advice.  I didn’t really ask much about it at the time, I just thought it was pretty cool and I had never heard of anything like that before. But now it’s got me thinking lol. why the heck didn’t I think of this before? But most importantly, is this even legal?"

I mean if investors think the market will crash, the market will crash as they will all start pulling out, crashing the stocks. Seems a bit ridiculous!

Payment for Order Flow has become one of the recent focuses as a primary manipulation tool, coupled with Dark Pool usage. FTDs to increase short positions, some claim, have grown the volume of the floats two or three times, and are being hidden in derivatives and options in a can-kicking fashion.

There have been multiple new rules recently imposed which seem to be designed to protect the DTCC from a cataclysmic event which some interpret as being inspired by said manipulation of meme stocks. 

What do you all feel about this? Are we onto something here, or do you think a mass order of tinfoil hats is in need?

I have holdings in $AMC as full disclosure, and I'm not intending discussion of the fundamentals of any particular stock or company.

Further full disclosure, all of this shit is far above my head and knowledge, so don't expect insightful educated discussion on the markets from me! Haha"

stocks,"My $23,500 Dividend Portfolio Update as of June! A little portfolio update for the month of June! Ok so my portfolio increased by another -- very solid 4.41% and ended the month at $23,480 dollars! So stoked because that makes back to back months of 4 percent gains!

Basically it was a very strong month for Nvidia as it’s upcoming 4 to 1 dividend split has investors raising price targets across the board, leading to further investment interest and in turn raising the actual price.

And at a 15% gain for the month, I only wish I had purchased a few more shares when the last tech dip occurred. If you remember me saying in one of my recent recap videos, I am still extremely bullish on nvidia in the long term, so while this short term growth is great, I still believe the price point to be a great distance away.

stocks,"Wash sale but for equivalent tickers 
Suppose I sell QQQ at a loss to incur a taxable loss. Then, I buy the equivalent QQQM at the same overall cost basis as my QQQ sale. Is this still considered a wash sale? If not, then it’s pretty much a way to get around a wash sale for specific stocks that have these equivalent tickers?

I suppose there are other tangential examples like selling SPY at a loss to buy VOO. I am inclined to believe that a SPY sell and a VOO buy is not considered a wash sale since they’re two different products from two different companies. However, if a sale of an equivalent ticker from the same company happens, would that count as a wash sale?"

stocks,"Here's why I like to watch Mad Money [serious] Across reddit people love blasting Jim Cramer and there's certainly plenty of fair criticisms to make, but watching Mad Money has been extremely beneficial for me.

It's important to have the right context, so this is how the show is broken down:

* Opening segment: Jim's thoughts on the emerging trends in the market, what happened today, things to keep an eye out for in the coming week(s). This segment is about 10-12 mins.
* Middle segments: Typically there are 2-3 CEO interviews.  If there are only 2 interviews, Jim typically does a ""special topic"" segment where he does a deep dive into a specific stock or industry.  He also does a more technical focused segment where he looks at charts about once a week or so during one of these middle segments.
* Lightning Round: Callers phone in and ask about specific stocks in rapid-fire for about 5 mins.
* Closing segment: Final 5 mins of the show where Jim shares some final thoughts...similar to the opening segment but only about half the time and with different topics.

Okay, so first off, the lightning round segment is completely unhelpful for serious investors. I almost never watch this part of the show.  For some reason people seem to imply the whole show is lightning round type of stuff...it's not.  This segment is to drive interest / entertainment, which has worked pretty well for the show, but pointless for investors to listen to.

The CEO interview segments - I only watch if it's the CEO of a company I may be interested in.  Definitely need to understand that the interview is essentially a sales pitch for the company.  I've gleaned some interesting info from these interviews, but understand I'm only getting part of the story.

For me the most helpful / interesting part of the show are the opening / closing segments and any of the special topic segments in the middle when they occur.  I watch these every day while I'm either making dinner or showering / getting ready for bed (I pull it up on my phone via youtubeTV).  It takes about 15-20 mins total.  

**SKIP TO THIS POINT IF YOU DONT WANT TO READ ANYTHING ELSE:**

The reason I like these segments is because it gives me investing *ideas* I can go and research and do my own due diligence on. While he obviously gets things wrong, more often than not I've been introduced to some really solid analysis and ideas that have led to me making tens of thousands of dollars over the last few years of watching the show / investing.  I've been pushed to look into stocks and industries that I would have otherwise never looked into. It's NOT a good idea to blindly go buy any stock he (or any other analyst) mentions.

The motivation behind this post is to offer another perspective in contrast with the folks that just blast the show / cramer as an know-nothing idiot.  A lot of investors here (particularly newer investors) can really learn a lot from the show and it can push them in the right direction as they look for stocks / industries to research.

**tl;dr** \- The show is a great place to get introduced to investing ideas and stocks that I later do my own due diligence on, especially if you only focus on the most beneficial segments.  It cuts a lot of the leg work and searching, so my efforts are focused on typically good quality stocks (though there have been multiple recommendations from the show that my own research has led me to stay away from the stock). The result is that I've made some excellent stock picks and made great money over the years as a direct result of the things I've learned from the show.  

Last thoughts: One recent example of a huge miss by Cramer is that he strongly recommended buying into the DIDI IPO.  If you've followed any financial news at all in the last week or so, you know the Chinese government cracked down on DIDI and the stock plummeted.  Cramer fully took ownership of this blunder on his show and said he's never going to recommend a Chinese IPO again.  Ironically, I actually avoided this stock because of how skeptical Cramer has been of Chinese stocks historically.  I was very surprised when he recommended DIDI (he said he thought his was one of the few Chinese stocks worth buying), but I decided to stay away because the Chinese government was way too big of an X factor for me.  Glad I went with my gut.  Gotta do your own due diligence and ultimately make your own calls, because it's your money.  The show is a great place for ideas, but you've got to do the rest of the leg work! Because clearly he's not going to be right 100% of the time."

stocks,"($SFL) - Q2 2021 Forecast ##**Abstract**

Due to precipitous increases in container and dry-bulk shipping spot-rates, it is my belief that SFL will dramatically outperform analyst consensus estimates of $0.19/share earnings in Q2 2021. My model indicates they will achieve $0.27 on a recurring basis, up over 50% when compared to the previous quarter, and a dividend increase is very likely to occur as a result. My price target for SFL is $12/share following its earnings announcement in August.

For more a more detailed analysis on what is driving this growth, check out my recent submission history for the Q1 report.

##**Summary of Estimates**

Total charter hire of $145M in Q2 vs $135M in Q1.

Recurring earnings of $30.9M (~$0.27) in Q2 vs $20.4M (~$0.18/share) in Q1.

Non-cash/non-recurring earnings of $5.0M in Q2 vs $11.1M in Q1.

Total combined earnings of $35.9M (~$0.31/share) in Q2 vs $31.5M (~$0.27/share) in Q1.

**Liners**

Q2 estimated hire of $76.3M vs $74.4M in Q1
Inclusive of $2.3M estimated Q2 profit share vs $2.4M in Q1

Increase attributable to higher rates for 2 container feeders and 2 car carriers trading in the spot market. Decreased profit share due to declining scrubber fuel spread.

**Bulkers**

Q2 estimated hire $41.6M of vs $31.9M in Q1
45% of charter hire coming from ships operating in the spot markets.

Increase attributable to 7 handysize bulkers and 3 supramax bulkers trading in the spot market, and 8 capesize bulkers on time charters with profit share.

**Tankers**

Q2 estimated hire of $15.2M vs $15.3M in Q1
Inclusive of $0.3M estimated profit share in both quarters

Decrease attributable to slightly lower rates for 2 Suezmax tankers and declining scrubber fuel spread.

**Rigs**

Q2 estimated hire of $12.2M vs $13.2M in Q1

Decrease attributable to forbearance agreement that captures only ~75% of charter hire. Agreement was signed midway through Q1 and $12.2M/quarter is expected until Seadrill concludes its restructuring. Note that $4.1M/quarter is accruing in escrow and will be released following the Seadrill restructuring.

##**NonRecurring/NonCash Items**

**Securities**

We estimate a gain of $2.6MM on marketable securities due in Q2. This is entirely driven by appreciation of 1.4M shares held in Frontline. SFL may have sold these shares during Q2, but a likelier scenario is that the forward purchasing agreement was extended, as the shares are being borrowed against.

SFL’s other bonds and securities are likely to have appreciated as they are oil-related, but are also highly illiquid and difficult to value.

**Swaps &amp; Derivatives**

It is difficult to find accurate pricing history on all of the swaps and forward exchange contracts that SFL holds. With that said, I estimate an approximate $2-3MM appreciation on swaps and derivative contracts. Note that any gains on swaps or forwards are non-cash and will be offset by increased debt payments over the duration of the contract. Valuation of forwards is expected to increase based on announcement of aggressive rate hikes by Norges bank beginning in September, offset partially by a more aggressive timetable for rate hikes by the US Federal Reserve and appreciation of the dollar relative to the Norwegian Kroner.

**Other items**

Gain on repurchase of debt and a small reduction in the credit-loss provision is likely, but not estimated.

##**Disclosure**

I hold long positions in derivatives related to SFL. I am not an investment advisor or finance professional, nor have I held experience in a related position."

stocks,"Lockheed Martin (LMT) Due Diligence: Long story short, LMT is a $600 stock that is wrongly trading at $380. The simple investment thesis is ""you can only fire a bullet once.""

Lockheed Martin is aerospace and defense company which provides high-end military equipment. Aircraft is where they particularly shine with the F-35 accounting for about 30% of the company's revenue.

The lion's share of the company's revenue comes the united states government. Most of all aircraft used by the USAF comes from this one company.

**CEO INFORMATION**

Lockheed recently announced 2020 a new CEO in 2020 to run the company. His name is Jim Taiclet. While having several years of experience with Lockheed, his previous experience as CEO was not with another defense company.

Most of his career was spent running the successful REIT known as American Tower (AMT). The company has been very successful both during and after his tenure. (Which is another great dividend growth company which shows his experience returning capital and his dedication to increasing shareholder value).

Quarterly Payout:

2020 - $2.60

2019 - $2.40

2018 - $2.20

2017 - $2.00

2016 - $1.82

2015 - $1.65

Dividend Yield = 2.68%

Payout Ratio = \~40% (Very Safe)

Let me start be saying that this company is EXTREMELY profitable. The company is currently on an 18 year consecutive dividend streak. Not to mention the company buys back BILLIONS of its own stock year in and year out, with the share count having decreased by 50% since 2009. I fully expect this company to be a dividend aristocrat in a few years.

The dividend yield is about double that of the S&amp;P as of today and only has a Payout Ratio of about 40%. This means that not only does this company have a good yield while buying back stock, but this company can EASILY afford to maintain and RAISE the dividend over time dramatically.

**MERGERS &amp; ACQUISITIONS**

The company has a long history of M&amp;A activity and the most recent example of this Aerojet Rocketdyne (AJRD). This is yet another example of the company using its financial fortress of a balance sheet and exemplary cash flows to acquire other businesses.

AJRD is a space and aeronautics company which could potentially extend more deals with NASA and the U.S. government. This was recently announced about six months ago in December 2020 and is likely to finalize in 2021.

**FINANCIAL INFORMATION**

The company has incredible financials. The balance sheet is a financial fortress. The debt load is very controllable. Cash flows continue to pour in record numbers year after year and 2021 guidance issued by the company expects record revenue and record EPS for the year.

The Biden administration just issued an increase in defense spending of about \~1% earlier this year. All the more reason for this company's financials to continue to stay healthy. Financials linked below....

**GROWTH STORY MOVING FORWARD**

LMT is expected to grow top-line revenue numbers 4.50% in 2021 and 3.70% in 2022. Earnings per share for the company in 2020 finished at $24.58. This is expected to grow to $26.68 in 2021 and $27.90 in 2022.

Contracts are usually signed many years in advance. Revenues can be easily forecasted for the next several years due to the timelines of the contracts. Furthermore, innovation is not only encouraged, but expected by shareholders AND the united states military is order for our nation to maintain relevant in terms of weaponry.

New age military equipment is usually pretty ""hush-hush"" on what is in the works but Lockheed Martin does disclose some of these new products including technologies such as new highly intelligent drones, missile systems, and even targeted lasers.

One thing is for sure, the military will continue come out with bigger and more powerful weapons as time goes on. Who will likely be selling it to them? Probably good ole LMT.

Newer acquisitions such as the recent AJRD deal allows Lockheed to also focus on other products in the space category and is another wildcard with some potential.

[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/LMT/analysis?p=LMT](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/LMT/analysis?p=LMT)

**COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE/ BARRIER TO ENTRY**

The regulations are incredibly strict. The demand for capital is VERY HIGH with projects frequently running into the billions of dollars. Switching from one business to another poses risks for the government and our military and are usually avoided.

This makes the U.S. government very loyal and sticky to LMT business and this is very likely to continue. While there are competitors in the space....Lockheed continues to dominate this market.

**VALUATION (WHY IT'S A GREAT BUY IMO)**

As mentioned earlier, the company is expected to produce $27.90 in EPS in 2022. Based of of today's price of $390, this gives this company a forward PE ratio of \~13.9. This is an *EXTREMELY low forward PE* ratio for a company putting up record numbers and dominating the market that it operates in.

This is even more impressive considering it's still off a fair amount from it's previous all time highs. I am very bullish and this is one of my largest positions. I am not remotely interested in selling. I am buying at these prices or really anything even close to these levels. I wouldn't sell a share if this company were to go to $800 a share tomorrow morning.

[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/LMT/analysis?p=LMT](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/LMT/analysis?p=LMT)

**RISK FACTORS TO CONSIDER**

Almost all revenue comes from one customer (the government). It is steady and consistent but if the government were to fall out of love with Lockheed then this company would be negatively impacted.

There aren't many who could take down LMTs throne but their main competitor is Boeing. Boeing has the capital and leverage to compete with Lockheed Martin long term.

This company is susceptible to a number of different geopolitical risks. Conflicts with other countries could be both a Negative AND a positive for Lockheed.

The current political climate is leaning harder and harder towards a more relaxed defense budget."

2) People say penny stocks are risky. But if I put $500 in a penny stock, let’s say a $1 stock, and put a stop order on it at $2, isn’t that a lot more likely to happen within 10 years than $900 on a stock like SPY?

3) Is there a chance that a stop order won’t fully sell? What if a stock nosedives rapidly? How are there still buyers for that $2?"
stocks,"JP Morgan earnings soar amid 'exceptionally strong' consume balance sheets, credit releases. A good signal for the bank stocks? JPMorgan Chase (JPM) kicked off the second quarter earnings season for bulge-bracket backs on Tuesday, reporting better-than-expected earnings results that were bolstered by a strong economy and the release of credit reserves. 

Here are the key figures versus estimates, according to Bloomberg:

Adjusted earnings per share (EPS): $3.78 vs. $3.13 estimate

Excluding credit reserve releases: $3.03 per share

Revenue: $31.4 billion vs. $30.07 billion estimate

CEO Jamie Dimon said the development reflected the underlying strength of the economy, and the health of consumers.

He noted that the consumer balance sheet ""remains exceptionally strong,"" while the economic outlook ""continues to improve."" The CEO pointed out that net charge-offs were down 53%, which ""were better than expected, reflecting the increasingly healthy condition of our customers and clients.” Dimon added that debit and credit card spending was up 45% from a year ago, and up 22% from the second quarter of 2019 pre-pandemic levels. 

Breaking the results down further, total markets revenue declined 30% to $6.8 billion in the quarter, with fixed income revenue falling 44%, but were offset by equity markets revenue climbing 13%. In recent weeks, Dimon suggested a ""more normal"" quarter for trading with revenue from trading fixed income and equities ""a little bit north of $6 billion."""

stocks,"CTS.TO a hidden gem: a very undervalued growth/value stock 
About: CTS is currently a Canadian based I.T solutions company. They serve the mid market customers compared to Constellation and CGI who serve the larger enterprise customers.



Why it’s undervalued: Compared to its main competitor CGI which trades to a p/s of 2.31, CTS trades at a p/s of 1.89. Here’s the catch, CTS is projected to increase revenues this year to 2B. Meanwhile the market cap is only 1.9B. They also continue to double EBDITA ever since inception. By 2025 the CEO lays out that they will be making 5B in revenues and over 500M in EBDITA. If we use CGIs current valuation for p/s that would value Converge at 11.5B in 2025 and would imply a price of $60 a share. The market is simply not valuing the insane growth that CTS is providing. Doubling profits while trading at a forward PE of 20 is completely irrational, where else can you get value and Zoom like growth in one stock?




Why should we believe the CEO?: Well he has a lot of experience in this sector before he founded CTS and has not only met previous expectations but surpassed them. This year alone they acquired over 7 new companies and 22 ever since IPO. He laid out a plan over 2 years ago and has executed ever since as were in phase 3 of growth now, the Euro expansion.


Future catalysts: Laid out by management they have shown extreme interests in expanding in Europe. They have signed NDAs with 6 companies that they are interested in acquiring and have recently hired 2 new management that specialize in the Europe IT space. This is happening in Q3! Also a potential dual listing in the US could definitely boost the eyes and capital on this stock!


Risks: Obviously with any investments there’s some risks. With CTS they diluted a lot this year. With a 175M offering at $7.50 in June and another offering in January for 86.5M at $4.85. Take in note that we may get diluted more in the future. Another is reliance on management. If we lose the CEO or one of the main executives that can really hurt the momentum of the company. Margins are also slim in this business 5-10% but is offsetting by the massive amounts of revenue.


Tldr: CTS is heavily undervalued. It’s easily the most attractive Canadian stock that should attract both value and growth investors.

stocks,"Costco to 425 in 2 weeks I believe today was a slight pullback as some people were taking profits, but I fully believe Costco stock to hit somewhere around 420-425 in the next two weeks of trading. They have had great returns these last few months and quarters, and they are only getting better. The pandemic shifted a lot of people to buying more groceries, and lots of those things will probably stick with families that weren’t used to cooking or buying in bulk. Also, pandemic or no pandemic, Costco will be heavily utilized by the upper and middle class. Memberships being a big reason for their rev, and they are able to move lots of product. Basically they don’t really make a lot of money from selling products. Either way, I see their trajectory as going higher towards the beginning of earnings releases. It was at 415 today and went down. Which means, it would have only needed 1-2% to hit the 420-425 level. At this price, it’ll be 3-4% in the next two weeks if it went upwards. Now it doesn’t need to happen in one day, even though I think it should. Thoughts on Costco for a short term play? I already know long term it’s a good hold."

stocks,"Please don’t support Doordash $DASH I’m not telling you what to do with your money financially but as a publicly traded company I feel it’s necessary to expose Doordash for its manipulative practices it uses on drivers.

1. Doordash hides tips from drivers. The independent contractor driver has no idea how much money they are going to make from an order. The driver is forced to gamble in order to try and make any money using the service. For example if a customer tipped $20 Doordash will only show the driver $7 of the order until the order is completed. If the customer tipped nothing the driver won’t know if they are gambling on the order. 

Recently a group found a workaround to make orders transparent. To show the full amount of the orders. They shared this knowledge with all the drivers. Doordash never publicly acknowledged this but they never banned a driver for using it either. Instead Doordash quietly patched the ability to see the full order amount. Doordash can’t even develop a stable driver app but they are obsessed with manipulating drivers so much they prioritized this and patched it. 

2. Doordash uses in app psychological manipulation in order to get a driver to take unprofitable orders. New drivers have no idea they can decline orders without repercussion but the app forced you to basically decline the same order 4 times while you are driving in order to get to the next order. 

3. Doordash offers peak pay which is bonus pay to drivers to incentivize them to work during busy hours. The peak pay will say $5 extra pay per order from 5pm-9pm. The driver thinks they will make $5 extra per order however the app reduces and even removes the peak pay before it’s scheduled end time. Doordash does this simply to saturate the market. Once the market is saturated it takes the money away from the driver and hopes they will continue driving to take bad orders.

The business model is oppressive for the driver. Some drivers have to decline hundreds of orders daily just to make $50.

4. Prices going up with inflation? Guess what Doordash did? They reduced driver base pay from $3 per order to $2.50!

Please don’t support this company. I hope the mods are okay with this."

stocks,"Schwab Intelligent Portfolio performance vs S&amp;P 500 and Russell 2000 Data Back in November 2019 I decided to see what Schwab's Intelligent Portfolio was all about and was curious how it would compare to simply investing in an S&amp;P 500 ETF.

[Performance Chart (Intelligent Portfolio vs S&amp;P 500 vs Russell 2000](https://imgur.com/W4Q07Hm)

As you can see in the chart above, the intelligent portfolio has under performed both the S&amp;P 500 as well as the Russell 2000.

I have my portfolio set to as highly risky as possible which breaks down to the following:

* 81% - Stocks
* 9.7% - Fixed Income
* 2% - Commodities
* 7.3% - Cash

I wish there was a way to tell the portfolio not to keep such a large percent cash, but I get that there needs to be a reserve in case of a market dip so it can buy more shares of various ETFs.

I'm not trying to sway anyone one way or another about intelligent/robo portfolios, but figured the data might be interesting for anyone who is curious about their performance.

The difference in performance was a lot closer pre-pandemic but separated much more significantly during the covid recovery.

I'll probably continue to deposit my $100/mo into the portfolio and monitor the trends, but if I was simply looking to maximize my set and forget funds, I'd probably just go with VOO or SWPPX (which I also contribute to)."

Earnings And Analyst Coverage: AvePoint reported first-quarter financial results on May 20. The company announced total revenue of $38.8 million, up 19% year-over-year and SaaS revenue of $18.3 million, up 78% year-over-year.

AvePoint also raised its fiscal year guidance and announced that the company remains debt-free. 

AvePoint anticipates announcing its next quarterly financial results in early August. The company is expecting analyst coverage from numerous firms to be published within the next week, Jiang told Benzinga

For those of you who are unaware, $NLST has been going at it with google for over 10 years now. They have filed multiple lawsuits against google for theft of their 912 seminal patent. 

A seminal patent differs from a regular patent because the technology is deemed to be ""AN INVENTION SO IMPACTFUL THAT IT CRESTES OR SHIFTS THE TECHNOLOGY SPACE"". Netlists' technology essentially allows computers to access 4× more ram then it normaly would - the reason why google searches are so fast and has continued to stay a top the industry. 

Think of it like this ""Google - Powered by netlist."" 

So after years of appealing google has finally decided not to appeal, essentially agreeing to a settlement. Netlist CEO has already previously stated that he is seeking billions from google, so in essence, if google is agreeing to settle, then google is willing to pay billions. Intel had to payout over 2 billion earlier this year for a non seminal patent, so picture what netlist might get.

NLST currently has a market cap of 1.5B, so imagine what a settlement in the BILLIONS would do for it. 

It also recently was awarded $40 million from sk hynix, one of the biggest producers of semiconductors behind samsung as well as a supply sales agreement and will recieve royalties. 

They are also currently suing samsung for breach of contract.

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Monday, July 12, 2021 **PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, July 12, 2021**

After a spurt in volatility last Thursday, stocks have shaken off any jitteriness, with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ) once again powering to fresh intraday records today. Looking ahead, market participants are waiting for Q2 earnings season to begin tomorrow, with two of the largest banks in the US, JP Morgan (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS), reporting results and Jerome Powell’s testimony before Congress later this week.

With Q2 earnings are fast approaching, market participants are gearing up for what is expected to be a repeat of Q1 record-setting season, with earnings expected to continue being super-charged by stronger than expected demand from savings-loaden consumers and the continued reopening of the US economy thanks to effective distribution of the coronavirus vaccine. So far, analysts are looking for S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 61.9% year-on-year in aggregate, according to FactSet data – an estimate UBS's Head of Equity Derivatives Research Stuart Kaiser said may still be ""need to be revised higher."" This would represent a sharp acceleration from the 50% year-on-year growth recorded during Q1’s earnings season.

A big part of the strong Q2 earnings growth is easy comparisons to the year-earlier period that represented the bottom of the Covid-19 earnings impact. But Q2 estimates also reflect genuine growth, with total index earnings expected to be up +8.8% compared to the pre-Covid 2019 Q2 period. In other words, even when compared to an earnings season 2 years ago, well before the coronavirus pandemic, this earnings season is expected to show very strong growth. Estimates for Q2 and beyond have been steadily going up, with the current +60.5% earnings growth rate up from +50.6% at the end of March and +41.6% at the start of January 2021.

Goldman Sachs strategist David Kosting said that market pariticpants should focus on three questions heading into this earnings season: (1) How will companies deal with rising material costs and supply chain disruptions? (2) How are companies planning to prioritize cash spending? (3) How will companies deal with policy uncertainties, especially surrounding a potential tax hike?

In addition to earnings season, market participants are also looking forward to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell giving his semi-annual Monetary Policy Report to Congress Wednesday and Thursday of this week. Analysts are expecting Powell to once again strike a dovish tone (meaning unlikely to take aggressive action against inflation and instead favor employment), given the mixed June Job Report, which saw a better than expected number of jobs added to the economy but the unemployment rate tick higher and last week’s meeting minutes which showed an increasing divide between members regarding the timeline to begin tapering quantitative easing. In my view, Powell is trying to do three things in the upcoming meeting: (1) reiterate his view that the recovery of the economy is not yet complete, (2) inflation is a result of pandemic-era disruptions, and (3) prevent a repeat of the 2013 Taper Tantrum, an unwarranted, silly, collective market-panic that triggered a spike in U.S. Treasury yields after investors learned that the Federal Reserve was slowly putting the brakes on its quantitative easing program passed during the height of the 2008-09 recession. Moving ahead, further economic reports on consumer price inflation and retail sales out this week are expected to once again underscore that the pace of economic recovery in the US remains limited by supply chain disruptions and labor market imbalances.

Kathy Jones, chief fixed income strategist at Charles Schwab said, “I think the recovery is on track, it’s really just the rate of change that has slowed. We couldn’t continue to grow at 9-10% GDP growth every quarter, so obviously it’s going to slow down. I think one of the things that got into markets that got \[Treasury\] yields tumbling was maybe the fact that the Fed was going to hike rates sooner than anticipated. That sends a signal to the long end of the bond market that maybe the Fed isn;t going to tolerate higher inflation for longer and that they’re going to step on the brakes sooner rather than later ... we don't think that's going to be the case though. We think the economy is doing well, yields will probably bounce back."" I agree with this sentiment. 

**Highlights**

* Over the weekend, Richard Branson became the first civilian to go to space with his own company Virgin Galactic (SPCE), a remarkable milestone as companies like Bezos’ Blue Origin and Musk’s SpaceX intensify competition in space tourism.
* Despite successfully completing the trip, shares of Virgin Galactic (SPCE) fell more than 10% after the company announced it planned to take advantage of the elevated stock price by selling $500 million in stock.
* Tesla (TSLA) Chief Executive Elon Musk on Monday defended the electric-vehicle maker's purchase of SolarCity Corp. in court, telling a Delaware judge that he didn't act improperly during the negotiating process. This comes in response to a lawsuit filed by TSLA shareholders that allege Musk forced the company to buy SolarCity, a solar-cell manufacturer, in order to save his investment in the company. Frankly, this lawsuit seems a little ridiculous to me given SolarCity has proven a smart acquisition.
* Walt Disney (DIS) said on Sunday that “Black Widow”, the newest Marvel movie, made $80 million in theater sales, the largest domestic opening weekend since “Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker” in 2019, a strong sign that appetite to go to the movies remains high among Americans. Comparatively, “Black Widow” made $60 million through streaming purchases.
* In yet another crackdown of big-tech companies, Chinese regulators are reportedly set to order Tencent (TCEHY) to give up their exclusive rights to music labels and pay a small fine.
* Broadcom (AVGO) is reportedly in talks to by SAS Institute, a software company with upwards of $3 billion a year in revenue in a deal valued between $15-$20 billion. This is yet another acquisition by one of the world’s largest semiconductor companies.
* Microsoft (MSFT) announced it was acquiring cybersecurity firm RiskIQ to help reduce risk amid “the increasing sophistication and frequency of cyberattacks”.

stocks,"2x Leveraged SPY as a long term investment Came across this

[http://www.ddnum.com/articles/leveragedETFs.php](http://www.ddnum.com/articles/leveragedETFs.php)

Was thinking about investing in a 2x Leveraged SPY for 5+ years. Will add positions biweekly for the foreseeable future. I'm not from the US so I can't buy the ETF. I can however buy a 2x certificate with no fees with a 0.09% spread.

What is the current consensus here regarding leveraged ETFs as a long time play?

When looking at SSO SPY500 since its inception 2006, I can also see that it has outperformed SPY considerably. 

It went from 17.68 to 124.32

while SPY 127 to 437

As a primarily Canadian company I think they have a serious advantage as a technology-healthcare hybrid company as well. Healthcare in Canada, despite being free and available to all, is slow to adapt and is often reliant upon old systems. I can attest to this with the number of Windows XP rigs I see at the hospital when I have to go in (I'm Canadian) and the vast amount of healthcare data sitting relatively unused when it could be examined and leveraged to improve treatment outcomes across the board. Healthcare got turned upside down by COVID and WELL is one of the few companies capable of really stepping in and making it better than it was before, instead of relying on outdated technology and practices. 

As always, your call, but I think this is a winner getting ready to really explode.

Their Crater Lake Scandium &amp; Rare Earth Elements property is a gem!! Just check the recent developments and what they already announced is coming in 2021. Easy to see that SP will only rise. Might explode - I think there is a very good change that this might be the case;

1. March 18, 2021 $IPG is awarded a $90,000 Federal Grant for Scandium Material Research with McMaster University. When the Federal Government gets involved you know that good things are coming. Cooperation with McMaster is a very welcome development.
2. Then on May 18, 2021 it was announced that $IPG and Eck Industries Executed a Letter of Intent for Collaborative Scandium Material Research &amp; Development. 
3. June 9, 2021 - Imperial Mining Develops High-Recovery Extraction Process for Scandium and Rare Earth Elements for Crater Lake Mineralization.
4. Then June 23, 2021 Imperial Mining Receives Final Crater Lake Drill Results: Data Sent to Engineers for 43-101 Resource Estimation on TG Zone.

Now we are waiting for the big news on 43-101 Resource Estimate. This alone could send SP soaring. It should be done by the end of July. With the resource estimation in hand, likely in July, and completion of the metallurgical flowsheet, $IPG will commence work on delivering a Preliminary Economic Assessment (PEA) for the project some time this fall, as originally scheduled.

When the PEA comes in $IPG should be anywhere between 50 cents to $1.00. This is a golden opportunity!! I've been increasing my position accordingly. I think there is time to do that until the 43-101 comes in and then we will see high SP. On the other hand this is a virtually zero risk bet. No way this will slide. Only upside here. Only question is how high will this go and within what period of time."

stocks,"$CARV is a unicorn about to explode [DD] Very rarely do opportunities come along that bring me to drop more than 5% of my portfolio into them, but I've put about half of my portfolio into $CARV. Shorts have absolutley overextended themselves and are about to get obliterated here. But before I go into that, first, a bit about $CARV.

# What does $CARV do, and how are they financially?

$CARV is a bank that has been around for a while that provides all the typical banking services, but it focuses on Black/African American communities that have had limited access to banking services in the past. They've been around since 1948 and thus have helped a lot of people who were blatantly discriminated against by other banks. In other words, this is a very ethical company that has helped people at a major disadvantage. 

$CARV is at no risk of bankruptcy; they have a book value per share of $7.96, meaning that their share price is only trading at about 2.5x their net asset value (assets minus debts). Although they were once in a lot better shape (before the great financial crisis), they have been turning things around substantially with endorsements or collaborations from major banks such as Bank of America or Wells Fargo (e.g., Carver bank customers can now use Wells Fargo's ATMs free of charge, which is helping to expand their clientele). They have been seeing substantial growth lately; their total revenue last quarter was up 30.74% YoY and their net income was up 46.33%--though it should be noted that this growth is mostly due to the COVID-induced slowdown. Nonetheless, $CARV isn't about to go bankrupt by any means, so you don't need to worry about that with this stock.

# Why is $CARV the play? Shorts overextended themselves and are already fucked.

$CARV had a \~100% run up at the beginning of June. $CARV has an extremely small float (only 957k shares) so it moves a lot on very little volume. Shorts shorted $CARV down hard and kept their positions open. Recently, some famous dude on Twitter (I honestly can't remember who he is) tweeted about $CARV's high short interest, and the price exploded. According to a site I use (not sure if I can mention names here), $CARV currently has 70% short interest. On a float of less than a million shares. Shares on loan are 956k (including new loans today), with a float of 957k. Shorts are completely overextended on this stock. More importantly, the average age of the loans is 9 days, meaning that shorts opened their positions on average \~$12. ***Nearly all those shorts are completely underwater.*** 

When someone gets margin called, they're usually given 2-5 business days to cover. Big clients use big brokers and usually get five days. So we should expect that about five trading days after the jump Friday, which put every short underwater, they should cover. 

Moreover, ***CARV does not have options for shorts to create an unsqueezable position with***. For most stocks, if someone shorts, they can buy a call to make an unsqueezeable position. But CARV doesn't have options, so CARV shorts will have to cover no matter the asking price.

In other words, ***there is no need to squeeze anyone, these people are already fucked as long as the price stays at its current level.*** 

For proof of this, let's compare $CARV to $GME on GME's ascent.

# GME shows what will happen to CARV.

Everyone knows about GME; it was absurdly shorted and had an enormous squeeze. But how many of you were in GME early January, when it looked like it squeezed on 1/13? I was, which is why I noticed this parallel. I considered selling because I thought it was done. But it was just getting started, as is CARV.

On first glance, $CARV's daily chart looks fairly bearish, but it parallels the start of both of $GME's ascents. Given the enormous short interest and the fact that almost all shorts are currently underwater, I am expected margin calls soon. Take a look at the charts. 

First, look at CARV over the last three days. Note the \~100% increase on the first day, a much higher point on the second day (that still maintained a \~15% gain on the second day), and a drop on the third day. Note the volume trended down, though it's still early 7/12. 

Now look at GME back in early January; look in particular at its initial ascent on 1/13 through 1/15. The price action on GME from 1/13 to 1/15 is almost identical to CARV, though 1/14 did close higher than it opened and CARV didn't. 1/15 still had a big red day, closing down over 10%. But the shorts couldn't drop it further, and they were all underwater from positions opened early January through 1/13. Five trading days after 1/14, margin calls started, and the rest of January is history.

GME also had another launch at the end of February after coming down from its initial launch--similar to CARV. Take a look at GME 2/24-2/26. Again, the same pattern: A **huge** increase one day, followed by a modest gain next day, and third day that ended down and hit the short sale restriction as it did. But the price never dropped further, and GME took off again as margin calls began to hit.

# TLDR

$CARV is an ethical company and a unicorn of shorts overextending themselves. They're already squeezed as long as the price doesn't drop. Hop in and enjoy the margin calls.

Positions: 1010 shares at $33.89, and not worried at all."

stocks,"DD on NIO, P.S I don’t believe China wants them to fail. China wants to win this race. Here are a few reasons why I think NIO stands out from the crowd of upstart Chinese electric vehicle makers.

Demand is great. NIO delivered almost 22,000 vehicles in the second quarter, more than double its year-ago total. The company has gone to great lengths to build and maintain relationships with its growing army of loyal fans, who have returned the favor by placing lots of orders for its stylish electric vehicles. 

The balance sheet is strong. NIO was in real trouble in early 2020, when the pandemic hit just after a year in which it had made big investments to support its growth. But last summer's stock-price surge gave the company a chance to raise extra cash, and it didn't waste the opportunity. As of March 31, NIO had about $7.3 billion in cash on its books -- an ample reserve to weather the next big storm, if and when it arrives. 

NIO is still investing in growth. The company will add two sedan models to its currently all-SUV lineup next year, filling out its coverage of the premium auto market. And in May, it signed a new deal with its manufacturing partner that will boost its factory's output to 20,000 vehicles per month (from about 8,000 to 10,000 now) -- so it will have the capacity to deliver as its order book continues to expand."

stocks,"Beachbody ($BODY) DD  So, I did a DD on $PTON a few months ago, which brought me to this competitor company. I would’ve included it on my list of competitors in that post, but it hadn’t merged at the time.

I see this company as a potential 2-3x bagger either in the short-term or within 1-2 years, and here’s why.

**Overview:**

Beachbody ($BODY) is a fitness company that’s been operating for 20+ years (founded in 1998). They’ve just recently completed a three-way merger with FRX and Myx Fitness.

Beachbody has brought their digital content, fitness instructors and subscribers, as well as nutritional products to the table. Myx Fitness has brought their fitness equipment.

Under the name Beachbody, they plan to be a direct competitor of Peloton, but aiming at the “everyman” market as opposed to the health nut/upper-income market like Peloton. For that reason, their subscriptions and equipment are cheaper. 

\--------------------------------------------------------

**Here’s what makes it look good:**

* 400 million in cash on hand
* Zero debt 
* 3.2 million subscribers 
* 95.8% month over month digital retention 
* 1 billion in combined revenue estimated for 2021
* Has some big names on board – Arnold Schwarzenegger, LeBron James, Shaq
* Has experienced CEOS directing things, especially in the area of digital content service – Kevin Mayer (ex-CEO of TikTok, and ex-VP of Disney+), Carl Daikeler (CEO and founder of Beachbody), Jon Longdon (CEO of OpenFit and co-founder of Beachbody)
* Carl Daikeler claims he doesn’t plan to sell a single share

\------------------------------------------------------------

You can read more about the merger and the company’s info in [this article](https://www.marketwatch.com/press-release/forest-road-acquisition-corp-and-the-beachbody-company-announce-combined-first-quarter-2021-financial-results-for-beachbody-and-myx-2021-05-19-91591019?siteid=bigcharts&amp;dist=bigcharts&amp;tesla=y). 

So, basically, we’ve got a company with experience, seemingly good financials, a massive subscriber pool (many of whom are fanatical like PTON subscribers), and excellent retention rate.

You can read about the details of expected earnings, their plans and products through the [investor presentation](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5f75fdc89cf35e7524ec4b54/t/6023f07523d4531acaea9e8b/1612968070409/Beachbody+PIPE+Presentation.pdf).

&amp;#x200B;

**So, with all this promise, why is the price of the stock so low?**

Well, for one thing, it has just merged, and a drop after de-spacing while people lock in profits is common. Also, Beachbody hasn’t had much PR, so there hasn’t been a lot to push this stock up. It’s relatively undiscovered by the wider market and volume is low. 

Market makers have been using this to their advantage, and are having a great time pushing around retail. They’ve been shorting it heavily, taking it as low as it can go to make maximum profit.

For this reason, buying shares rather than options is the better choice. Last month, the MMs took the stock price down to precisely $9.99 at the very end of the day of expiry of $10 calls, so that they’d all expire worthless. The manipulation was blatant.

&amp;#x200B;

**So, if MMs are controlling this stock, why am I bullish?**

Because all it takes is a bit of PR and volume, and this stock could take off. The MMs are controlling this right now because they can, but it’s impossible for that to last forever once there’s PR, earnings and the wider market recognises its value. They’ve shorted it HEAVILY, and last I read it was at approx. 27% short interest percentage, and only 40,000 shares (https://fintel.io/ss/us/BODy) available to short.

It's also been the only other NYSE stock on the SSR list along with $AMC.

Catalysts are already starting which is recently pushing up the share price. The first 2 analysts have brought out their PTs – one at **$12** and another at **$16**, so analysts thus far are decidedly bullish on $BODY.

Beachbody’s CEO Carl states they plan to spend a lot of their cash on marketing, so we can expect to hear more and more about Beachbody in the coming months.

Now, I can’t say how much the MMs are allowing this price rise right now, but the fact of the matter is, in this current market and with all the catalysts expected to come, it’s highly unlikely they could maintain this low share price permanently. At some point they have to cover or reverse position. 

**Short Squeeze**

Some people are talking about a short squeeze with regards to this stock, which, yes, it’s a potential short squeeze candidate, but if there’s one thing $GME and $AMC has shown us, it’s that you need a LOT of buying pressure to even have a chance of that. It’s pretty rare to have a short squeeze happen, and I’m not hanging my hopes on that. The thing is, in my opinion, we don’t NEED a short squeeze here. The MMs must know that this isn’t a sustainable position for a growing company, but since we’re still early in the game, they can eke as much money as possible out of retail before more big boys and more retail buyers load in.

A lot of people, including myself, aren’t selling because it’s obvious this stock is worth more than its current price. It’s only a matter of time.

**Bearish Points:**

1) *There are many who say this company will fail because it’s got some MLM practices.* 

That would worry me if they hadn’t been in operation for 20+ years, and, as shitty as I sound, I’m not bothered since other MLM-type companies like Herbalife do just fine. I just want to make money on the stock. The fact that it’s got ex-Disney+ and ex-TikTok CEO on board makes me even more confident.

2) *Things are still speculative. We haven’t seen their earnings yet.* 

Yep, fair enough. There is still some risk in that regard. There’s also the likelihood this merger and future expenses like R&amp;D and marketing will cut into their profits, possibly making it negative for a year or two like Peloton was. However, this current market is very bullish and forward-looking, so I could see the stock price going up or maintaining anyhow, especially since it’s already so low. 

3) *This is a pandemic stock. After the pandemic is over, it’ll crash along with Peloton.*

It certainly looks like we're in a bubble right now, and many are holding their breath for when that bubble might burst, or at least have a bunch of corrections. I can see it happening with Peloton at some point (it’s already had a correction though it’s climbing back up), but this stock price is already so low, it can’t really fall much further, so in that way it’s very low-risk compared to a lot of other investments. Great upside, small downside. Also, the pandemic has changed things permanently, and while I agree it has given stocks like PTON a big boost, I’m of the belief that this technology is going to be the future, so I’d expect both PTON and BODY to recover eventually, even if they happen to be brought down by corrections.

**Disclosure:** I currently have 1,100 shares at $10.34. My PT is between $15-18 in the short-term providing the overall market stays bullish, and $25-35 within 1-2 years. As always, do your own DD, don’t take my word for it, etc., etc."

stocks,"Morning Update for Monday, 07/12/21 Good morning everyone, I hope you enjoyed the weekend.

*This list is geared towards day trading. With the momentum watchlist especially, I am typically in and out very quickly, only occasionally longer than a couple minutes, usually faster scalps.* Always have a plan when you enter a trade (for profit taking and for taking a loss), and use proper risk management for your account.

**Main Watchlist:**

Gapping UP:

* CLDX: Opening at new ATH. I'll be watching for further momentum, but also for weakness for potential shorting opportunities. 46 level could serve as resistance/support, will see what it looks like closer to market open. 
* SPCE: Coming down from highs in premarket, I'll be watching for potential shorting opportunities. Potential resistance level at 52 now. 
* UPST: Could test pretty significant resistance level at 125. If it can get up and hold above 125 I'll be bullish, as it would have crossed over relevant SMA's. 
* TAL: Premarket resistance at 22. Could see another leg up if it can get back and hold above the 22 level. 
* SONY: Gapping up over SMA(100) at the moment. I'll be watching to see if it holds up over 103.
* NIO: Potential resistance level at 46. Daily chart doesn't look great, could retrace back to the 43 level if it shows weakness this morning. 

Gapping DOWN:

* UAL: Resistance levels at 51 and 52, with possible support at 50. 
* AMC: Premarket resistance at 45. Could see more downwards movement if it breaks down below 44 and cannot recover. 
* APA: Potential support levels at 20 and 19.50. Could see upwards movement if it can get back above 20.35.
* INFY: Potential support at 20.75, potential resistance at 21.25. 

**Market Outlook:**

Stocks are looking at a mixed open after last week ended on a strong note. Worth noting that stocks have recovered off their premarket lows, for the most part. SPY is trading right around 435, and hovering near ATH levels. DIA is trading a bit over 347, and is a bit further off from ATH levels. Tech stocks are showing considerable strength, with QQQ trading just under 363. Gold and silver are slightly down this morning, while crude oil is also pulling back a bit. Marijuana stocks are down a bit in premarket trading, but nothing significant. Worth keeping an eye on for upcoming catalysts. Meme stocks are somewhat mixed, with AMC showing weakness.

Remember to use proper risk management, by making sure you size appropriately for your account and have a plan for every trade you enter (both for taking profits and cutting losses). Happy trading everyone :)"
stocks,"Western Digital $WDC stock overview and the analysts' forecasted price (disks and data storage) Western Digital is an American computer hard disk drive manufacturer and data storage company. It designs, manufactures, and sells data technology products, including storage devices such as hard disk drives (HDDs) and solid state drives (SSDs) for computing devices like desktop and notebook personal computers (PCs). The company is present in almost every field of data storage: mobile phones, tablets, PCs, portable and wearable devices, as well as automotive, Internet of Things, industrial, etc. They also offer data center systems, and cloud storage services. The company sells its products under the G-Technology, SanDisk, and WD brands to original equipment manufacturers, distributors, resellers, and retailers. Their current market cap is $21.68 billion.

Western Digital may see a further increase in revenue due to the fact that disk-drive demand continues to be warped by the rapid adoption of Chia, a cryptocurrency that relies on large capacity drives to “farm” new coins. This applies only if the Chia trend continues and the demand for storage devices is sustained. Western Digital also pays out dividends with a yield of 2.87%. Their dividend payout has decreased by 25% over the last 3 years.

Western Digital has a very good history of beating expectations when reporting earnings. They did not disappoint in the first quarter of 2021 either, beating analysts' earnings estimates by a fair amount. Their earnings per share for Q1 2021 was $1.04, beating expectations by $0.34. The company also managed to beat revenue estimates, reporting $4.14 billion versus analyst's estimates of $3.97 billion. Client Devices revenue increased 10% on the year to $2 billion, Data Center Devices and Solutions revenue declined 19% to $1.2 billion, and Client Solutions revenue increased 8% to $886 million. Their operating cash flow totaled $116 million for the quarter. Their next earnings report is scheduled for **Jul 29, 2021**.

Analysts from **Bank of America** estimate Western Digital's stock to reach $90 in the next 12 months, while the analysts at **Deutsche Bank** have given this stock a buy rating with a price target of $88. Out of 26 analysts, 20 have given Western Digital a BUY rating and 6 a HOLD rating."

However, when I look at companies like Google, P/B ratios are over 5 for the most part. Provided that ""goodwill"" works as intended, it seems to suggest that the purchase price of these companies are less than 1/5 of the total value of the outstanding shares, which doesn't make sense to me."

**Trality**

Trality I think is known for having an educational platform which can be great for beginners. There's a drag and drop interface for new users and a Python editor for those who know how to code. If I understand correctly, this bot can be neat for those who want to get into making their own algos?

**Breaking Equity**

Breaking Equity lets users test their own algos first and check out example strategies before trading live. The site mentions that users can test their algos by checking against historical data. It’s also targeted towards beginners and requires no coding knowledge which I think is interesting?

**EquBot**

An automated (AI) technical analysis charting platform. Spots trendlines, S/R, pattern formations, etc. It’s open to retail investors and has very reasonable fees and charges. You can’t however subscribe to newsletters or participate in their chat rooms. 

**Quadency**

Quadency provides both auto and manual tools to customize trading bots. Users can choose different robots and modify them to their needs which I think is a neat feature."

stocks,"The risk associated with goodwill Goodwill is the present value of the excess paid for businesses representing acquired intangible assets.  The first time I heard of it was a number of years ago in a business class, but the real risks associated with it have taken a while to resonate.  I was recently going over a company that looked great.  Their profit margins are good, revenue is stable, expenses are somewhat predictable and most of the Wall Street ratios were better than satisfactory.  But when it came to the balance sheet, I noticed that a quarter of assets were goodwill.

This may mean absolutely nothing to you or it may sound alarm bells in your head.  Goodwill generally does not represent something you can buy or sell, and when you can buy or sell it there are usually abstract estimations of its value.  Very occasionally can a goodwill item actually have an accurate number associated with it on the value it might be sold at.  Some examples of goodwill items are patents, relationships, and talent.

Goodwill must be depreciated over 40 or less years.  Other than that, the values produced are first tied to the business acquisition costs and then more tied to the opinions of auditors and internal accountants. 

My old corporate finance textbook recommends that when analyzing the balance sheet, try removing goodwill​​ and maybe the same value from shareholders equity and see what it does to the company's overall health.  It may be a decisive factor in reducing your exposure to risk and financial heartache.  This correlation between goodwill and shareholders equity is entirely fictional because goodwill is not attributable to SHE directly, but the exercise may nonetheless make the company look much more risky.  For the company I was looking at, it certainly made a difference.

The company I was looking at when I came across these figures was Clorox if you would like to see for yourself.  The figures are from year end 2020."

stocks,"As a trader/investor there are bad days, weeks, months, even quarters.. We rarely have bad years, so please do not get down on yourself Good evening everyone. I thought it was important to go over this very important topic because I have read a lot about this all over Reddit. Some of the Elite Traders are going thru this. I am front lines with them on a daily basis. I wanted to tell everyone and anyone that it is ok, even the best of us have bad days, weeks, months, quarters....but rarely a year/years. I have been trading since very late 1994 and there is no way I can tell you everything was fine and dandy. The dot com crash of 2000 where I lost 75% off my peak was a true learning experience, and that has never happened again. But yes, I too have bad days, weeks or months. Last year with covid hit I was down about 25%, and that is because I was about 50% cash, had I been all in stocks I would have been down 40-50%...There are alot of lessons learned each time we are down.

It is fair to measure yourself against an index like the SP500 because since its creation it has been up 8% year over year.. However, if last month you were down, and the SP was up 3% it isnt fair to be down on yourself over this! It is cap weighted index where APPL accounts for nearly 25-30% alone! AAPL accounts for 20 of the Nasdaq 100! I too, was down the last few weeks when the market turned upside down. Give yourself some time before you measure yourself against an index or another trader. Do not be so down on yourself and follow the course.

If you want to measure yourself and get angry just look at 50% of the Nasdaq 100 that is off 33-50% off their highs.. Most of us trade tech and growth. Great company's always come back to make newer highs especially if they make cash and have earnings. So if your account is down even 50% but you are down on something solid rest assured it will come back 33-50%, Earnings season kicks off this week. And as long as you have something with earnings if the stock has been beaten down, dont fret this is the perfect time for your company to fight for proper valuation. (TCOM, SGEN, WBA, PTON, ZM, PDD) there are many more that are slammed off their highs, PDD is off 55%! If the company is solid think of this as a blip on the map....

If you are using the market to give you steady income daily, weekly it will be a roller coaster ride. Remember, a stock is a live auction, it rarely tracks the company performance in real time, and momentum/speculation moves stocks faster. That means it is very hard to always be right every single trading day my friends. Do not be so hard on yourself and it is very hard to have a steady flow of income unless you are working with sizeable capital. Dont fret my friends, earnings season is here and most of the stocks I trade have a low PE 20 or so, and they have consistently beat top and bottom line the last few quarters so I await the earnings reports! Please do not be down on yourself just yet.... the earnings reports will give solace! If you have a speculative stock with no earnings, and they lose money and burn cash good luck!"

Started invested after making most of my gains from GME in January. Disappointed in my returns in VTI and DIS, I am looking to possibly invest the rest of my cash, sell DIS/VTI if a better opportunity comes up or sit on it till the next pullback/correction. I would probably invest in some of my watch list or current stocks but they feel a bit pricey right now, so I would like some recommendations so I can at least research and add to my list. Advice is welcome, I buy when price feels right and always when a dip happens, I invest $2000 every month."

stocks,"My first real attempt at DD I’ve made both good and bad investments over the past year based on what others have said, but I’ve been trying to get better at doing my own research. So recently I’ve decided to do my DD on a stock called Allegr.o Micro.systems Inc. I’m not sure which subs allow certain companies to be mentioned so I placed random periods in the name to be safe. Also, I’m not trying to hype people up on this stock, I’m just using it as an example. I got my information from Yahoo finance.

Anyways, here goes.

Revenue: $591 million
Net Income: $17 million
Assets: $747 million
Liabilities: $160 million
Equity: $587 million
Debt: $25 million
Debt/Equity Ratio : 0.043

The past four years on Yahoo finance shows both revenue and earnings in the positives. I didn’t crunch number for YOY data simply because the numbers have been positive. The stock is currently $27.53. I didn’t do the P/E ratio just because I keep hearing that it doesn’t matter as much, especially based on last year. I ended up buying a few shares because the numbers are good and I don’t hear much about it on here or other sites, so I figured I may have found a good company to hold onto that many people may not have heard about yet.

I wanted to post this so I can see if I’m on the right track at predicting good companies on my own. Please let me know if there’s anything else I should look at when doing DD as well. Any advice would be appreciated."

stocks,"Branson Completes Virgin Galactic Flight, Aiming to Open Up Space Tourism https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/11/science/richard-branson-virgin-galactic-space.html?smid=url-share

SPACEPORT AMERICA, N.M. — Soaring more than 50 miles into the hot, glaringly bright skies above New Mexico, Richard Branson at last fulfilled a dream that took decades to realize: He can now call himself an astronaut.

On Sunday morning, a small rocket plane operated by Virgin Galactic, which Mr. Branson founded in 2004, carried him and five other people to the edge of space and back.

More than an hour later, a Mr. Branson took the stage to celebrate. “The whole thing was magical,” he said.

Mr. Branson’s flight reinforces the hopes of space enthusiasts that routine travel to the final frontier may soon be available to private citizens, not just the professional astronauts of NASA and other space agencies. Another billionaire with his own rocket company — Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon — has plans to make a similar jaunt to the edge of space in nine days.

In each case, billionaire entrepreneurs are risking injury or death to fulfill their childhood aspirations — and advance the goal of making human spaceflight unexceptional.

“They’re putting their money where their mouth is, and they’re putting their body where their money is,” said Eric Anderson, chairman of Space Adventures Limited, a company that charters launches to orbit. “That’s impressive, frankly.”

At 8:40 a.m. Mountain time, a carrier aircraft, with the rocket plane, named V.S.S. Unity, tucked underneath, rose off the runway and headed to an altitude of about 45,000 feet. There, Unity was released, and a few moments later, its rocket motor ignited, accelerating the space plane on an upward arc.

Although Unity had made three previous trips to space, this was its first launch that resembled a full commercial flight of the sort that Virgin Galactic has promised to offer the general public, with two pilots — David Mackay and Michael Masucci — and four more crew members including Mr. Branson.

This flight resembled a party for Virgin Galactic and the nascent space tourism business. Guests included Elon Musk, the founder of SpaceX; Michelle Lujan Grisham, the governor of New Mexico; and about 60 customers who have paid for future Virgin Galactic flights.

Stephen Colbert of the CBS program “The Late Show” introduced segments of the webcast that included some live video from inside the spaceship. After the landing, Khalid performed a new song.

When the fuel was spent, Unity continued to coast upward to an altitude of 53.5 miles. The four people in back unbuckled and experienced about four minutes of floating before returning to their seats.

Mr. Branson was accompanied in the cabin by Beth Moses, the company’s chief astronaut instructor; Colin Bennett, lead operations engineer; and Sirisha Bandla, vice president of government affairs and research operations.

As the space plane re-entered the atmosphere, the downward pull of gravity resumed. Unity glided to a landing back at the spaceport.

For well over a decade, Mr. Branson, the irreverent 70-year-old British billionaire who runs a galaxy of Virgin companies, has said he believes that commercial flights will soon begin. So did the 600 or so customers of Virgin Galactic who have paid $200,000 or more for their tickets to space and are still waiting. So did the taxpayers of New Mexico who paid $220 million to build Spaceport America, a futuristic vision in the middle of the desert, in order to attract Mr. Branson’s company.

After years and years of unmet promises, Virgin Galactic may begin flying the first paying passengers next year after two more test flights. But with tickets costing hundreds of thousands of dollars, this experience will, for now, remain out of financial reach for most people.

Founding a space exploration company was perhaps an unsurprising step for Mr. Branson, who has made a career — and a fortune estimated at $6 billion — building flashy upstart businesses that he promotes with a showman’s flair.

What became his Virgin business empire began with a small record shop in central London in the 1970s before Mr. Branson parlayed it into Virgin Records, the home of acts like the Sex Pistols, Peter Gabriel and more. In 1984, he was a co-founder of what became Virgin Atlantic, to challenge British Airways.

The Virgin Group branched out into a mobile-phone service, a passenger railway and a line of hotels. Not all have performed flawlessly. Two of his airlines filed for insolvency during the pandemic last year, while few today remember his ventures into soft drinks, cosmetics or lingerie.

The spaceflight company was of a piece with Mr. Branson’s penchant for highflying pursuits like skydiving and hot-air ballooning. And unlike many of the Virgin Group’s businesses, Virgin Galactic has been a major focus of Mr. Branson’s.

Virgin Galactic joined the New York Stock Exchange in 2019 after merging with a publicly traded investment fund, giving it a potent source of new funds to compete with deep-pocket competitors — and publicity, with Mr. Branson marking its trading debut at the exchange in one of the company’s flight suits.

The Virgin Group retains a 24 percent stake in Virgin Galactic.

Virgin Galactic’s space plane is a scaled-up version of SpaceShipOne, which in 2004 captured the $10 million Ansari X Prize as the first reusable crewed spacecraft built by a nongovernmental organization to make it to space twice in two weeks.

Mr. Branson initially predicted commercial flights would begin by 2007. But development of the larger craft, SpaceShipTwo, stretched out.

The first SpaceShipTwo vehicle, V.S.S. Enterprise, crashed during a test flight in 2014, killing one of the pilots. Virgin Galactic was then grounded until Unity was completed a year and a half later.

In 2019, Virgin Galactic came close to another catastrophe when a seal on a rear horizontal stabilizer ruptured because a new thermal protection film had been improperly installed.
The mishap was revealed this year in the book “Test Gods: Virgin Galactic and the Making of a Modern Astronaut” by Nicholas Schmidle, a staff writer at The New Yorker. The book quotes Todd Ericson, then the vice president for safety and test at Virgin Galactic, saying, “I don’t know how we didn’t lose the vehicle and kill three people.”

Mr. Bezos’ flight is to take place about 200 miles to the southeast of Spaceport America in Van Horn, Texas, where his rocket company, Blue Origin, launches its New Shepard rocket and capsule.

Although Blue Origin has yet to fly any people on New Shepard, 15 successful uncrewed tests of the fully automated system convinced the company it would be safe to put Mr. Bezos on the first flight with people aboard.

He will be joined by his brother, Mark, and Mary Wallace Funk, an 82-year-old pilot. In the 1960s, she was among a group of women who passed the same rigorous criteria that NASA used for selecting astronauts, but the space agency at the time had no interest in selecting women as astronauts. A fourth unnamed passenger paid $28 million in an auction for one of the seats.

Neither Blue Origin nor Virgin Galactic flights go high enough or fast enough to enter orbit around Earth. Rather, these suborbital flights are more like giant roller coaster rides that allow passengers to float for a few minutes while admiring a view of Earth against the black backdrop of space.

Mr. Bezos’ company emphasized the rivalry with Virgin Galactic for space tourism passengers in a tweet on Friday. Blue Origin highlighted differences between its New Shepard rocket and Virgin Galactic’s SpaceShipTwo including the fact that New Shepard flies higher, above the altitude of 100 kilometers, or about 62 miles, that is often regarded as the boundary of space. However, the United States Air Force and the Federal Aviation Administration set the boundary at 50 miles.

The company also noted the size of the New Shepard capsule’s windows, and called Virgin Galactic’s Unity “a high-altitude plane” in contrast to New Shepard’s rocket.
Mr. Bezos on Sunday congratulated Mr. Branson and his fellow crew on their flight. “Can’t wait to join the club!” he added in an Instagram post.

Blue Origin has not yet announced a ticket price, and Virgin Galactic’s earlier quoted fare of $250,000 may rise. But on Sunday after his trip, Mr. Branson announced a sweepstakes that will give away two seats on a future Virgin Galactic flight.

Joy-riding tourists will not be the only passengers on future suborbital flights. Both companies are selling flights to organizations including the Italian Air Force where scientists will conduct experiments that take advantage of the minutes of microgravity.

The era of nonprofessional astronauts regularly heading to orbit may also begin in the coming year. Jared Isaacman, a 38-year-old billionaire, is essentially chartering a rocket and spacecraft from SpaceX for a three-day trip to orbit that is scheduled for September.

In December, Space Adventures has arranged for a Japanese fashion entrepreneur, Yusaku Maezawa, and Yozo Hirano, a production assistant, to launch on a Russian Soyuz rocket on a 12-day mission that will go to the International Space Station.

Another company, Axiom Space in Houston, is arranging a separate trip to the space station that will launch as soon as January.

The orbital trips are too expensive for anyone except the superwealthy — Axiom’s three customers are paying $55 million each — while suborbital flights might be affordable to those who are merely well off.

But how many people are willing to spend as much as some houses cost for a few minutes of space travel?

Carissa Christensen, founder and chief executive of Bryce Space and Technology, an aerospace consulting firm, thinks there will be plenty. “Based on previous ticket sales, surveys and interviews,” she said in an email, “we see strong demand signals for multiple hundreds of passengers a year at current prices, with potential for thousands if prices drop significantly.”

Mr. Anderson of Space Adventures is less certain.

“Per minute, it’s like a thousand times more expensive than an orbital flight,” he said. “It’s crazy.”

Two decades ago, Space Adventures did sell suborbital flights including a ticket to Ms. Funk, who goes by Wally. “Wally Funk was one of our first customers,” Mr. Anderson said. “That would have been like 1998.”

The ticket price then was $98,000.

At one point, about 200 people signed up for suborbital flights, but none of the promised suborbital rocket companies was able to get their space planes close to flight. Space Adventures returned the money to Ms. Funk and the others.

Now this unproven suborbital market has whittled down to a battle of billionaires — Mr. Branson and Mr. Bezos.

“If anybody can make money and make the market work for suborbital, it’s Branson and Bezos,” Mr. Anderson said. “They have the reach and the cachet.”"

TLDR at bottom

I decided to try a back testing experiment where I would look at current and recent operations of a company ($GIL: Gildan) and come up with my own five year estimates for growth taking into account quantitative and qualitative factors.  The process was to look at old financials and come up with my judgement.  I have never analyzed $GIL before and I knew nothing about their financial state past or present. I read their annual reports in order from oldest to newest in order to maintain an unbiased opinion.  

I know that some of you will point out that I could have just said that I did this in order to make me look smart by having accurate growth estimates.  I assure you that the point of this post is to highlight the discrepancies between predictions and reality, and hopefully add something to your investing toolbox for you to think about.

**Ten years ago analysis:**

**(2011)** The balance sheet has a good structure.  Current assets along can cover all liabilities quite easily.  Debts are not a problem.  There has been recent sales and earnings with good profit margins hovering around 10%.  Operating cash flow is generating consistent cash flow.  Net cash flow was negative attributable to a large business acquisition so this year net cash flow was negative but on average could be expected to reach 100M annually.  

Acquisitions:

* The business they acquired was a sock supplier for 350M at a net asset premium of 137M.  
* They also spent 15M on 12M assets on a vertically integrated T-Shirt manufacturing facility in bangladesh.

Inventories are mostly finished goods (About 80% are finished goods) with the remainder being materials, spare parts, and partially finished goods.  Manufacturing equipment is about half of PPE and increased by 100M in the last year.  Goodwill increased by roughly the value excess of assets in the acquisitions.  They have an 800M RLOC with 209M drawn @ 2.3%.

Based on their past income statement data, I would not say it is unreasonable to expect 100M in revenue growth per year over the next five years.  They have increased sales by 300M per year, but to stay conservative I will use the figure of 100M YoY or about 5%. Earnings and OCF will follow this trend.  The balance sheet will stay strong, hopefully with the same structure of assets as we see now. Depending on their appetite, debt may increase if they keep up with large acquisitions.

What actually happened:

2016: 

\-Current assets went up about 500M, or about 60%.  Overall assets increased by 1B

\- Liabilities doubled, Retained earnings increased by about 50%

\- Sales increased by about 1.3B, or 250M per year. Overall increase of about 12% yearly

\- Earnings increased by about 4% yearly.  OCF increased by about 50%, or 8% YoY.

Their financial health got stronger overall.  Sales and OCF did much better than expected, and earnings slightly underperformed.  The operating environments during this period were quite good.  The world economy was experiencing growth after the financial meltdown in 2008 that was above average.  

**Five years ago analysis:**

**(2016)** The balance sheet has good structure.  Current assets are almost double liabilities.  Most current assets are inventory. Assuming that of these only finished products will be converted into cash and receivables nets 640M, which still covers all liabilities.  The company is on track to have almost no need for debt.  Sales are large compared to the balance sheet, and profit margins are and have been above 10%.  OCF is good, but ideally this number would be about 20% larger to cover current asset requirements with a larger debt coverage margin of safety.

They recently acquired a shirt manufacturer for 112M with 14M goodwill.  They also paid 102M for the assets + 26M goodwill in a lingerie company, the first acquisition of this sort.  

It would be reasonable to say that revenue can grow by about 250M per year or about 8% YoY. This is about half of the growth seen in the recent two years, so it is considered a conservaitve estimate.  Net income will likely trail this trend by 20-30% earnings growth has been slightly slower than revenue growth.  Earnings growth can be estimated to be 4-5% YoY, and OCF could follow this closely.  If they manage money right, total liabilities could shrink to ⅓ of total assets in the coming years, although debt may rise as a number if they continue their current acquisition habits.

What actually happened:

2021:

* Sales are at 2B, about a 35% decrease from 2016
* Net income is -220M
* Operating cash flow have decreased by 40%
* All three of my predicted growth rates were useless.  Revenue from 2019 year end was also much lower than the growth rates would have dictated. 
* Instead of selling more shears, they issued one billion in debt payable over the next six years with an average interest rate of 2.8%

It is clear that in periods of stable growth, it is much easier to be optimistic. Who would have been able to predict the pandemic? Certainly not me.  But that is not an excuse for being wrong.  This was a very interesting activity for me to do, and hopefully this can serve as a reminder that predictions and reality can very possibly have zero correlation.  The low growth in 2019 was not related to the pandemic, further proving that predictions - your own or from others or even professionals - have the possibility of being dangerously wrong.

TLDR:I tried to look at really old financials and predict what would happen in the companies near future.  It worked well from 2011-2016, but completely failed between 2016-2021."

stocks,"Why the selloff on Thursday and immediate bounce back on Friday? With all indices red on Thursday , I searched for explanations on WSJ, Bloomberg, Barrons, etc and the general consensus was that the rise of the delta variant, FOMC meeting notes indicating possible tapering sooner rather than later and overvaluation were likely triggers for the selloff.  But none of this is new.  We've heard for weeks that the delta variant is rising overseas and domestically, we've heard that some Fed Presidents prefer tapering sooner and we've heard for months on end about ridiculous CAPE and P/E ratios so why this sudden dump on Thursday?

stocks,"What high interest rates COULD do to different industries This is all my own opinion, but I did some deep research into each industry and tried to make this post as objective as possible.  I hope you get something out of this!

&amp;#x200B;

In general:  In high interest rates, bonds do better and stocks do worse than in lower interest rates.  High interest rates means more difficulty growing. It also implies the risk free rate is high so bond yields must rise with it in order to have any demand for corporate paper.

Basic Materials:

The interest rate to commodity price index is inverted.  This is because the demand for commodities falls with the level of economic activity.  This can be seen quite clearly by comparing a chart of interest rates with commodity prices.

The implications of high interest rates are divided across the industry.  Commodity producers will have more difficulty staying profitable and expanding operations.  Cash generation will be severely strained.  Commodity buyers on the other hand will find that expenses are much lower and it easier to get competitive prices.  There are some material producers that will suffer less than others.  In general, smaller companies suffer more because the larger ones are more capable of providing the most competitive prices.

Communication services:

Communications services do well in low interest rates, and tend to struggle in higher rates.  This sector is generally the most overpriced and most leveraged.  Stock prices in this sector may decrease more than the average market does.  In addition to lower stock prices, companies that require a lot of leverage will have difficulty expanding or continuing operations.  Established companies that have less capital intensive operations will fare much better, but still won’t be able to come up with the same revolutionary technologies that come from lower interest rate environments.

Technology:

This sector is unique because it is much newer and has not been exposed to high interest rates.  If the current environment of startups are extended, many startups will find difficulty finding funding and small companies with high debt will face similar problems.  For larger companies, a unique situation is presented.  These companies are known for constant acquisitions and with high interest rates, all of the talent in niche tech businesses will suddenly look much more attractive.

It is possible that the mega cap tech companies will be nearly unaffected because of their massive operating cash flows that are vital to normal life.  Many companies in tech have become very large with a low interest rate for the entirety of their existence.  It is possible that these companies suffer more than older companies of similar operations and size because of a lack of experience operating at higher interest rates.

Industrials:

These companies have mixed implications.  On one end, commodities and other material input are cheaper, but on the other end there is less demand for industrial products in an economic slowdown.  Revenue and cost of goods sold could be expected to decrease, creating smaller, more profitable businesses.

A nice way to think about this is to examine the airplane manufacturing industry in a high interest rate environment.  The manufacturer can acquire the materials and possibly prefabs for the plane for cheaper.  The gross margin on the individual plane is higher as a result, but in the general economy, consumer activity is lower, so there is less traveling and a resulting lower demand for aircraft.

Health Care:

Health care is much less volatile than the average market because the demand for healthcare services is mostly disjoint from economic activity.  The main concerns in health care are shared with the rest of the economy - mostly issues arising in debt refinancing and upgrading or acquiring fixed assets.

Utilities:

Utilities generally underperform in high interest rates.  They take on more debt, require consistent servicing of fixed assets, and are slower to increase revenue than other industries.  When operating conditions are staying similar (utility costs for consumers are not increasing much) and interest rates are high, utilities have a much more difficult time covering capex and depreciation.

Consumer staples:

Consumer staples are historically less volatile than most of the market.  Consumers may not be buying luxury goods or a second home at high interest rates, but like healthcare, consumer staples are not things that are optional for most people.  \[Most?\] Consumers are not going to stop purchasing food and toiletries just because their variable rate debts are becoming more costly.

Finance:

Finance tends to do well in high interest rate environments.  They are able to write higher rate loans, and demand for loans increases.  Insurance historically issued higher premiums.  Financial firms can be viewed as the most obvious beneficiaries of high interest rates at the cost of most other industries."

stocks,"Do you purchase/use products from companies you own shares just cause you own their shares? For example, let's say you own shares from Colgate-Palmolive ($CL). If you were shopping for toothpaste, would you purchase Colgate because you own shares from the company? Or would you purchase a different brand and not think about it?"
stocks,"Are call debit spreads on the total market (spy, vti, voo, etc) better than the total market? I noticed when I was playing around with different options prices that a $1 call debit spread at the money costs $50. For example, Spy(Currently priced at $435) buying a $435 call and selling a $436 call dated 1 year out would cost $50, but if by the end of that period spy is above 436, the contract is worth $100. If it is below 435 then it would expire worthless. So more or less your are betting that spy increases over a year at 1:1 odds.

I don't understand this. While it possible to lose your entire underlying, if someone were to make this debit spread purchase every month over the past 35 years instead of just purchasing the underlying they would be up significantly over just buy and hold. It would never work to put your portfolio on these positions as they can go to zero, BUT it would make sense to make this ""bet"" monthly instead of buying spy as part of a DCA strategy using work income. 

If the market is always on a slight path upwards, than I would win far more of these spreads than lose. The only way I can think this wouldn't work over a long time period is if SPY decreased year over year for 5 years or so, but the longest stretch that these contracts would expire worthless was 36 months. There is certainly risk, but it seems like the expected value of the spreads should be higher than $50.

Could I have 5 different orders lined up, where it would only trigger one order, based on which stock drops to the acquisition price first. Obviously, one concern is that multiple stocks could potentially hit said acquisition price at the same second, and then what does the automated system do in this regard. Well, I would imagine that you could have a pecking order, so that if Google, Facebook, Nividia and Amazon all hit my strike price simultaneously, then you'd have a Tier order, that it would automatically select your preferred stock over the other ones. Does TD Ameritrade have something like this, because I can't find it if it does. I tried having multiple orders at the same time and it wouldn't let me do this. Tell me that this must be a thing, but that TD Ameritrade simply doesn't offer this type of order. Who does?"

A couple of months back, the play was to load up on stocks that were held down due to the chip shortage. They crushed the market as the fear subsided.

stocks,"Why VRTX is a Deep Value Cash-Flow Machine This is my first time writing a company analysis/dd so feel free to leave any criticism in the comments. Hope this analysis is helpful to some of you. 

Vertex Pharmaceuticals is a large-cap American biopharmaceutical company which uses rational drug design to develop treatments for several disorders. The stock has been long overlooked by retail investors but is no stranger to institutions -- massive hedge funds such as Renaissance Technologies, Point72 and Man Group are all long with large positions. Currently, there are several catalysts for growth in the upcoming years for Vertex. 

Here is some analysis regarding Vertex’s operations, financials and future growth prospects…

&amp;#x200B;

1.  TRIKAFTA

*“Cystic fibrosis, a rare, progressive, life-threatening disease, results in the formation of thick mucus that builds up in the lungs, digestive tract, and other parts of the body. It leads to severe respiratory and digestive problems as well as other complications such as infections and diabetes. Cystic fibrosis is caused by a defective protein that results from mutations in the CFTR gene. While there are approximately 2,000 known mutations of the CFTR gene, the most common mutation is the F508del mutation. Trikafta is a combination of three drugs that target the defective CFTR protein. It helps the protein made by the CFTR gene mutation function more effectively. Currently available therapies that target the defective protein are treatment options for some patients with cystic fibrosis, but many patients have mutations that are ineligible for treatment. Trikafta is the first approved treatment that is effective for cystic fibrosis patients 12 years and older with at least one F508del mutation, which affects 90% of the population with cystic fibrosis or roughly 27,000 people in the United States” ­*– US Food and Drug Administration 

Trikafta is the first FDA approved treatment for cystic fibrosis which is capable of treating 90% of patients with the disorder. Vertex currently has a firm economic moat on medicinal treatment for cystic fibrosis as it is the only company with FDA approved drugs for treating the disorder. Trikafta accounts for 70% of Vertex’s revenues and has the potential to drive far more profit for the company with the massive expanding global cystic fibrosis therapeutics market. Grand View Research expects the global cystic fibrosis therapeutics market to grow at a rate of 16.7% CAGR until 2025. Vertex could see growth which far exceeds that of this market due to its ever-growing share in the market. Essentially, the global cystic fibrosis therapeutics market growth rate + Trikafta’s market share growth rate would equate to Vertex’s revenue growth rate with Trikafta. With the drug’s increasingly large presence abroad due to the new approval in Canada as well as across Europe in several countries (57% increase in product revenue in Europe from 2020-2021), Trikafta could become an absolute cash-flow machine for Vertex. At the cost of $311,000 for Trikfta, Vertex could mass up to $8.4B in annual revenue if it were to capture the entire US market share alone. While the drug brought in just over $3.8B in 2020, there is still lots of room for Trikafta in Vertex’s domestic market, not to mention the great potential to scale internationally which has already been initiated.

2.  GROWTH

Revenue YoY Growth: **33.10%** **LTM**

Diluted EPS YoY Growth: **81.55%** **LTM**

Cash from Operations YoY Growth: **63.03%** **LTM**

Past 5 years Annual Earnings Growth: **53.9%**

As Trikafta’s patent has 16 years until expiry (expiry in 2037), Vertex’s largest source of revenue is here to stay and will continue to grow with the increasingly large demand for such treatment. Any new advances in pipeline for Vertex would also drive tremendous growth for additional revenues. On average, analysts are forecasting earnings growth greater than 20% for the upcoming year, however, with the average earnings surprise of 11.65% from the last four quarters, I believe that earnings growth &gt;30% is fair and to be expected.

Vertex’s high return on equity of 23.0% exceeds the industry average of 16.6% which demonstrates the company’s ability to successfully generate income and growth from equity financing – another positive and promising sign for future growth.

3.  VALUATION

VRTX has become increasingly cheap over the past few years. The stock has risen significantly in the same time that its P/E multiple has significantly decreased. The stock now trades at 18.81x earnings 15.96x forward earnings, representing a 1.59 PEG. This puts VRTX far below the Nasdaq biotechnology industry average of 30x earnings. VRTX is currently extremely cheap based on the most common valuation metrics.

Based on a discounted cash-flow analysis of VRTX\*, an intrinsic value of $406.58 can be extrapolated which presents a &gt;50% discount to its current share price of $197.74 (assumptions include a discount rate of 6.5% based on the calculation cost of equity).

This is all to say that VRTX has some serious deep value and a return to industry average earnings multiples or simply maintaining a similar valuation based on earnings would provide drastic upside (&gt;50%) based on future outlook.

&amp;#x200B;

4.  BALANCE SHEET

Quick Ratio: **4.20**

Current Ratio: **4.40**

Debt/Equity: **0.00**

LT Debt/Equity: **0.06**

Vertex Pharmaceuticals’ balance sheet is extremely strong with minimal debt relative to cash and current assets. The company has also made it clear that they are looking to use their large cash reserve for the acquisition of both drugs and of other pharmaceutical/biotech companies. There is virtually no risk debt-wise for Vertex – a rise in interest rates would not pose troubles to the company at all. Vertex’s current financial health is certainly the best in the biotech industry. 

&amp;#x200B;

5.  RESEARCH &amp; DEVELOPMENT

Vertex is in the process of developing several breakthrough therapies for serious diseases and has shown promising success with many of their clinical trials. FDA approval for any of these products would be highly significant for Vertex and extremely rewarding for shareholders. In the event that Vertex is successful in their cell therapy for type-1 diabetes, they could potentially cure type-1 diabetes and thus would consequently capture a large share of T1D market that is expected to grow to $24B by 2029\*. Vertex is continuing to advance in the development of molecular, cellular and genetic therapies aimed at treating many serious diseases. Overall, Vertex is in the process of developing revolutionary treatments that could significantly disrupt the biotech industry. Below is the stated progress on Vertex’s R&amp;D from the latest 10k…

*Beta Thalassemia and Sickle Cell Disease*

In December, we and our collaborator, CRISPR, announced positive interim data from 10 people with TDT or SCD treated with CTX001 and that 20 people with severe hemoglobinopathies have been dosed with CTX001 in the ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical trials. Enrollment and dosing are ongoing, and completion of enrollment in both clinical trials is expected in 2021.

*Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency*

Enrollment is ongoing in a Phase 2 proof-of-concept clinical trial for the corrector VX-864. We expect data from this clinical trial in the first half of 2021.

We discontinued development of VX-814, our first corrector, based on the safety and pharmacokinetic profile of VX-814 observed in a Phase 2 clinical trial.

*APOL1-Mediated Kidney Diseases*

Enrollment is ongoing in a Phase 2 proof-of-concept clinical trial designed to evaluate the reduction of proteinuria in people with APOL1-mediated FSGS after treatment with VX-147. We expect data from this clinical trial in 2021.

*Type 1 Diabetes*

We are developing a cell therapy designed to replace insulin-producing islet cells in patients with T1D. We are pursuing two programs for the transplant of these functional islets into patients: transplantation of islet cells alone, using immunosuppression to protect the implanted cells, and implantation of the islet cells inside a novel immunoprotective device. In January 2021, the FDA cleared our IND for VX-880, the islet cells alone program. We expect to initiate a Phase 1/2 clinical trial evaluating this program in the first half of 2021. This clinical trial will involve an infusion of fully differentiated, functional islet cells, and chronic administration of concomitant immunosuppressive therapy, to protect the islet cells from immune rejection. 

*Investment in External Innovation*

\-  We entered into a collaboration with Skyhawk Therapeutics, Inc., or Skyhawk, for the discovery and development of novel small molecules that modulate RNA splicing for the treatment of serious diseases. 

\-  We entered into a new collaboration with Moderna, Inc., or Moderna, aimed at the discovery and development of lipid nanoparticles and mRNAs that can deliver gene-editing therapies to lung cells for the treatment of CF. 

\-  We entered into a collaboration with Affinia Therapeutics, Inc., or Affinia, to gain access to a novel library of AAV capsids to support on our ongoing research and development efforts in genetic therapies, including DMD, DM1 and CF.

**TDLR:**

Vertex Pharmaceuticals presents remarkable upside for growth with their current products which are continuing to gain market share in an ever-growing therapeutics market, as well as with several breakthrough therapies which have shown to have promising results in recent clinical trials. Such high growth prospects paired with an undervalued company with solid financials makes for a great investment especially at the cheap price it is currently trading at.

The S&amp;P 500 is a market cap weighted index composing the 500 largest stocks as measured by market capitalization. As such, the price of each stock is multiplied by it's weight in the index and summed with all other stocks to determined the index's value. Accordingly, the same method is used to determine the index's PE ratio. The current PE ratio of the index is 22.7x. Of this amount, TSLA contributes almost 10% to the overall total. TSLA has a PE ratio of approximately 164x and it's current weight is about 1.37%. This means that excluding TSLA, the index would have a PE ratio of approximately 20.5x."

This way there is no risk of assignment, even though you should always have the money to cover. But yeah, short slightly otm call options with 0dte, match this with some technical analysis on a 1hr, target $15-30, and you’re golden. Thank you for coming to my Ted talk 😋"

I've been seeing questions from new investors lately that are wondering about big tech and what to invest in. In particular, of Amazon, Apple, Microsoft and Google, it seems like MSFT has been the resounding favorite. It seems that way to me at least; I'd love to run a poll to get a better count but that's not an option. 

So, my question for everyone is: Let's say you had $5K to invest in only one of four names, Amazon, Microsoft , Apple or Google. And after buying the shares you wouldn't have access to your account or any information for 5 years. No news, no earnings, no guidance... just a blind leap of faith and then you open your present in 5 years and see what you got. Which of the 4 would you pick? I'd love to post the totals in a week or so if there are enough responses.

Me personally, I don't own any of these names (here comes the self-serving part) but plan to. I just can't make up my mind. I have been leaning Amazon, but still can't make up my mind. So I need all of you to tell me which dress makes me look fat, and which one is going to make a billionaire in 5 years (no pressure).

Thanks!"

Introduction:

This is my First DD, so please be kind while I figure out my style, and how I focus on topics. 

I should note, that I am not a financial advisor/adviser or a consultant, and that this is not financial advice. Always seek sound financial advice from your consultant or financial advisor before investing in the stock market. I am a grapefruit, and the stock market is a casino.

Disclosure:  No positions current in this stock, planning to go Long, likely for between 100 to 500 shares.

Why did I pick this stock? I’m running an experiment reviewing various services’ “recommended” buy stocks over time, and this one has been turning a profit when almost all others are in the red. Pft. Some recommended hot buy stocks, all down. But that got me to look closer. Thursdays market dump? This stock slid, then immediately was bought up with a climb all throughout the day. Hmm. Caught my eye little stock. Zack’s says you’re just a hold now, so why are you doing well this week? Tradingview says RXRX is a strong buy.

They are Growing: 

Jul 1 2021 Recursion Pharmaceuticals (RXRX) said Thursday it has signed a lease agreement with Vestar for an additional 100,000 square feet of space to double the size of its Salt Lake City headquarters. 

In 2018, the biotech firm signed a lease for 100,000 square feet of space at The Gateway complex in downtown Salt Lake City.

Summary: If you like tech, AI, and Biotechnology stocks – this might be the investment for you. A budding company on the market, but with the initial startup over, this company is planting itself and growing quickly.

Personal thoughts: I expect the company to post losses for another quarter or 2, until it is done expanding and growing, as it develops and takes on clients and furthers its technology. There may be a buying opportunity with the next earnings release if it posts another surprise loss greater than estimates (due to its expansions, partnerships, and Toronto location this quarter). RXRX has a low PB Ratio of under 3, utilizing TD’s fundamental Book Price. I intend to buy and hold Very LONG.

Alternatives and competitors: Relay $RLAY (Small molecule drug discovery), Pfizer and IBM Watson, Sanofi uses Exscientia AI, Roche Subsidiary Genentech uses AI (see the above Principals and the board of directors, some are from Roche and Genentech)."
stocks,"How do you conduct your DD? For every stock that I get into, it is most definitely a company that I know well of, use their products and/or believe in. For those plays that aren’t so up there in the public light, how do you conduct your due diligence for said stock?"
stocks,"Another one: Chinese antitrust regulator blocks Tencent's $5.3 billion video games merger https://www.msn.com/en-gb/money/other/chinese-antitrust-regulator-blocks-tencents-video-games-merger/ar-AALYO4O

The Chinese regulators seems to be serious with their crack down on the tech industry. 
After Alibaba (with Ant group), Didi just last week and now tencent, it seems no one is safe anymore. 
I guess this will bring tencent and other Chinese tech stocks further down on Monday.

I know you should buy when there is blood in the streets, but considering all the other problems with Chinese stock like ADRs which are not really shares of the companies, questionable accounting practices in china and basically the non existence of the rule of law, Holding Chinese (tech) Stocks long term seems to be really a bad idea, even with the relatively low PE and high growth potential of the companies."
stocks,"Are investors more emotional in stocks nowadays? Since techonology came, we’re being quoted of our stock by Mr. Market every second when the market opens and can easily manipulate our emotions to make our decisions.

I heard one of Warren Buffett sayings that retail investors will have a better investment decision if they’re only being quoted with their stock price once a year.

However, people are more educated nowadays due to access of free information about investing in stocks and they know what to do when their stock prices goes down, while the value the same, buy the dip. Although I know IQ is different from EQ, especially in investing.

My question is, do you think investors are emotional nowadays before the technology came?"
stocks,"A word to new investors: HOLD! I’ve been thinking about a post I read here recently. Basically, someone said they started buying stocks six months ago and have been in the red since until finally breaking even this week. As a beginner, it’s so difficult, because you’re excited and you understand the market returns 7-10% per year vs. nothing as cash. So six months later, when your carefully selected stocks stink, it feels bad, man.

I am here to tell you to HOLD your ridiculous stock, and to wrap your head around the idea that a LOT of people have been at this for a very long time. Your stocks are doing badly because people years before you thought the same thing you did: this is a great company! And they doubled, tripled, whatevered their money, and are now selling. This results in you having an unrealized loss or reduced unrealized gain that only becomes real IF YOU SELL. But you don’t have to realize it. Because you haven’t lost money. Your stock has simply lost its SHORT-TERM momentum. 

One of my recent stinkers has been TSM which I bought at the literal top in February. There are lots of stocks like this in tech, renewables, anything ARK. Same with crypto. And all for the same reason – people are cashing out! An analogy would be sitting at a slot machine right after somebody else just hit the jackpot. Bummer in the short term, but it’s still a good machine! Back to TSM, here’s a scenario: Imagine someone buys at the literal top in January 2018 @ $46. Then the stock drops and is stuck below that for 20 months straight until October 2019 when it finally breaks above $46. From there, it hangs out around the low 50s for several months until July 2020 when it nearly TRIPLES in value peaking above $140 in Feb 21. Sure, the pattern mimics what happened in the broader market, but that’s the point. A TSM holder would be up over 250% today. That's sure better than 7-10%.

Right now, my human emotion is thinking “boo-hoo, I am still down now while others are doing well.” But that’s not what matters. For most people, buying individual stocks isn’t a game of making a quick buck. It’s a game of being capable, consciously and financially, to wait it out – sometime for years – for these kinds of gains. This concept was never explained to me, but I think it’s an important lesson for beginners so they don’t sell a good thing and get taken advantage of when they miss the rocket emoji."
stocks,LEAPS for leverage I'm thinking about liquidating 50% of my portfolio and buying DEEP ITM SPY CALLS expiring in 2023. Will sell OTM calls against it to reduce premium. How safe is this strategy and does anyone do this as 100% of their portfolio?
stocks,"Is there ever a time investing your money wouldn’t make sense because of potential taxes? For reference, I’ve been investing for around 2 years, 1 year seriously. I’ve been lucky so far to be up around 25%, and most of my stocks are companies I believe in or ETFs in industries I think have long term potential growth. I don’t think I’ll need access to it any time soon, but crazy things happen and I might.
So basically, this means I haven’t sold anything yet. I put in around $500 each week, I’m just worried when it comes time to sell I’m going to end up paying more in taxes than it’s worth to have the money invested.

Just want to make sure I’m not screwing over future me by not fully understanding the tax ramifications of selling stocks."
stocks,"$SJW DD: Water Company  

SJW Corp stands for Social Justice Warrior Corporation.  Their main line of business is holding and operating water utilities companies. HQ in San Jose  They originate in san jose and have 4 subsidiaries:

* San Jose water company provides water to 231 000 connections in san jose
* SJWNE has water companies in the northeast. They have 139 000 connections
* SJWTX provides 20 000 connections in Texas
* SJW Land owns land and develops it in Tennessee

1 connection can supply 1 standalone structure.  They serve about 1.54 Million people.

They have been acquiring some utility companies recently.  They also in a way get to determine the price of water.  This year they have made a request to increase their prices by 3%.  Because the Mexican government has been burning water, there will be less and less water each year because the Mexican government is burning water.

I am extremely bullish $SJW.  Their financial health is completely disjoint from the regular economy.  If you looked at a chart of their revenue, earnings, cash flows, asset/debt structure, buybacks/selloffs you wouldn't even notice the 2008 financial crisis.  They were completely unaffected by it.  When I do DD, I dig as deep as I can.  You can see the process I do in some of my older posts.  I am in the process of this for $SJW and things are looking very good for them as long as they can make it through 2021 without selling shares or taking out more than 180M in debt.

Boring:

They have revenue growth and never had negative earnings in the past 15 years.  Profit margins have been at least 20% over the past two decades and are at around 40% YTD. Their current debt structure is not sustainable, but It is looking much more manageable in the future.  They have also consistently been increasing their operating cash flows.  They have a lot of debt issues right now.  This is throwing off the D/E and current ratios.  Wall Street hates to see some of these values when they check their ratios so the stock is at a lower price than it should be and is being overlooked by the institutions.  Their returns are solid and should be expected to always be solid because they are so disjoint from economic conditions.  It’s not like anybody is going to decide to stop showering and washing the dishes just because your rent went up and milk is getting more expensive."
stocks,"Why should I do DD on stocks and not just follow hedge funds/smarter people than me? Hi stocks,

I’ve been thinking lately about developing my own portfolio of stocks, looking into potential growth areas and selecting certain stocks. 

However, I can’t do it myself. I don’t have the knowledge, brains, resources. So why don’t I just copy. I’ve realised I don’t need to be creative or inventive to be profitable investor I can just copy people who are better than me. 

So firstly, how do I find, say, the top 10 most profitable hedge funds or single investors over the last decade and identify the common stocks held by each and their portfolio allocations and just copy them. Is there a website I can use for this? 

Secondly, why wouldn’t I want to do this? What are the down sides? 

E.g. if the best 10 hedge funds invest in Microsoft with decent allocations, I’ll just put money in Microsoft and leave it. 

Thoughts?"
stocks,"Is There Still A Bullish Case For Spotify? Time Is Running Out. Let me start by saying that I love Spotify and have been using it for over seven years. Everything about the platform is great and like many others, I have no plans of switching. The algorithm is unlike anything I've experienced on a music streaming app and has helped me discover countless new artists and genres. I’m sure you have felt a similar experience. Unfortunately, none of these amazing features should allow an investor to turn a blind eye to an obscene valuation. As history has shown, Wall Street will eventually make you pay the price. People quickly forget that Pandora Media was one of the world’s leading internet radio providers before collapsing due to more competition, and eventually was bought by Sirius XM.

      Growing Sales Doesn't Justify its High Valuation. Spotify is currently valued as a high-margin, wide-moat business. Investors are willing to pay a premium now for profits that aren't expected for at least four to five years. Bulls love to only focus on the impressive revenue and MAU growth, huge podcast signings, and overall great product. The question I always follow up and ask is, “How much more room is there to grow?”. Spotify has already absorbed close to 35% of the music streaming market as of 2019 and with a number of new platforms emerging each year, it’s only going to get more competitive. Some reports are claiming that Spotify’s share has declined closer to 30% as of 2020 but these are difficult to verify.

      If Spotify can’t generate a profit now, when will they? Their explosive growth and exclusive content signings are costly and while it looks good in the near term, it doesn’t imply a sustainable business model. On top of that, Spotify’s high EV/EBITDA (can’t use profit margins since negative) imply it’s trading well above fair value vs. similar names such as Netflix, Sirius XM, or Apple.

      Some may argue that it is unfair comparing a low/negative EBITDA with companies that have stronger multiples, but to me, that is the point I'm trying to make. Spotify doesn't deserve this valuation given its low-margin business. If management can prove to investors that it can scale AND improve operating margins, then it will deserve the valuations of Netflix and Apple who already have 18-25% net income margins. 

      Royalty Fees Remain a Major Concern. One of the biggest things I feel Wall Street fails to effectively understand with Spotify is its painful royalty fee structure. 73-80% of the company's revenue is subject to this in a given year, and it isn't going anywhere. There are no economies of scale or optimization strategies that will fix this; it's a constant payment to recording owners such as Universal Music or Sony that eat up the vast majority of Spotify's revenue. Figure 3 shows Spotify’s unchanged gross margins for the last three years despite impressive top-line growth.

      It's even more surprising when you find out that Spotify is one of the worst paying streaming services out there. There isn’t much more room for management to decrease payouts or else they risk losing more market share.

      Why is that important you might ask? Well, one of the hottest topics in music streaming right now (has been for years) revolves around artists, who are demanding to be paid more and rightfully so. This does not bode well for Spotify’s low payout coupled with more streamers entering the market who will try to gain exclusive access from artists by paying them more. If Spotify decides to increase payouts to retain artists, it's only going to hurt their bottom line. 

      Competition From Apple Music Will continue to be an issue for Spotify. Earlier this year, Apple unveiled its lossless streaming and spatial audio which is essentially a new enhanced way to listen to your favorite artists. It's a relatively new feature that launched in June and I believe as more people become aware of its better high-resolution stream offering, there is potential for them to take more market share from Spotify. I’m not claiming to be a music expert, but many blogs/articles are out there touting Apple’s achievement and we have yet to hear from Spotify on their next move. They may match what Apple has released, but until then, it has become a new near-term risk for Spotify. 

      Don't Sleep on Spotify's Debt. Although Spotify currently generates a healthy operating cash flow, it's important to recognize the $1.8 billion in debt on its balance sheet. In early 2021, Spotify raised $1.3 billion in unsecured notes. For what exactly? Many are speculating on the uses. An acquisition? General corporate purposes? Paying out more to artists? That remains to be said, but regardless this adds a new risk factor to Spotify if it cannot execute on a plan to pay off these notes due in 2026. The company does have a history of getting out of a high debt situation. Prior to going public in 2018, Spotify had raised approximately $1 billion of convertible debt at a roughly $10 billion valuation with private investors before selling it off to Tencent for the direct listing. Kind of weird when you’re competitor owns a piece of your company after going public.

      Spotify is a tricky business to evaluate. There aren't any fair comparables (I've seen research analysts use Netflix and Amazon for multiples) to accurately value it. So, what is a fair value for a company that can generate massive revenues, has a superior product, but can't make a profit? I'm a firm believer that investors eventually lose patience with a company that doesn't improve bottom-line margins. Does it take five years? Ten? After going public in mid-2018, Spotify traded range-bound between $105-200 per share and appeared to be fairly valued until April 2020 when it began to take off. In my opinion, this more than 100% increase to $350 per share was not justified given the company's inability to improve profit margins while management gave no indication that things were drastically changing. Some will argue that higher sales and improving MAU's played a role but that was already factored into the share price prior to the run-up. Even though Spotify's share price is down 28% from its February high, there is still room to fall. Don't catch a falling knife as this name heads back to the low-$100's where it belongs."

      Don't Sleep on Spotify's Debt. Although Spotify currently generates a healthy operating cash flow, it's important to recognize the $1.8 billion in debt on its balance sheet. In early 2021, Spotify raised $1.3 billion in unsecured notes. For what exactly? Many are speculating on the uses. An acquisition? General corporate purposes? Paying out more to artists? That remains to be said, but regardless this adds a new risk factor to Spotify if it cannot execute on a plan to pay off these notes due in 2026. The company does have a history of getting out of a high debt situation. Prior to going public in 2018, Spotify had raised approximately $1 billion of convertible debt at a roughly $10 billion valuation with private investors before selling it off to Tencent for the direct listing. Kind of weird when you’re competitor owns a piece of your company after going public.

      Spotify is a tricky business to evaluate. There aren't any fair comparables (I've seen research analysts use Netflix and Amazon for multiples) to accurately value it. So, what is a fair value for a company that can generate massive revenues, has a superior product, but can't make a profit? I'm a firm believer that investors eventually lose patience with a company that doesn't improve bottom-line margins. Does it take five years? Ten? After going public in mid-2018, Spotify traded range-bound between $105-200 per share and appeared to be fairly valued until April 2020 when it began to take off. In my opinion, this more than 100% increase to $350 per share was not justified given the company's inability to improve profit margins while management gave no indication that things were drastically changing. Some will argue that higher sales and improving MAU's played a role but that was already factored into the share price prior to the run-up. Even though Spotify's share price is down 28% from its February high, there is still room to fall. Don't catch a falling knife as this name heads back to the low-$100's where it belongs."
stocks,"Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning July 12th, 2021 Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning July 12th, 2021.

# **Earnings season begins in the week ahead with eye-popping growth set to validate market’s 2021 run - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/09/earnings-season-begins-in-the-week-ahead-with-eye-popping-growth-set-to-validate-markets-2021-run.html)**
*****
&gt; Second-quarter earnings reporting season gets underway in the week ahead and eye-popping results could validate a market that continues to easily shake off any concerns on its steady march to record high after record high.
*****
&gt; The second quarter’s profits for S&amp;P 500 companies are expected to be up 65% from the same quarter a year ago in the depths of the pandemic, according to Refinitiv. The growth will be led by a near 570% increase in profits for industrials, one of the hardest hit sectors during the pandemic.
*****
&gt; “The second quarter could be as good as it gets for economic growth,” said Callie Bost, senior investment strategist at Ally Invest. “Earnings growth may slow, but analysts still expect S&amp;P profits to grow by double digits in the next two quarters. It’s crucial not to lose faith in the market just because the economy’s strongest growth may be behind us.”
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 climbed to yet another record on Friday following a minor setback on Thursday. Banks and other stocks linked to an economic comeback led the way. With Friday’s gain, the benchmark posted a 0.4% gain for the week and its sixth positive week in seven, bringing its 2021 gains to over 16%.
*****
&gt; The financial sector starts the earnings season off with reports from JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs Tuesday. Bank of America, Citigroup and Wells Fargo report Wednesday, and Morgan Stanley and Truist report Thursday.
*****
&gt; The banking industry is expected to produce blowout results for the second quarter with S&amp;P 500 financial sector earnings doubling year over year, according to Refinitiv. Major banks recently announced they will boost their dividend payouts after the Federal Reserve gave lenders a thumbs-up as all 23 passed the central bank’s stress test.
*****
&gt; Bank stocks led Thursday’s sell-off on Wall Street as some investors took bets off in the face of a surprising drop in Treasury yields. They then immediately snapped back Friday. Strong earnings result could help stabilize the sector that gyrated amid intensifying worries about slowing growth.
*****
&gt; # Big earnings numbers ahead
Among other sectors, consumer discretionary companies are also expected to see a big profit comeback, with earnings up 271%, according to Refinitiv. Energy companies are expected to see earnings bounce back by 225%, and materials are expected to see earnings growth of 115%. Tech lags those sectors with just a 31.6% gain. Utilities are expected to see earnings decline by 0.9%.
*****
&gt; “Once you pass the peak of economic growth as well as earnings growth, you do get higher levels of volatility,” said Matt Stucky, portfolio manager, equities, at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management Co. “We still think the path of least resistance is higher when it comes to equities but with more volatility than we’ve had.”
*****
&gt; He said he expects stocks to continue to make gains but to grow at a much more normal level. “There’s fundamental reasons to be optimistic about the market in the next year,” said Stucky. He said earnings should be strong and companies that can pass along higher costs will raise prices.
*****
&gt; # Inflation
There is also some important data ahead, particularly the Consumer Price Index on Tuesday. CPI inflation rose at a higher than expected annual rate of 5% in May, and June could also be hot. The Fed has said it would allow inflation to rise above its targeted 2% level, and watch an average inflation rate.
*****
&gt; “I think all of the inflation prints are going to take on added importance,” said Jim Caron, head of global macro strategy at Morgan Stanley Investment Management. “It’s not a question of whether it will fall. It’s whether it will fall fast enough to make the Fed remain patient. If it’s just lingering around a high level, that’s not good.”
*****
&gt; All eyes will be on the 10-year Treasury yield’s reaction to the data given the equity market took its cues from the bond market for most of the past week. As the 10-year yield dove to 1.25% on Thursday, the lowest since February, the equity market dropped, believing bond investors were signaling an economic global slowdown could be ahead. As yields snapped back on Friday, so did equity markets.
*****
&gt; Other data includes Producer Price Index Wednesday and retail sales for June on Friday.

&gt; # Stocks Are Going Streaking

&gt; To quote the great Frank the Tank from Old School, “We’re going streaking!” Although Frank had another idea, stocks have been streaking in some historic ways, both near-term and longer-term.

&gt; Let’s start with the more recent action. The S&amp;P 500 Index was recently higher seven consecutive days for the first time since last August, but even more impressive is it made new highs all seven of those days. You have to go back to June 1997 to find the last time we saw a streak like that! Incredibly, this has happened only eight other times since 1950 and stocks were higher a year later every single time.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/7.7.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Stocks have also streaked to monthly gains for five consecutive months. “Although a five month win streak for the S&amp;P 500 feels like a lot,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick, “a year later stocks were higher 25 out of 26 times after such long monthly win streaks. So the real strength could only be beginning.”

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, five month win streaks tend to be followed by strong performance over the next 12 months.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/7.7.21-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Lastly, the S&amp;P 500 has streaked to five consecutive quarterly gains. Some more color on this:

&gt; * The average return a year later has been only 6.6% because of very poor returns during the Great Financial Crisis. The median return a year later, though, is a solid 10.4%.

&gt; * The last time it was up five straight quarters was in the fourth quarter of 2016, when it went on to gain nine consecutive quarters.

&gt; * One year after that streak of five quarters stocks managed to gain more than 19% a year later.

&gt; * It has gained more than 5% for five consecutive quarters. Only from Q4 1953 through Q4 1954 did that last happen and stocks gained another 26% the following year.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/7.7.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; There is no doubt that stocks have put up some amazing streaks lately and history would suggest the path of least resistance remains higher. We listed some potential near-term worries in Three Things That Worry Us, but bigger picture going out a year or so, this bull market looks alive and well and these recent streaks do little to change that.

*****

&gt; # Mega Cap Stocks Relatively Strong

&gt; Mega cap stocks are an important area to watch and have been an area of our focus recently as the relatively small number of names hold a large weight within the S&amp;P 500. Their recent strength has propelled the broad market to a series of new highs in spite of what has been weaker breadth outside of this space.

&gt; In the chart below, we take a closer look at the relative performance of the four largest stocks versus the S&amp;P 500 over the past year. Alphabet (GOOGL) has performed the best versus the S&amp;P 500 of the four names shown and is at one-year highs. Apple (AAPL) outperformed the S&amp;P significantly in 2020 but gave it all back from late January through May. Since June, however, Apple has been on a tear versus the market. Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon (AMZN) are both still underperforming the S&amp;P over the last twelve months, but they have made solid moves higher since June.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/07/070721-Mega-Caps1.png))**

*****

&gt; # Value (VLUE) Giving Way To Quality (QUAL)

&gt; In last night's Closer, we noted how until February the Momentum factor (MTUM) was keeping up with Value (VLUE), but it has since given up ground as VLUE, even after stumbling of late, remains the clear top performer of the four factor-based ETFs from MSCI. On a total return basis, VLUE has gained 45.42% over the past year which is roughly 7 percentage points more than the next best performer: the Quality ETF (QUAL). Granted, that return was even stronger at 51.49% at the high on June 4th. With VLUE's outperformance having wavered over the past month, QUAL has been gaining ground. Additionally, although QUAL has underperformed, alongside Minimum Volatility (USVM) there has been a much less 'exciting' and steady grind higher than VLUE or Momentum (MTUM).

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/07/070721-Value-vs-Growth.png))**

&gt; # Diverging Breadth and Frothy Sentiment

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/a734b9d2b4777766bd113a28906be098/89796090ee48d63e-e2/s500x750/d6b685fd5371e36c3cb35b75d0907fd4f5a9f09a.jpg))**

&gt; Today’s selloff did not catch the Advance/Decline Line off guard. As you can see in the chart above, as the S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ logged minor new highs yesterday and DJIA did last Friday, market breadth has been diverging. NYSE Composite and S&amp;P 500 breadth have flat-lined over the past week while Russell 2000 and NASDAQ breadth turned clearly lower. This indicates a market running out of gas as advancing issues are unable to outpace decliners and in the case of the NAS and R2K decliners have been beating out advancers over the past week.

&gt; This bad breadth scenario comes at the outset of the seasonally weakest time of the year from mid-July through October – AKA the “Worst Four Months.” In addition, bullish sentiment had reached dangerous levels in the face of a dearth of bears. The chart below courtesy of the venerable Investors Intelligence U.S. Advisors Sentiment Report shows the difference of the Bullish Advisors % less the Bearish Advisors %. When this gets above 40 it’s a warning sign and with 60.8% Bulls and 15.5% bears the difference is now 45.3%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/713d20e83eb1f1b1223cebead8093162/89796090ee48d63e-f9/s500x750/44da67099273196331f448ae52d69bf3bd3f537d.jpg))**

&gt; The weekly CBOE Equity-Only Put/Call ratio tracked in Barron’s “Market Lab that we have followed for years, has also reached extremely complacent levels lately. Put/Call retreated from the modest fear level of 0.59 at the May lows back down to 0.41 the first two weeks of June and logging 0.43 and 0.44 the past two weeks. We have been getting defensive and in a neutral posture since our April 22 Best Six Months Seasonal MACD Sell Signal for S&amp;P 500 and DJIA and have been preparing for our MACD Sell Signal for NASDAQ’s Best 8 Months which appears imminent.

*****

&gt; # Value Has Given Up The Ghost

&gt; In the last few months of 2020 and throughout 2021, the S&amp;P 500 Value ETF (IVE) was consistently outperforming its growth counterpart (IVW). Since its most recent high in early June, though, IVE has given up the ghost falling 2.5%. Although not a dramatic decline, IVE's drop has coincided with a rally of 7.3% in IVW and an even larger 12.5% rally off the May 12th lows.

&gt; With growth having gained so much ground on value, on Tuesday, IVW's year-to-date performance actually moved above that of IVE. That has continued to be the case through the rest of the week as IVW is currently outperforming IVE on a year-to-date basis by almost a full percentage point. Additionally, looking at the past year's relative strength between the two ETFs, the recent divergence in performance has resulted in relative strength reverting back to zero meaning growth and value have roughly performed in line with one another over the one year span.

&gt; # Russell 2,000 (IWM) No Longer in Favor in Q2

&gt; The final quarter of 2020 and the first quarter of this year saw small caps come back into favor as the Russell 2,000 consistently outperformed the S&amp;P 500 during that stretch. From the late September test of its 200-DMA to the mid-March highs, the Russell 2,000 rose rallied around 65% versus the S&amp;P 500's gain which was less than half of that. As such, the ratio of the two indices shown below, and highlighted in last night's Closer, ripped higher. That outperformance has been absent over the past quarter though. In the second half of March, the ratio peaked then made a sharp reversal lower. Throughout Q2 and continuing into Q3, the ratio has continued to trend lower as the Russell 2,000 has trended sideways, hovering around its 50-DMA.

# DISCUSS!

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?

*****

I hope you all have a wonderful weekendand a great trading week ahead r/stocks!"
stocks,"How do you generate trade /investment ideas? Been watching a lot of Anton Kriels videos online, and clearly from their perspective idea generation is fundamental. That trading institute he set up, I swear it’s just set up to milk people for ideas, like loads of little tentacles all over the place.


Understanding the world and predicting tomorrow I guess sums it up, or even buy the rumour sell the news.

But how do you do that? you follow the news and keep track of world events but how do you predict the next thing?

I heard a few successful people saying how they just noticed something was popular and got into it early. One example I remember was this guy and he noticed that his daughter and all her friends were obsessed with Ugg boots so decided to invest in it.
Maybe Roblox was a similar thing for some people.

So how do you do it? I don’t want to join til tok but seems like a smart place to go :D"
stocks,"What’s a company that you’re confident is going to be around for the next 100 years? If you were to create an investment account for your future grandchildren today, what companies would you put in the portfolio, that you’re confident in that these companies are going to be around for along time?"
stocks,"What’s the intrinsic value behind investing in a company like, Domino’s Pizza, Inc, or Netflix etc? I don’t understand why DPZ, a pizza chain, even has a stock to begin with. 
It’s a, Pizza shop, looking at the stock price and stock history surprised me that a pizza stock, grew 1700% in 10 years. 

As for Netflix, what do they offer besides streaming services? Like it’s just Netflix.
And they have so much competition from other companies that offer more than. Just streaming services Im surprised Netflix has been so successful. 

What am I not seeing here?"
stocks,OGN- long term pick OGN My long term pick from now to end of 2022.    I’ve owned MRK forever and it’s never let me down.    I personally think their spinoff OGN will get up to $50-$55 in a year.    Prove me wrong please otherwise I’m going to continue to buy it every time it dips below $30!
stocks,"Is there an app where I can track my past trades and it shows me the P/L for the day on a month chart? I’ve seen posts like this a million times but never found out what the app/website is called. 

I basically want see at the end of the month to see what my weekly/monthly P/L was without having to do it through sheets or excel.

Thanks!"
stocks,"Some questions Hello, stock n00b here, have some questions.
1. Is s&amp;p 500 overvalued right now? Is it a good time to buy for long term? (Decades)
2. Where do I begin? As in, where do I begin with researching promising stocks? 

Thank you everyone."
stocks,Stock Tax Implications of Company Acquisition Today STMP announced that the company had reached a deal with a private investor to purchase the company and take it private. I purchased the stock a month ago. Is there any tax difference in selling now versus waiting for the deal to be complete? Thanks!

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Friday, July 9, 2021. Please enjoy! **PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, July 9, 2021**

The stock market pulled a remarkable turnaround today, shaking off yesterday’s declines with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) rocketing to another record intraday high, led by the financial and energy sectors, which had been lagging as of late and continued strength in mega-cap tech stocks. It seems that after a brief flare-up of concerns regarding the coronavirus delta variant and a potential acceleration of the timeline to taper quantitative easing in the US, fears have greatly tempered. At the time of writing, the Dow Jones (DIA) rose 1.27% while the Nasdaq (QQQ) rose 0.6% and is very slightly below it’s all-time high. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, led the day, rising more than 2%.

In recent weeks, market participants are increasingly trying to gauge if the surge we are seeing in the more contagious coronavirus delta variant will weigh on global growth rates. Yesterday, it seems concerns came to a head after the Japanese government made a last minute announcement that a state of emergency would be re-instituted across Tokyo and that all events would take place behind closed doors, with no spectators, walking back an earlier decision to allow locals to attend the games. The state of emergency will begin on Monday and run through Aug. 22, while the games are scheduled from July 23 to Aug. 8. On Wednesday, 16 days before the Opening Ceremony, the [Tokyo Metropolitan Government reported 920 COVID cases](https://stopcovid19.metro.tokyo.lg.jp/en), over 200 more than any other single-day total since May. On Thursday, it reported 896, the second-highest count since May. Other countries, like India and Brazil, are also dealing with an extremely worrying surge of cases. Even in the US, where roughly 50% of those eligible are fully vaccinated, the country is seeing a small surge in cases recently, with the delta variant accounting for 51.7% of all new infections, according to the CDC. According to reports, as of yesterday, only 16.8% of the Japanese population was vaccinated against the virus. 

In other news, in another move that raised concerns about the global growth rate, China’s central bank signalled it will be cutting the amount of cash that banks must hold in reserve, a move that suggests the economic recovery in China may be slowing down. The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) will reduce the reserve requirement ratio by 0.5 percentage points for most banks, according to a [statement](http://www.pbc.gov.cn/goutongjiaoliu/113456/113469/4287599/index.html) published Friday. That will unleash about 1 trillion yuan ($154 billion) of long-term liquidity into the economy and will be effective on July 15, the central bank said. The reduction was signaled earlier this week, when the State Council, China’s equivalent of a cabinet, hinted the central bank would make more liquidity available to banks so they could lend to smaller firms hurt by rising costs. The timing and magnitude of the move, coming a week before second-quarter growth data, suggests worries about the economy’s outlook and was a decisive shift away from policy tightening, which most, if not all, recovering economies are pursuing.

Ken Cheung, Chief Asian Foreign Exchange Strategist at Mizuho, said “The PBOC came in broader and sooner than expected, highlighting the policy urgency to support the Chinese economy. Such firm easing measures could further fuel concern over China’s growth outlook in the second half as well as the upcoming Q2 GDP figures in the coming week”. Just to put into more familiar terms, this would be like if the Federal Reserve suddenly turned around and said rather than discussing tapering quantitative easing, it would instead propose pumping more money into the economy.

While these global concerns did jitter the market yesterday, the impressive recovery in US equities underscores the remarkable strength of its economy, as the country continues reopening thanks to effective distribution of the vaccine, with 48% of the population fully vaccinated, according to the CDC. In my opinion, while the delta variant does pose a risk to global growth rates, and the market may react negatively to headlines about it, the foundations of the recovery in the US (i.e nation-wide reopening measures, a rapidly improving labor market, record earnings from companies, and a high level of savings among Americans) are very strong and will continue to underpin a bull market here. 

**Highlights** 

* The recent sell-off in crude oil recovered, with the West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures settling higher by 2.2% to $74.56 per barrel at the time of writing.
* Apple (AAPL), the largest company in the world, reached a new all-time high today. 
* President Biden is expected to sign an executive agreement ordering the Federal Trade Commission to limit or ban noncompete agreements, unnecessary occupational licenses, and revise guidance for sharing wage information between the HR department and workers and other employers. 
* Tesla (TSLA), Brookfield Asset Management (BAM) said Friday they would work together on a new initiative to create the nation's most sustainable residential community. The companies said the provisionally named SunHouse at Easton Park in Austin, Texas, would be the first Tesla Solar neighborhood.
* On Monday, a trial will kick off in the Court of Chancery in Wilmington, Delaware between Elon Musk and shareholders. The plaintiffs alleged that Musk used his control at Tesla to force the company to buy SolarCity for $2.6 billion in order to protect his investment in the company from bankruptcy and want Musk to pay that money back to Tesla. IMO seems a little weird to me to sue about this given that SolarCity has proven to be a good acquisition for Tesla.
* Apple (AAPL) is reportedly in early talks with the NFL to buy the rights to stream Sunday Night games for their streaming service. A while ago, Amazon (AMZN) bought the right to stream Thursday NFL games for Prime Video. 
* Marvel’s “Black Widow, opened in theaters last night and is expected to be the biggest opening since 2019, with the film projected to bring around $80 million domestically. This is huge and a sign that Americans' appetite to go to movie-theaters is very real. Personally, I’m going to go watch in the theaters this weekend. 
* Foxconn, a well known supplier for Apple, is discussing plans with Fisker (FSR) to open a factory to build EV’s in Wisconsin. In a statement, the company said, “Foxconn has engaged the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation (WEDC) to discuss the company's plans for electric vehicle manufacturing. Foxconn is optimistic about our partnership with WEDC and looks forward to ongoing discussions

I wanted to ask for some advice about stocks (not ETFs) due to macro signs of covid coming back to life with the Delta+ variant, Japan signaling there will be no audience in Olympics, US pinging masks won't be relieved and general little fear levels rising.

Also, generally speaking - would the better play be to just keep more cash, or is it smart to put some money in now for some covid-friendly stocks?

Thank you all in advance!

P.S. I do hope this does not happen, but we got to be prepared for anything and I want to raise a discussion."

I can’t call out any other company that is more popular amongst millennials and youth for finding events (that is publicly traded I mean).

stocks,"I went over the entire TSX and TSXV. Here's what I conclude Of these, about 80% have little or no revenue, and have massive accumulated deficits offset by large issues equity (The companies lose money YoY, and to stay afloat they sell more and more shares each year).  This really destroys shareholder value, and makes these companies toxic.  Most of these companies are mining, materials or exploration companies by category, but in reality they just own a plot of land they believe has some resource buried deep in it.  I read through the annual reports for about ten of these companies.  The reports are very simple, and it is clear that they have deep issues in operations and financials.

There are a number of SP\*C like companies that offer little promise.  They claim that they are a resource or manufacturing company - but looking deep into their operations the words ""planned manufacturing"" or ""future acquisitions"" are prevalent in any discussion about operations or assets.  These companies have nothing going on.  They may have some ideas or plans, some capital to carry out these plans, but they don't actually own or do anything.  There are hundreds of these companies.

There are a few promising small cap companies, and more promising mid to large cap companies.  I have tabulated 110 companies that have some promise or have good current operations.  These are all my opinion, and I haven't considered at all any of the financial states of these companies - I have only read a blurb about what the company does, and looked at the size and current earnings in some cases.  Some may have great operations, some may be horribly unprofitable, but all are distinguished as doing something other than thinking about mining or buying real estate.

stocks,"[UPDATE] Lets talk oil A week or so ago i posted [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/obi96c/lets_talk_oil/) thread talking about Oil futures leveraged at x2. 

it did not get much traction as I expected, but the small indications i did get made me look farther into the stock. 

quick tl;dr, I'm following the stock SG ETC WTI +2x Daily Leveraged Collateralized (OIL2L.MI) that had a 1 to 100 grouping over 2020 to correct the dip when oil went below 0. the future was emitted in 2017 and has a buy back clause with deadline 2047. 

The deadline of the contract for this Future is 2047 at whatever price per barrel leveraged by two is on the date of expiry. 

I was wondering, as I bought the stock previous to the grouping of the stock, if I were to hold until 2047 and bring the contract to its end of term, would the stock buy back have to be at 100 times the value I bought the contract for? Have I been robbed of 100 times the profit I should make if this is not the case? 

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for any advice anyone has to offer, 

have a nice day."
stocks,"ESG investing is NOT bullshit, here's why There is another thread going right now about how outrageous it is for certain brands to be included in certain ESG funds. It seems like the majority of folks are saying, 'Yeah, ESG is bullshit corporate PR and fuck it all.'

When it comes to individual corporations self-reporting on their 'ESG metrics', yes, they obviously are going to make themselves seem like god's gift to the human race, while they continue to destroy the planet. And in that regard certain aspects of ESG reporting can be a load of crap.

But that *does not* diminish the power of true ESG mutual funds and of ESG investing in general.

Just like when you are choosing any stock or ETF, you *must* research what they hold, why, the hold it and who they (the funds) are.

I've been investing the socially responsible mutual funds/ETFs since 2012 - when those funds were just in a text list on some 90's-era website. Even then, you look up the fund, you look at their holdings, you read their statement, and you figure out if their approach fits with what you believe in.

At that time ESG had a sort of Protestant bent to it - most the funds were 'no guns, tobacco, gambling, or alcohol'. Well, I honestly don't care about any of that shit. I'm in it for the planet, so I found two funds that I liked:

Green Century and Walden.

https://www.greencentury.com/

https://www.bostontrustwalden.com/investment-services/mutual-funds/

And here's what I liked about them: they don't just invest in companies that are already green, they use their capital to push companies to become *more green*. Every quarter you get a little pamphlet in the mail talking about specific things that they have encouraged companies to do.

Example: https://www.greencentury.com/protecting-the-bees-that-play-a-vital-role-as-pollinators/

*That* is how an ESG fund can be incredibly effective.

And so while *some* ESG funds may not align with your values, ESG is not a catchall. It simply means

Environment - impact on climate

Social - how do their treat their workers, community

Governance - what does their power structure look like

One time I thought 'Oh, I'll invest in this ETF that only holds female-run corporations', well, it's a nice thought, but then I realized I was holding a bunch of shitty chemical companies that I despise. So, that investment concept didn't work for me. Many ESG ETFs might have criteria that don't align with what is important to you, but you've got to do the research before you give up on fighting for change with your money.

So anyways, I encourage people *not* to just shit on ESGs, but to work to utilize the power of funds to push corporations to act more responsibly. It is hugely powerful for massive numbers of people to amass massive quantities of money and leverage that money for good.

So for anyone still curious where they can screen for ESGs that they might actually *like* rather than just be disenfranchised by, maybe take a look at the this website, which breaks funds down by their focus - and go from there:

https://charts.ussif.org/mfpc/

And I'll say it before anyone else does - the actively managed funds' expense ratios are generally higher than your computer-managed index ETFs, but in my opinion it's money well spent. These people are trying to save the planet from inside the system and they can take a cut of the money they make me in the process."
stocks,"Is it short term or long term capital gains taxes Hey guys, so i’ve been working for a company for a few years and when they hire me they gave me stock options. The company wasnt public but that is their goal. Now there is talk of it going public (no actual dates or anything yet) and i was thinking of selling what i have to help me pay for some debt thats crippling me. If i were to sell, would it count as a short term capital gain and be taxed at my current tax bracket or would it be seen as a long term option and be taxed less since ive had those stock options for years."

stocks,"Looking to Match VTI With Another ETF Hey all,

I'm a relatively young investor with a high risk tolerance. I'm planning on parking my cash into VTI, but want to pair it with another ETF more focused on growth (and take on a bit more risk in the process). VOOG comes to mind but the expense ratio is a bit higher (as they tend to be). Any other recommendations?"
stocks,"State of the stock market Really good actually. We saw a healthy pullback in the Dow Jones, S&amp;P 500 and the NASDAQ. Either we will keep the momentum in the future upcoming months or we see multiple bigger crashes due to all the negative news. But it seems that all short term traders are fairly happy with this pullback because we saw a healthy yet not overly valued recovery on the day."
stocks,"Understanding the Tape I’m sure this has been asked quite a bit but does anyone have a good way of reading the tape? I have been using TOS with real-time using their level 2s and T&amp;S. I just recently got DAS trader pro and can honestly say I feel like I’m seeing more in depth. However, I have been focusing on interpreting one stock’s tape (AAPL).  I see a lot of manipulation on the price action trying to always shake retails out and I guess my question is how can I identify a clear direction. I feel like for me atm I am placing high probability trades at my “buy levels” (which I have seen are also shakeout levels) which follow with a huge rip up. I am also primitively using tape speed, buying on the ask, increasing price as confirmations. Any help or direction would be appreciated. 

Long story short: what’s the best way to identify direction and confirmation using time and sales / level 2."

stocks,"Top 5 Chinese Stocks to Buy Now On A Discount Chinese stocks have been getting more heat recently and have dropped further, but they've maintained their technical levels of support which means that we have yet another buying opportunity. These are not short-term plays, but are very attractive IMO.

These are my top 5 Chinese stocks to buy right now. All five are cheap, have a good growth outlook and have 40%+ upside.

1. $BABA - leader in Chinese ecommerce (its Taobao and Tmall account for 58% of the $1.8 Trillion Chinese ecommerce market) and the biggest cloud solutions provider in China
2. $BIDU - the most used search engine in China - 80% of all searches and 93% of all mobile searches! Also has cloud, AI and driverless cars business plus a number of other smaller initiatives. For example, Baidu's AI speaker is the most purchased one on the Chinese market
3. $DOYU and HUYA (HUYA is not on eToro) - the two companies account for 80% of the Chinese streaming market which is expected to grow 32% next year! Both are extremely cheap, especially DOYU
4. $QFIN - rapidly growing consumer lending business which was NOT affected by last year's Chinese financial regulations unlike virtually all of its competitors! It dropped 25% yesterday after its core product, the 360 IOU app, was delisted from app stores in China due to data safety regulations, but I think that the company can deal with this quickly and come back on top. It was trading for $44 a few weeks ago so it could skyrocket again although we may have to wait until its next earnings report in \~45 days or so

$KC is an honourable mention - the company is China's largest independent cloud solutions provider (much tinier than Alibaba, but it's growing fast) and it's also been on a downward trend for a while, but has a lot of potential. It's one to watch although I don't know if you should be buying it right now.

What do you think about investing in China? I know a lot of people are polarised - they are either excited about it or strongly opposed. It is definitely risky, but I think that the macroenvironment for China is looking good over the next few years."

stocks,"I predict Amazon will acquire Lyft within the next 18 months Lyft is five times cheaper to acquire than Uber. It has 35% of ridesharing marketshare in America and is rapidly growing in Canada—two of Amazon's biggest market. 



Currently, no major Western ridesharing platform is profitable. That's because it takes a ton of costly promotions and subsidies on both the rider and driver sides to grow a ridesharing platform. 



Amazon, however, could substantially reduce the high cost of new rider acquisition by just offering their over 100 million Prime members a discount for using Lyft over Uber. This would shift marketshare overnight. 



Then, on the driver side, Lyft drivers could be doing last mile order fulfillment for Prime Now and Amazon Restaurant when ride demand is low—effectively increasing driver wages through removing time spent waiting for a new passenger while also lowering Amazon's fulfillment costs. 



The operational efficiencies that come from owning both commerce and ridesharing would allow Amazon to become the most valuable company in the world.



Uber and Amazon are already competing on a ton of fronts. AmazonFresh and UberEats, Uber freight and amazon prime delivery. My money is on Bezos to win though, they can shoulder the massive costs with AWS"

stocks,"Online payments firm Stripe takes first step toward listing Digital payments processor Stripe Inc, the most valuable U.S. technology startup, has taken its first major step toward a stock market debut by hiring a law firm to help with preparations, according to people familiar with the matter.

The 11-year-old company, which was valued by investors at $95 billion in a fundraising round in March, has sat out this year's red-hot market for initial public offerings (IPOs), using private tender offers to allow some of its existing investors and employees to cash out their holdings.

Remaining private has enabled Stripe to keep such financial details as revenue and profitability under wraps. Yet this has also deprived it of using its shares as a publicly traded currency to help finance acquisitions and to incentivize employees.

Stripe has tapped Cleary Gottlieb Steen &amp; Hamilton LLP as a legal adviser on its early-stage listing preparations, the sources said. There has been no decision on the timing of the stock market debut, and the next step would be the hiring of investment banks later this year, the sources added. The listing would be unlikely to happen this year, two of the sources said.

Stripe is considering going public through a direct listing, rather than a traditional IPO, because it does not need to raise money, said two of the sources, cautioning that those plans could change.

 Founded in 2010 by Irish brothers Patrick and John Collison, Stripe processes hundreds of billions of dollars in transactions every year for millions of businesses worldwide. Its list of clients includes Alphabet Inc's Google, Uber Technologies Inc, Amazon.com Inc and Zoom Video Communications Inc. Early investors Elon Musk, Peter Thiel and Google’s venture capital arm.

Stripe's breakneck growth could result in it challenging Chinese technology giants Ant Group and ByteDance, whose valuations are close to $200 billion, for the title of world's most valuable startup by the time it goes public.

stocks,"Effects on stock price of a company listed in multiple countries if exchange rate changes For the purpose of this example, let’s assume company XYZ is listed in Canada (e.g., TSE) and the US (e.g., NYSE). Let further assume that USD.CAD = 1.25. Consequently, if the stock price in the US is $100 per share, it should be $125 CAD in Canada, otherwise there would be an arbitrage opportunity. Now let’s say the US dollars weakens and the exchange rate goes to par. Under the assumption that the fundamental data of the company hasn’t changed, what should the new price be: 100 USD = 100 CAD? Or 125 USD = 125 CAD?  Or something in between?"

stocks,"FWIW - an explanation to ""Why is my stock down""  I've seen a few comments around recently like ""earnings were great, why did the stock tank"", ""omg what happened, someone please explain why \_\_\_\_ just skyrocketed on no news"".

I could say ""well, it was baked in / overvalued in the first place and results were still below the higher expectations"" or ""there's some game changing development that's not public yet"", but regardless of whether those statements are right or wrong - the explanation / ""valuation"" sometimes...might not matter.

The stock market is just a giant game of chicken between bulls and bears. Revenue, earnings, news, etc. can just be seen as helpful hints (and I do believe material changes in a business should matter), but ultimately a stock's price comes down to which side has more conviction/money behind it. I think the developments with meme stocks and PND's have made this more apparent.

When a stock goes down, more money simply decided to sell/short it and vice versa (maybe it's moving in sympathy with the broader market or it's industry). Instead of thinking revenue/earnings/news drives the stock price, just think of the information as tools players can use in order to convince more people to buy/sell a stock.

I guess what I'm saying is...everything is manipulation. Try not to panic, learn to use it to your advantage. If I have conviction in my long and short plays (and if nothing material changes my thesis - always good to adapt if it does), the easy thing to do is just hold / buy the dips / roll. Sometimes I'll hedge, sometimes I'll trade the momentum / sentiment. Just my 2 cents, but hoping this can help some newer investors get their bearings."

stocks,"Is the movie industry really dieing? And is $AMC's Fundamental value really $5? DD on both. First post here.  I've been on Reddit since Feb. 1st though when I bought shares of $AMC. Yes my profile says only 7 days old but that's because I had to make my handle anonymous for work purposes.  Anyways, I finally decided to do some fundamental DD the movie industry and subsequently $AMC.  What inspired me to do this was to research that ""myths"" that the movie industry is dieing and that $AMC's fundamental value is $5.  I decided not to take it at face value anymore and do the research. You won't believe what I uncovered.  First, the myth we hear that people aren't attending movies anymore is simply not true. Box Office Revenue for North America, revenue has increased from 2008 at 9 Billion to 11 Billion in 2019.
https://www.statista.com/statistics/187069/north-american-box-office-gross-revenue-since-1980/
 I can hear the haters and Bears now, but movie theaters make their money on concessions not tickets!  This is not true and another myth. While it's true theatres make more off of concessions, 85%, they still make money off tickets, 40%.
https://www.google.com/search?q=do+movie+theaters+make+money+from+ticket+sales&amp;oq=do+mov&amp;aqs=chrome.1.69i57j35i39j0l2j69i60.5927j0j7&amp;client=ms-android-mpcs-us-revc&amp;sourceid=chrome-mobile&amp;ie=UTF-8
In the US alone concessions accounted for an additional 5.7 Billion in Revenue.
https://www.google.com/search?q=how+much+revenue+did+movie+theaters+make+in+north+america&amp;oq=how+much+r&amp;aqs=chrome.1.69i57j35i39l2j0j0i131i433.4972j0j7&amp;client=ms-android-mpcs-us-revc&amp;sourceid=chrome-mobile&amp;ie=UTF-8
That means the movie industry is North America alone is worth approximately 17 Billion. It's not going anywhere. Additionally, let's not forget, giants like $AMC are worldwide, as those in Europe will attest to, so this revenue figure is actually larger.  Why didn't I include it? Because it's more work and I'm not getting paid.
So now that we know that the movie industry is a viable business, let's talk about $AMC.  $AMC is the leader in North America with 8043 screens, The only companies close to $AMC are Regal and possibly Cinemark. 
https://www.statista.com/statistics/188565/north-american-movie-theater-circuits-by-number-of-screens/
After that it's quite a drop, $AMC could purchase some of these smaller chains, as they have financially struggled as well due to the pandemic, and are debt ridden too, but unlike $AMC that had Apes to bail it out, these smaller chain remain in precarious financial situations. A potential opportunity for AMC to increase its market share. Indeed, CEO Adam Aron has already done this with the purchase of Fitchburg.  
https://www.google.com/amp/s/madison.com/ct/writers/rob-thomas/amc-buys-back-fitchburg-movie-theater-plans-to-reopen-in-june/article_235f52b1-93b4-5858-9978-8b5ebc8b9e9d.amp.html
But you need revenue to aquire new theatres, how does that look for $AMC?  I was surprised to discover in doing the DD that $AMC had an all time revenue high for the US at 5.7 Billion in 2019.  This is why it's good to do the DD.  Furthermore, AMC hit an ATH in 2018 with with 359 million attendees Worldwide.  2019 showed it was no fluke with 356 million attendees Worldwide. 
""Total attendance at AMC Theatres worldwide reached record levels in 2018, with over 359 million attendees, though this figure dropped to 356 million in 2019. The company also announced all-time high revenue of over 5.47 billion U.S. dollars for the latter year.""
https://www.statista.com/statistics/188565/north-american-movie-theater-circuits-by-number-of-screens/
Thus the future is promising once we are thoroughly out of the pandemic.  So what about now?  Well shockingly somehow the Box Office Revenue is down  37% from last year. Likely because the Country opened up for a part of 2020 before shutting back down again in 2021.
https://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/364822/movie-business-expects-us-box-office-recovery.html
What does that mean? Well with everything open now I believe the movie industry is in for a lucrative July and August.  Black Widow opening this weekend will be a good barometer to see if the movie industry has fully recovered and if it can makeup the gap from last year.  Earnings report for $AMC is due August 3rd. Now could be the time to get in if you think the Earnings report will be positive and serve as a catalyst to drive the price up."

""All of a sudden I was going 30 in the middle of the highway,"" she said.

The touchscreen system, which is critical because it operates most of the Tesla's controls, stopped working not long after the car arrived for testing, the review said. Car and Driver also noted poor fits between parts and a ""grating squeak"" from the rear seat.

The Model 3 had a large gap around the hood, Car and Driver noted. Another Tesla they tested, [the Model S](https://www.cnn.com/2021/06/21/success/tesla-model-s-plaid-motortrend/index.html), only had 3,600 miles on it but its front motor failed. It was repaired and the car continued the tests, but the incident ended its chance of winning the award, Car and Driver said.

Tesla, which generally does not respond to media inquiries, has not answered CNN Business's request for comment on the Car and Driver report."
stocks,"Compound interest on stocks I just want to clarify how compound interest works, if I have 10,000 worth of stock at $10 a share and it had a 400% gain to 40 would I have $160,000? Or just $50,000. I know how compound interest works but I just feel like I’m getting something wrong in stocks, haven’t had a 100% gain yet and I’m having trouble believing that’s actually right, thanks for the comments and sorry for such a noob Question lol"
stocks,Buying stocks at all time highs I started investing this year.

Im new to investing in stocks and Looking at a stock that has a earnings per share of 1.55 and a P/E of 20.70.

It's looking like this rumor is starting to gain traction. The 20B deal is clarified here by Reuters' sources as being in the form of a $90-100 per share buyout, representing a 50% premium over the current price.

13-day upward trend is pretty strong with some crazy pre-market action a few days back, and relative volume has been strong. It's possible we're seeing a ramp up here - whether it'll hit 90$ or go above before settling will be something to see. What I've seen building up to buyouts that I've seen is just the same as this, a ramp up coming to a breakout to the proposed deal price, then it plateaus. Obviously, the trend may be different here and I'm curious about your guys' experience with these events. 

I think if it does see momentum continuing to build, it could be a very good call opportunity as well.

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Thursday, July 8, 2021 **PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, July 8, 2021**

Stocks dipped across the board today, putting a stop to the recent record-setting rally that has seen both the Nasdaq (QQQ) and S&amp;P 500 (SPY) reach countless fresh intraday highs in the last six weeks or so. The SPY and Dow Jones (DIA) both fell roughly 0.9% while the tech-heavy QQQ fared slightly better, closing 0.65% down. It seems there a few differing factors that contributed to the drop today, including but not limited to, (1) rising coronavirus fears outside of the US due to the highly contagious Delta variant, (2) the Fed’s June Meeting Minutes, which showed members are increasingly talking about accelerating the timeline to taper quantitative easing, (3) a disappointing weekly unemployment report, and (4) general profit-taking after such a monster rally in the market. In positive news, the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield sank for the fourth straight day, hovering around a multi-month low at 1.29%, a sign that inflation fears are further tapering. 

In a sign of rising concerns over the highly contagious coronavirus delta variant, the Japanese made a last minute announcement that a state of emergency would be re-instituted across Tokyo and that all events would take place behind closed doors, with no spectators, walking back an earlier decision to allow locals to attend the games. On Wednesday, 16 days before the Opening Ceremony, the [Tokyo Metropolitan Government reported 920 COVID cases](https://stopcovid19.metro.tokyo.lg.jp/en), over 200 more than any other single-day total since May. On Thursday, it reported 896, the second-highest count since May. Other countries, like India and Brazil, are also dealing with an extremely worrying surge of cases. Even in the US, where roughly 50% of those eligible are fully vaccinated, the country is seeing a small surge in cases recently, with the delta variant accounting for 51.7% of all new infections. 

Yesterday, the Federal Reserve released the June Meeting minutes, which are notes about what was discussed in the latest meeting, which helps market participants decipher that path forward for monetary policy and possible timelines for any adjustments. The Fed said the economic recovery “was generally seen as not having yet been met”, but said they are ready to act if inflationary pressures indeed begin to materialize. The minutes said, “Participants generally judged that, as a matter of prudent planning, it was important to be well positioned to reduce the pace of asset purchases, if appropriate, in response to unexpected economic developments, including faster-than anticipated progress toward the Committee’s goals or the emergence of risks that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals”. This is not surprising, as I have been saying for weeks now, as the pace of economic recovery improves, quantitative easing, or the purchase of government bonds in order to inject money into the economy, is always the first policy to be tapered. I am not worried about the tapering of quantitative easing and encourage everyone to read up about the 2013 Taper Tantrum, which happened when the Fed announced QE would be tapered since the economy had largely recovered from the 2008 crisis by then.

In other news, after a strong run of outperformance in reports about the labor market, the most recent weekly unemployment report showed new jobless claims unexpectedly tick higher. According to the Department of Labor, there were 373,000 new jobless claims filed last week, higher than the 350,000 expected. While it is slightly disappointing, jobless claims in the US have been continuously declining for months, a sign that the labor market continues to improve as the US continues to reopen.

Ian Shepherdson, Chief Economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics said, “The consensus ignored the tendency for unadjusted claims to rise in weeks when July 4 falls on a Sunday, so the risk was always to the upside. But this is noise, not signal. The seasonal adjustments are struggling simultaneously with the July 4 holiday period and the annual automakers’ retooling shutdowns, which can make the headline numbers even more volatile than usual. The noise will persist through late July, but we have no doubt that the underlying trend will remain downwards."" I agree and remain encouraged by the pace of recovery in the labor market. 

Another potential explanation for today’s pullback, coupled with the other reasons listed, may be general profit taking after such a monster run by the broader market. Since mid-May, the Nasdaq and SPY are up 12.3% and 6% respectively, a great run by any judgement. Nothing ever goes straight up, sometimes dips are needed for the market to recharge for another move higher. 

Looking ahead, market participants are waiting for Q2 earnings season, which is set to kick off next week with big banks reporting. 

**Highlights**

* The Labor Department's monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Summary showed U.S. job openings increased to 9.209 million in May. This followed a downwardly revised 9.193 million in April, which was brought down from the 9.286 million previously reported
* U.S. mortgage applications declined for a second straight week last week, declining to the lowest level in a year-and-a-half as home price growth and low housing inventories weighed further on purchasing activity.

stocks,"Current State of the Plastics Industry: A Short Term Analysis of Resin Manufacturers LyondellBasell and Danimer Scientific   
Disclaimer: I am currently involved in pitches and investments related to these securities, along with having personal interest in the future of both. Much of what is stated is extrapolated from my knowledge as an engineering student, but for most I try to include sources as much as I can.  


\#\*\*LET US BEGIN\*\*

In the wake of the Texas power outages due to the inadequacy of ERCOT to efficiently maintain power during severe weather conditions, the state of the resin manufacturing industry has been thrown into disarray. A large quantity of domestic resin production in the United States is centered around the gulf coast, fueled by the oil fields in the Midwestern South. This decrease in production has resulted in turmoil within the resin-based stock market, as many tickers hit by the industrial decline which coincided with the latter half of these outages have struggled greatly. Between June 8th and the date of this writing (June 25th), LyondellBasell (NYSE: LYB) fell 10.00%, and Danimer Scientific Inc. (NYSE: DNMR) fell 13.83%. In this, I detail an analysis on both stocks, along with my thoughts on what the recovery of the resin industry will look like.  


\##**LyondellBasell Industries N.V., the Case for a Strong Resin Resurgence**

*LyondellBasell Industries* (NYSE: LYB) is, as of 2018, the [third largest independent chemical manufacturer in the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_chemical_producers), with a particular focus on polyethylene production. Formed in 2007 through the purchase and subsequent merging of the Lyondell Chemical Company into Basell Polyolefins. [They are the worlds largest licensor of polyolefin technology](https://www.lyondellbasell.com/en/products-technology/technology/), and have the majority of their plastic resin producing facilities in the United States based in Texas, with the largest being located in Channelview, TX, just outside of Houston.

  
 [Polyethylene is the worlds most produced type of plastic](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/The-six-most-common-plastic-polymers-produced-worldwide-in-2012-Plastic-Europe-2013_tbl1_273089847), coming in Low-Density (LDPE), Linear Low-Density (LLDPE), and high-density (HDPE) variations. It is also the most used type of plastic in [packaging, a plastics industry consumes up to 40% of the plastic production worldwide.](https://www.mdpi.com/2313-4321/3/1/1/htm)

Polyethylene, especially low-density polyethylene, is perfect for many packaging uses. It is a lightweight, clear, destructible material that is food safe, nonreactive with most chemical compounds, and has a melt temperature just above 105 Celsius. [With the proper additives, LDPE can also be made static resistant.](https://brentwoodplastics.com/anti-static#:~:text=There%20are%20four%20basic%20classes%20of%20anti%2Dstats%20for%20LDPE%20film%3A&amp;text=GMS%2C%20or%20glycerol%20mono%2Dstearate,and%20usefulness%20in%20dry%20environments.) This makes it ideal for wrapping electronic products and components that are sensitive to static electricity.

As COVID-19’s effect on the economy wanes, there has been a significant increase in consumer spending. [According to the United States Bureau of Economic Analysis, consumer spending has nearly reached pre-lockdown levels.](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/consumer-spending)

&amp;#x200B;

With the influx of stimulus money into the public, the spending of consumers has seen a dramatic recovery. This significant increase of products being sold requires a large amount of plastic to package, plastic that is created using resin that LyondellBasell manufactures and licenses. A difficulty to create resin does not necessarily coincide with a drop in profitability. Instead, a discrepancy has been created. A high demand for LDPE fueled by consumer spending, along with a low supply caused by production hampering along the Gulf Coast is unlikely to result in a devaluation of the material, but instead a significant increase in the price of the resin per pound. **LyondellBasell is perfectly poised to take advantage of this and profit significantly during the second quarter, as a scarcity in resin allows them to charge premium prices without having to worry about risking their customers**. The control that resin manufacturers now have over the market assures the health of said manufacturers. LDPE is not just a commodity; it is a necessity. Therefore, the demand of LDPE is assured, and the pricing will simply move to reflect the lucrative industry packaging plastics has become in recent months.   


\##**Danimer Scientific Incorporated, the Case Against a New Contender**

*Danimer Scientific Incorporated* (NYSE: DNMR) is a corporation centered around the production and manufacturing of bioplastics and biodegradable polymers. Founded in 2004 and debuting on the NYSE in December of 2020. Their flagship product, Nodax, is a polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) with a claimed biodegradation time of as little as two months. Produced on a 1:1 ratio through the fermentation of canola oil with relevant microorganisms, Nodax seems to be poised to take over the plastics market. Nodax is a plastic with thermal properties that can stretch between Low-density and High-density Polyethylene, as well as having a tensile strength located right between the two. Through its mechanical properties and its range of uses, Nodax could have the potential to replace the wasteful packaging industry with a material that can biodegrade without harming the environment, and without sacrificing the properties that make petroleum-based polymers attractive for such uses. That being said, the company still has a long way to go before it can successfully produce a relevant amount of Nodax to fulfill the market demand for an acceptable environmentally friendly replacement to petroleum-based polymers. Danimer still has a long way to go before it could possibly benefit from a wounded resin industry, including issues with properly handling this new waste and also supplying for its production.

The first bit of skepticism comes from their claims of the biodegradability of their plastic. [The claim that Nodax is capable of completely degrading within two months is based on perfect conditions](https://www.wsj.com/articles/plastic-straws-that-quickly-biodegrade-in-the-ocean-not-quite-scientists-say-11616238001#:~:text=Created%20with%20sketchtool.,-Plastic%3A%20The%20Scourge&amp;text=At%20some%20ocean%20temperatures%2C%20Nodax,bottles%20could%20take%20even%20longer.), which is not realistic. Their conditions require microorganisms producing polymerase which can break down Nodax, and these microorganisms are not ubiquitous at all corners of our lives. [In 60% of cases, plastic waste ends up in landfills instead of being recycled](https://www.unep.org/interactive/beat-plastic-pollution/). The assumption that landfills will possess the correct microorganisms to degrade these plastics is questionable, as [many landfills are specifically designed to limit the decomposition of inner components.](https://highcountryconservation.org/2019/07/16/ask-eartha-why-we-dont-want-our-trash-to-break-down-in-the-landfill/) While this is great overall, as it reduces methane gases being released into our atmosphere, this is devastating for the proposition of a biodegradable plastic. While one could always assume that we should just make sure that these bioplastics reach their end of life in controlled environments, the world’s previously mentioned issue with ensuring plastics are recycled calls into question the viability of trying to create foolproof systems to make sure that Nodax end up where it should.

  
 In addition, the production of Nodax requires an extreme amount of growth in canola related agriculture. Nodax is produced using canola/rapeseed oil at about a 1:1 ratio. [In 2015, the world consumed around 380 million tons of plastics per annum.](https://ourworldindata.org/plastic-pollution#how-much-plastic-does-the-world-produce) 

Of that, around [40% or 152 million tons are used in packaging.](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/plastics-facts-infographics-ocean-pollution#:~:text=CALIFORNIA%2C%20SANTA%20BARBARA-,40%20percent%20of%20plastic%20produced%20is%20packaging,just%20once%20and%20then%20discarded.) The majority of these packaging plastics are made of ethylene based polymers or polypropylene, both of which are mostly petroleum-based. [Current canola/rapeseed production worldwide comes out to about 27.3 million tons per year.](https://www.statista.com/statistics/263930/worldwide-production-of-rapeseed-by-country/) In addition to this, the [average production of canola/rapeseed oil per acre is 1,840 pounds](https://www.agmrc.org/commodities-products/grains-oilseeds/rapeseed#:~:text=its%20production%20properties.-,Production,pounds%20per%20acre%20in%202016.), or .831 metric tons. Therefore, to replace traditional packaging polymers, canola/rapeseed agricultural output would have to increase 5.56 times over to meet the demand. With such a large increase of agricultural expansion, this could have severe impacts on the environment. With current acreage on canola/rapeseed production, we would need 183 million acres of land to use for new farmland. [For reference the entire state of Texas in the United States is 171 million acres.](https://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/fsm8_037652.htm) An amount of farmland larger than the size of Texas would be required to replace packaging needs worldwide. The agricultural production needed just does not exist right now. Even with the current production of canola/rapeseed, this plastic could only take up 2% of the current market share for plastic resin production worldwide, assuming that they can use every drop of canola oil produced. 

Will Danimer succeed in the short term? In all likelihood, yes. The criticism of this company and their product has so far ignored the potential for extreme profits even with the limited amount they can produce. The potential for custom made packaging, as pointed out by a peer of mine, cannot be understated. [Their deals with companies like Nestle](https://www.nestle.com/media/pressreleases/allpressreleases/nestle-danimer-scientific-develop-biodegradable-water-bottle) show that huge businesses are still interested in it. What Danimer and Nodax are not, however, is a silver bullet to the packaging needs of the United States or of the world. **It is unlikely that the resurgence of the resin market, then, will affect Danimer’s revenue**. What is more likely is that speculation on the future of Nodax and its use in plastics will drive spikes in market value, and this will be followed by a period of slow and consistent growth as either the supply of the necessary materials and/or Danimer’s list of partners expands. **Danimer’s growth will be its own, and it will be as the above-mentioned problems, especially in the raw material supply needs, are resolved.**  


\#\*\*TL;DR: The resin industry will be doing great, but now is not the time to expect new contenders to make huge gains and huge amounts of customers. An investment in both will likely be profitable, but you will have to wait a while for significant gains from DNMR.\*\*"

stocks,"Excited about Burgers? Try this one ($BFI) I've been looking into this company for a while and I think there's a lot of potential. BurgerFi is a fast casual burger company founded in 2011 and went public in December 2020. They are mainly in Florida but expanding rapidly on the east coast. Here are some reasons why I think they're undervalued and could see 6x just from the share price alone:

They're expanding with 25 new restaurants opening in the near future. https://www.foodtruckoperator.com/news/burgerfi-ramps-up-growth-via-3-channels/

Martha Stewart was recently added to their board of directors. https://www.qsrmagazine.com/news/burgerfi-adds-martha-stewart-board-directors

Gaining more public visibility and receiving awards. Recently was named Fast Casual's 2021 Brand of the Year. https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/burgerfi-named-fastcasuals-top-brand-of-2021-301295482.html#:~:text=BurgerFi%20was%20voted%20the%20Top,Best%20Burger%20Joint%22%20by%20Consumer

With a low market cap, expansion plans during COVID recovery, and currently sitting near ATLs, I think this is a great play. Shake Shack has a cap of ~4.4B, while BurgerFi is at ~160M. With their expansion plans I think this has a potential to get to 1B market cap in a year or two, which would be PT of ~60 from its current price of 10. What do you guys think?"
stocks,"Calling SoFi bulls, can you tell me why SoFi isn't just a regular bank dressed up for millennials? Been reading SoFi DD's on here and WSB and, unless i'm missing something, SoFi just seems like a run-of-the-mill bank targeted for people 20-35. I personally use SoFi because at the time they had the best APR and access to all ATM for free (they don't have this policy anymore).

I don't know much about their home, college and auto loan business but i cant imagine people taking out a loan with SoFi just because they have a checking account. When i take out a loan, I'm looking at the rates first and everything else second. Convenience is nice but I'd suck it up if Chase is offering me a used car loan for 4% vs some other bank for 8%.

There are people that say Galileo is the key to SoFi, and this justifies people lumping SoFi into the fin-tech industry. But investing in SoFi because of Galileo is another issue all together, and right now, Galileo is about 1/8 of SoFi's business.

I should also say that I haven't dug deep into SoFi, but everything i've looked at so far has told me it's a bank trading like a tech company."

Their stock currently sells for $4 a share however many stock analysts are confident that the stock will rise to between $7 to $9 a share before the year is up. My belief is that this will happen for 2 reasons the first being that the company has actual growth plans that will lead to more mines being open which will generate significantly more revenue for the company and their investors the second being that major brokerage companies are sitting on this stock and waiting to promote it later to their rich clients they'll buy up thousands of shares for next to nothing and almost overnight there investments will triple and B2 Gold will be able to expand and once again the rich get richer.

stocks,"Alexion acquisition by Astrazeneca closing in I was typing this post as a question, but since I have now solved the question while I had almost finished writing the post, I will share it anyway, as a news item.

In December 2020 it was [announced](https://www.astrazeneca.com/media-centre/press-releases/2020/astrazeneca-to-acquire-alexion.html) that Alexion ($ALXN) and Astrazeneca stroke a deal, where Astrazeneca would fully acquire Alexion. The deal is as follows: *""Alexion shareholders will receive* ***$60 in cash and 2.1243 AstraZeneca American Depositary Shares (ADSs)*** *(each ADS representing one-half of one (1/2) ordinary share of AstraZeneca, as evidenced by American Depositary Receipts (ADRs))* ***for each Alexion share****. Based on AstraZeneca's reference average ADR price of $54.14, this implies total consideration to Alexion shareholders of $39bn or $175 per share.  The boards of directors of both companies have unanimously approved the acquisition. Subject to receipt of regulatory clearances and approval by shareholders of both companies, the acquisition is* ***expected to close in Q3 2021****, and upon completion, Alexion shareholders will own c.15% of the combined company.""*

At the time of the announcement, the share price of $ALXN shot from $120 to $156.  In April 2021 the US [gave clearance](https://www.astrazeneca.com/media-centre/press-releases/2021/us-clearance-of-proposed-acquisition-of-alexion.html) to the deal. On May 11 2021, shareholders of Alexion [approved](https://ir.alexion.com/news-releases/news-release-details/alexion-shareholders-approve-acquisition-astrazeneca) the acquisition, and this week the EU [approved](https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/astrazeneca-s-39b-alexion-buyout-scores-eu-s-blessing-but-awaits-key-nod-from-uk) the buyout.

The Alexion shareholders now have the option to receive the stock value by receiving either 2.1243 shares of Astrazeneca -ADR- traded at the NASDAQ, or by receiving 1.06215 ordinary shares of Astrazeneca traded at the LSE. Regardless of this choice, the acquired stock value at Astrazeneca's currently traded price is about $125, totalling the deal at circa $185 per share, slightly above the currently traded price of $182."

stocks,"Every investor needs to learn what a rule 10b5-1 plan is and stop panicking every time a company insider sells some shares! Some of the most common FUD I see on here is ""OMG the company executives are selling stocks! They know the company is going to tank...SELL SELL SELL!""

But this panic is from misguided investors (or people purposely trying to sew doubt), and not actually how it works at all in a lot of cases. Most people are aware that company insiders are beholden to very strict regulations regarding insider trading. In the most simple terms, they are not allowed to trade their company stock (buy shares, sell shares, execute options, anything) based on  MNPI (Material Non Public Information)...ie they can't make any moves based on any important information about the company that the public does not have.  

The rule outlining prosecution of these insider trading violations is known as SEC Rule 10b5-1. 

The inherent problem is that this rule creates somewhat of a paradox. Company insiders obviously always know more than the public, so almost any trade they make could potentially be considered an insider trade. So how do executives trade their shares without violating the rule?

To get around this risk, many company executives are typically asked to sign what are known as 10b5-1 plans. This is essentially an agreement between themselves and a brokerage firm, outlining the exact price minimums they want to sell shares at, along with the volume and frequency. These plans are typically entered BEFORE shares are even issued, or pre-IPO if its a newly public company. 

The plan does 3 things ([https://ccbjournal.com/articles/the-10b5-1-plan-what-executives-need-to-know](https://ccbjournal.com/articles/the-10b5-1-plan-what-executives-need-to-know)):

* **Specifies the number of shares to be traded, along with the price and date of the purchase or sale; or**
* **Includes a written formula, algorithm or computer program for determining the number of shares to be traded and the price and the date of the trade; or**
* **Transfers trading authority to a third party not in possession of MNPI and prohibits the insider from exercising any subsequent influence over how, when or whether to make purchases or sales.**

The executive signs the agreement...and the brokerage carries out the trades based on the pre-determined instructions.

At the bottom of form 4 filings in the ""Explanation of Responses"" section, look for a note that says something like: "" (1) The sales reported in this Form 4 were effected pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan adopted by the Reporting Person""  

If you see that note, it means that insider has a 10b5-1 plan, the sale was pre-determined well in advance, and has 0 to do with the executive's sentiment towards the company.  It is 100% normal for executives to take share profit periodically to supplement their income, especially post-IPO. 

Now, these plans aren't bulletproof, and can be modified or suspended. But if the insider has any MNPI, they can get in deep shit if they're caught doing something shady. 

Over 57% of S&amp;P companies are under such a plan, and most new IPOs I see are doing them.

10b5-1 Plan...learn it, love it, and use it to tell FUDsters to GTFO"
stocks,"What's the best resource for trading free or cheap options without long waits and fast deposits? (Please, no RH, Charles, TD, or Chase, there are reasons why I don not consider these brokers.)

stocks,"Questions About Selling Options and When Would Someone Ever Want To Do It? I have experience buying options, both calls/puts, but confused on the selling side, and there doesn’t seem to be many great resources online. Most resources explain what it is, but doesn’t really explain it on the real world practical and strategy side, how to and when someone would physically want to use such a thing, so figured any help and explanation is greatly appreciated, even if it's just explaining 1-2 of these questions. 


1. Is it ever worth it to sell an option expiring in the next 1-2 weeks or should you just sell long-term options, several months into the future? I wanted to try short-term for an experiment, but seems like the profit margins and risk is meager and much more worth it to do long-term? 

2. Is it ever worth it or even smart to sell a put option at a strike price more than the current stock price? Looks like you get much more money, but at the same time, isn't it common sense the other side will exercise it, since the price is already above the current market price, so they'd of course want to sell it back? If you sell a put option at $70, and the stock is currently $65, doesn't it make common sense, if the stock drops anything below, since it already is, they'd obviously want to exercise and sell it to me for $70 to get it back? 
3. Can you exit an option you sold by buying it back? 
4. What scenarios and why would someone ever sell a call option? If you do naked, the risk is unlimited for very limited profit, if you do cover, you'd have to buy the shares ahead of time. Seems like if the stock rises, they'll obviously exercise it and you lose or simply don't gain much money, then if the stock drops, you get to keep the amount you sold the option for, then lose money on the covers you actually bought? Is there something I'm missing here? 
5. If you sell naked puts and physically have no amount of money to buy, do they just freeze your account or put you in debt, or what exactly happens?  

Thanks so much if anyone's able to explain even a part of it to me."

&amp;#x200B;

I currently own BABA and BAIDU.

&amp;#x200B;

BAIDU is one of my biggest holdings. I was waiting to break even to reduce my position, and almost managed to do so last week (my avg price is around 215, and last week it Baidu went up as high as 208). So I am still stuck with 235 shares, and currently incurring about 9.5K loss.

&amp;#x200B;

BABA used to be one of my biggest holdings as well. I started trimming it a while and I have sold most (on 3% profit), and now left only with 22 shares at avg price of 260 (about 24% down). 

Considering my Baidu holding is more than 10x my BABA, I am more concerned about that. Do you think I should trim a bit right now, say 25% or so, just in case things go even south? I was not afraid to risk more in Baidu with the last huge drop in Feb/March because that was mainly due to the archegos scandal (where the banks have to liquidate the holdings of archegos Baidu holdings to get back the money owed to them, at least that was my understanding), and not due to fundamentals and politics. I am still a strong believer in the company, but I think maybe it is too risky to put myself in the midst of political and economical tensions between China and USA, and the whims of the CCP.

stocks,"Why is the market dropping so much today? Its not the jobs report, well sort of. Allot of people asking why the market is dropping so much today. Its a combination of reasons including the Delta variant forcing many countries into lock downs, recent economic reports such as the services and manufacturing PMI and SMI showing peaking economic recovery, increased uncertainty over oil prices and the direction OPEC+ will take, and most important of all the market reaching a new extended peak. This is especially evident by the lower volumes recently and some key technical indicators flashing an over extension. 

In fact, just yesterday a senior analyst at Goldmen Sachs stated on a Bloomberg interview that the S&amp;P500 finally reached ""fair value"" and that  “When you’re at fair value, there is no margin for error,”. 

We might see tomorrow dropping as well, but I think the most important might not come until the inflation CPI report is released next Tuesday.

stocks,"Anticipating Pullback and Corrections via Options Open Interest - A Small Case Study of SPY, QQQ, and IWM Hey folks,

I'm a huge believer in anticipating stock movements based on options open interest. This will be a short post but it'll be worth your time.

First of all, what is open interest?

""**Open interest** indicates the total number of **open option contracts** that are currently out there"".

The word to remember here is ""open"" contracts. That means these are the contracts that people are sitting on, and have not sold yet. How can we use this information?

Basically, there are a couple of things I've observed in my backtests and some manual analysis.

1. Trends in open interest can anticipate stock directions. For instance, if call open interest keeps increasing while stock price stays almost the same, that can be an indication that a lot of people are buying calls, and are keeping their positions open. They wouldn't do it if they expect the price to stay the same or go down. This becomes really good when we see large changes in open interest
2. The opposite is true as well. If we see a huge decline in open interest of calls, that can mean people are not expecting any rally now and we might see a dip. This is the point I'm writing this post for.

Going forward with point # 2 above, if we look at the open interest for SPY, QQQ, and IWM from yesterday, we will see a clear pattern that signifies an anticipated dip. 

**$QQQ** open interest for calls and puts: [https://i.gyazo.com/64891f29341a8444a7789c6358fc0447.png](https://i.gyazo.com/64891f29341a8444a7789c6358fc0447.png)

**$IWM:** [https://i.gyazo.com/ffcfa8e5dbc0301d14338d375e0d9ce7.png](https://i.gyazo.com/ffcfa8e5dbc0301d14338d375e0d9ce7.png)

**$SPY:** [https://i.gyazo.com/8764dfc851a12c8b0e4dfd0d9ba0ba56.png](https://i.gyazo.com/8764dfc851a12c8b0e4dfd0d9ba0ba56.png)

You'll see a trend here. In all of these, either the PUTS open interest is increasing, or the calls open interest is decreasing. Both are signs of caution and looking at pre-market data today, this was a perfect way to anticipate that a downward move will happen soon.

Hope this is useful for everyone. I know some people are going to say this is hindsight, but I've been observing OI trends for the last 6 months, and they work really well.

Try it out with any other stock!!

Have a good day."

&gt;HONG KONG, July 8 (Reuters) - Chinese medical data group LinkDoc Technology Ltd [(LDOC.O)](https://www.reuters.com/companies/LDOC.O) has shelved plans for an IPO in the United States following [Beijing's clampdown on overseas listings by domestic firms](https://www.reuters.com/business/china-clampdown-could-spur-fresh-short-selling-us-listed-shares-says-s3-2021-07-07/), according to three sources with direct knowledge of the matter.  
&gt;  
&gt;It  is the first known Chinese firm to pull back from its IPO plans since  the crackdown began last week with an investigation by China's  cybersecurity regulator into ride-hailing giant Didi Global Inc [(DIDI.N)](https://www.reuters.com/companies/DIDI.N) just two days after it made its New York debut.  
&gt;  
&gt;Beijing  said on Tuesday that it would strengthen supervision of all Chinese  firms listed offshore, a sweeping regulatory shift that triggered a  sell-off in U.S.-listed Chinese stocks.

&amp;#x200B;

I watched all the videos linked on the article. I'm not too worried about the 25% dip in value. If you believe ride-hailing, or not even ride hailing but a single platform app which connects to multiple modes and products, is the future then this price is still a steal for Didi. It's a quarter of the price of UBER, yet China's market is vastly larger than America's. Let's also not forget that Didi bought out Uber.  In addition, the Chinese populace completely bypassed the manual check writing phase, credit cards and swiping, and manual taxi hailing. They went from billions of bicycles to suddenly ditching their bicycles and buying hundreds of millions of BUICKS for goodness sake, and a whole market of designated, professional drivers/chaffeurs. Didi is not going to disappear just like Wechat is not going to disappear. 

Chinese regulators are just able to do what American politicians often like to talk about but whose American regulators are not able to or cannot act swiftly enough to implement. China doesn't want to fail Didi, they merely want to ensure that because it's listed in America, America cannot use it's own laws to extract data from Chinese citizens or impose penalties/sanctions on high level Communist figures connected to the company. It's similar to the America move which does not want Huawei deployed in the US so that China cannot extract data from American citizens and companies. The difference is is that Huawei is a Chinese company so the American government has no financial reason and every political reason to scuttle Huawei, while promoting it's own brands. Didi, on the other hand, is a Chinese-developed and China based company with it's primary market and customers in China. The Chinese government is not going to kill it. They're just going make sure to that it's sealed legally and has figurative firewalls separating it from the reach of the American government."

stocks,"PulteGroup $PHM company analysis # Company Summary

PulteGroup is a residential home builder based in Atlanta and formed in 1956.  They are the fourth largest homebuilder in the US after $DHI, $LEN, and $NVR.  They have a number of different brands and are vertically integrated in the homebuilding process from purchasing undeveloped land to selling completed homes.  They develop communities with single family detached homes, townhouses, duplexes and condos.  Their target market is middle class Americans and they also develop residential communities focused on senior living in 23 different states.  45% of their customers are ‘moving up’, 31% are first time home buyers and 24% are purchasing senior living options.

When purchasing land, they claim they use well developed data models to predict socioeconomic trends for housing markets in cities and isolated communities.  The auditor seemed very optimistic about their computer models as compared to $MDC, a similar homebuilder.

They sell homes in two ways:

* Speculative homes: homes that have already been built.  PHM expects that these homes will be purchased based on their own analysis of the region
* Pre-ordered homes: homes that are customized by a committed buyer.  The buyer puts down some principal capital that is usually non-refundable and has to prove that they are adequately covered to purchase or finance the home.

They run a mortgage issuance segment that mostly issues mortgages to their homebuyers and then sells the mortgage to some other institution in order to reduce the risk on their own balance sheet.

They control 180,352 lots in total.  5000 in the NW, 15000 in the SE, 21000 in Florida, 9700 in the midwest, 16000 in texas, and 25000 in the west.  30% of lots are developed.  91, 363 of these lots are owned, and 88,989 are optioned.  43% of owned lots are developed and 16% of optioned lots are developed. See Note 2. At the bottom of the report for more info on the regions.

**Management overview:**

I’ve heard the grandson of the founder speak, and all I can say is it was a good decision keeping him out of the CEO position.  People have a good opinion of the company from what is on glassdoor.  There are a few comments about management being bureaucratic and putting unnecessary pressure on employees, but these only account for a small percentage of comments.

CEO: Ryan Marshall.  He has an accounting and business degree, but it looks like he has only ever worked for PHM.  He has over 20 years at PHM and his compensation was over 13 million dollars.  This seems way too high for a CEO of a company this size.  He has very good reviews on glassdoor (94% approval).

CFO: Bob O’Shaughnessy.  Has an accounting degree.  He has a much more diverse work experience than the CEO, but it isn’t in housing.  He spent 10 years at Ernst and Young, 14 years at Penske as the CFO, and then 10 years at PGH as CFO.  He has past CFO experience so I wouldn't be worried about him making irrational decisions.

## Addressable Market

This section is speculative, they do not provide a breakdown of their target markets so I had to do some reverse engineering to get to this conclusion.

Their main business is single family homes, which account for 85% of their revenue.  They talk vaguely about who they target, but it is quite clear to me after looking at the homes they sell that their target market is the middle class with a bit more in savings than most.  Their homes are good quality, and their senior living arrangements are standalone homes with a lot of customization and community amenities available.  From my analysis I think it is fair to state that their average buyer is in the upper middle class, and the retirees who buy homes have an average amount of savings, although there is serious interest from wealthier seniors.

## Risk

PHM is directly exposed to the volatility of the housing industry.  They are a middleman in real estate ownership and try to keep their inventory turnover below 36 months.  The way they purchase land is akin to dollar cost averaging.  They purchase land more frequently than 36 months, and their long term assets are constantly changing.  This brings us to the possibility of significant reduction in real estate value.  Sure they might lose paper value on their balance sheet but there is still a fixed selling price that they will generate significant operating cash flows from.

Thankfully, there is a very prominent event that is an example of the worst case scenario for homebuilders - [check this out](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/economy/reports/2017/04/13/430424/2008-housing-crisis/) if you don't know what I am talking about.  They took a big hit because of the dropoff of demand.  It took 6 years, or four housing cycles to build back to pre 2008 levels, and they had three years of negative earnings.  They managed to decrease debt and took the unfavorable but appropriate approach of selling 150 million shares, an increase of 60 percent.  Since then they have bought back those 150 million shares but who's to say there isn’t another housing crisis on the horizon?  I have looked closely at common and uncommon indicators and all I see is a lack of supply but there is obviously much more that I am completely blind to.

The mortgages they keep on their balance sheet are slightly worrisome, but when I think about it, if the homeowner defaults, the home will just be repossessed by PHM.  So not much of a concern.

They are vulnerable to commodity price inflation, but the distribution and acquisition of these works the same way as their land purchases do.  Non land inventory is purchased regardless of the price, and home prices tend to slightly outperform the general CPI so this doesn't really concern me as it balances out the same way as land purchases.

One unconventional risk they face is the lack of skilled laborers.  The average age of construction workers has increased by [two years in the past seven years](https://sgchorizon.com/construction-industry-workforce-getting-older).  There are more and more people going to post secondary school trying to make more money and do less work each year.  This really does pose a significant risk to PHM in the long run.  Less human capital supply means higher wages means lower margins means less operational cash generation means more debts and less cash means ultimately a more unstable and unhealthy business.  No matter what happens otherwise in the economy, I think this could be their biggest long term risk.

Their ‘in your face’ optimism in their annual report isn’t captivating me.  They also say that they think past stock price performance compared to the DOW home constructors index “represents a meaningful analysis for investors” ([Page 19](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/822416/000082241621000007/phm-20201231.htm) above the stock performance chart).  Again, this is really immature for the auditor to say this.  They have competitive financials and a good company, so there is no reason for the auditor to go so overboard when they prepare reports.  This stuff always makes me suspicious.

## Revenue Breakdown / Company segments

96% or revenue is from all homebuilding operations.  This figure is 10.7 Billion:

* 45% of their customers are not making their first purchase.  This section excludes seniors.
* 31% are first time home buyers.
* 24% are purchasing senior living options.

The remainder is from their financial services.  This figure is 0.362 Billion.

Their average annual output of homes was 24600 last year.  It has been growing slowly in the past three years at about 2% YoY.

## Industry position

Some of their competitors are $DHI, $LEN, $NVR, $TOL, $LGIH, and $KBH to list a few.  PHM has the lowest P/E and PEG, and their P/S AND P/B are average out of their competitors. Their D/E and margins are competitive, but they are lagging with their ROE/ROA/ROI.  Free cash flow is currently at about 30% of the market cap but this is not usually the case.

They have an estimated 6.1% market share in American residential construction.

## Overview/Growth and Developments

Growth: Revenue took a turn for the worse in the late 2000s, but since then it has almost returned to pre 2008 levels.  The growth has been very steady

Margins:

* Margins seem to hover between 8-13%, and there hasn't been much change over the years.  The values are the same before 2007

Net reinvestment:

* They have a BBB- Credit rating
* A lot of capital expenditures go towards land that is either held and sold or developed
* Not much R&amp;D that would benefit them.

Share buybacks:

* Share buybacks have been good since 2008.  They have shown that they are capable of taking action to add shareholder value
* Their massive issuance in 2008 also shows that they are willing to raise capital and diminish shareholder value if it is needed for the business.
* The implications are mixed here.  If I am looking from a shareholders perspective, then I would be skeptical of their excessive issuance in the past, but if I was looking at it as a long term business owner, it shows responsibility and willingness to sacrifice their reputation if it can keep their business strong.
* They have bought back almost all of the shares they issued in 2008.

Costs:

* They are consistently putting more money into paying off debts than they are taking out debt.
* One thing to consider in their operational costs is they are forced to pay market prices for commodities.  They don’t keep a lot of inventory so these costs may become harder to manage unless they raise home prices along with the CPI.  They have a 24-36 month lag behind the CPI in pricing their marketable assets because of the nature of the building contracts with their buyers.
* They had their second most successful year in 2020, and instead of massive bonuses they decided to:
   * Repay all 700M drawn on their revolving credit facility
   * Repurchase $75M in shares
   * Increase dividends by 17% (Why so much?  Invest back into the business or buy more shares)
   * Committed to an early completion of notes due 2026-7 (Done Mar ‘21)

Debts:

* They have 411M in financial services debt and 2.752B in Notes payable.
* The notes payable is adequately spread over 15 years.  The highest interest is 7.9% due 2032 and the average interest rate is 5.5%.  As long as their operations are at least half as strong, their debt won’t be a problem.  Interest expenses and retirement on these on average will cost them 180M/year
* Financial services debt is of no concern with an average interest rate of 3%.

Assets:

* Assets have grown since 2011.
* They have just under 13 B in assets
* They currently have less assets then they did in 2005-06
* Most of their assets are in PPE but they still keep 3.2 B in current assets.

WACC: 8.5%

Long term growth rate: They will grow with the housing market, but also shrink with it.  3.5-3.8% organic growth per year is reasonable.

Legal: Nothing

Recent/expected developments:

* They have 13657 homes in production currently, with 10421 of those already sold.
* No expected developments

## Industry advantages

Suppose this data driven model they talk about really can predict socioeconomic trends in neighborhoods or to-be neighborhoods.  This would offer huge profitability advantages for them, but unfortunately so far their margins and growth are pretty in par with the industry.

They do have an advantage as a publicly traded company of their size.  Lots of access to capital and large capital reserves make it easy for them to have many operations simultaneously in different parts of the country.

They have a healthier history internally compared to competitors.  Their finances have stayed intact even in the worst case scenario and they have shown a better than average ability to rebound after hardship.  This is because of the financial maturity and responsibility management has taken over the years and hopefully this is a culture that continues in the business.

## Sell side VS Buy side

I am more bullish on this one, but here are two arguments for two different opinions.  I will limit them to five points each:

**Sell:**

* They did not hesitate to reduce shareholder value in 2008 instead of alternate debt financing.  This shows that they are willing to do it again.
* Prevailing sentiment is split - there is a possibility of a massive real estate crash in the near future
* Economic conditions are favorable right not, but it is expected that they will not be as favorable in the future
* Some of their corporate paper is sold at quite a high yield, which may be grounds for default if they do not sell shares or more debt in the event of financial difficulties.
* The demand for skilled workers is and will be rising, making it more difficult for PHM to acquire valuable human capital without raising wages.

**Buy:**

* They have steady organic growth
* Management has shown more than once that they are responsible.  In bad times they are capable of sacrificing shareholder value for more shareholder value in the future.  In good times they make good on future obligations early and don’t get too euphoric with expansions and bonuses.
* Their asset and debt structures are very attractive - with adequate coverage of debts and not a lot of outstanding obligations
* They have great ability to generate lots of capital in good times and store that capital away.
* The economic conditions indicate a shortage of residential housing, so even if there is an economic catastrophe in the near future, PHM and other homebuilders will still be needed to fill a 5.5 million house void in the country.  This figure is only going to grow too without federal intervention which either way is advantageous for PHM.

## Valuation

Assuming a dividend growth of 1 %, a 3.8% expected growth from the company and an 8% rate of return, the Gordon model gives them a $10.7 valuation per share. Their intrinsic value calculated from the DCF model is between $70-100, giving an average margin of 35%.  Of course the DCF model makes the assumption that OCF and investments will be stable and follow my predicted growth rates, so this is a subjective valuation no matter how accurate I think it may be.

## Valuation Market Comparison

The average intrinsic values I have found for the industry show that the industry is overvalued by about 15%, giving PHM a potential relative valuation of 50% undervalued.

## Opinion

I would give $PHM a buy rating.  They have a strong, cash generating business model.  There is more risk associated with owning them than a comparable consumer staples business, but there is also much more potential reward and in my opinion the reward is more likely to be realized than the risk.  This is something I would be comfortable holding in my portfolio.

stocks,"The Nasdaq and market keep making record highs, my watch lists are a sea of red. What gives? Are we already in a correction? Thoughts? So what does that mean, the market has turned upside down? What does that mean when the Nasdaq is hitting new highs everyday but many of the stocks I watch are down? What is this divergence? Is the Nasdaq index accurate? What stocks are actually up?

So yesterday 7/6/2021, I was surfing on Reddit and I did come across some Warren Buffet videos. The oracle of Omaha and well deserved. I have read a couple of his books maybe 10-12 years ago, read much about him but actually didn't see these videos until yesterday. In a nut shell he stated that you can not time the markets, no one can time the market, the best time to buy, is when you first see value and if anything but it in increments. The 2nd thing he stated was that he does not buy anything where he does not see value..... if it does not make money now..... because you can not predict the future, ""a bird in the hand right now, is worth 2 more in the bush."" That means if you have a solid company making money now, do not jump ship and buy/speculate on something that is losing money/growing or for the short term perceives to be doing alot better. This paragraph will become important as I answer these questions. I hope to help calm everyones' nerves with the answers to these questions.

I have wrote in many posts, as far back as a few weeks that the market is upside down, ever since the Nasdaq was at 13,800-14,000 and fed Powell was about to speak. The market upside down is when stocks that make money, have cash, give dividends, have the ability to buyback shares, raise dividends are falling like knives. Something like AFIN dipped under 8! NYCB under 11! (Again today, thanx for the trade), NYMT under 4.50 (Here we go again).. These are stocks that I constantly trade, and tell the elite team to trade when we are forced to pivot and seek safety. Why? Because they can do all of those things....... A company that does not make money, can not buy shares, can not raise dividends, and even as the stock drops they want to print more shares..

Many followers and the elite team are asking me what do I think is going on, why is the Nasdaq making new highs but I see a sea of red? So, I did alot of digging this week. The Nasdaq is indeed a cap weighted Index.. So is the SP and Nasdaq 100 are all cap weighted. That means as the market cap of a company grows (That is the overall value of a company) the meaning and weight it carries on the index grows as well....Why does this matter? The big 5, AAPL, MSFT, AMZN, GOOG, FB... account for 40% of the nasdaq!!!! Look it up! I just did, because I am supposed to be all knowing! You guys do keep me sharp! AAPL alone accounts for 12% of the nasdaq index and nearly 20% of QQQ (Nasdaq 100). The Nasdaq has almost 5,000 tickers. So the fact that 5 company's can shift 40% or more! of the market means that 4,000 can call and 150 can be up and the NASDAQ can be up! Is that possible? Yesterday there were 4 decliners for every advancer.. (4,000 down, 1,000 up) that is 7/6/2021. Today 7/7/2021 there were about 1.5 decliners for every advancer. (3,000 down and 2,000 up)..... In fact the US equity market is about 50 trillion and covers about 12-13,000 tickers amongst the NYSE, NASDAQ, AMEX and OTC... These 5 make up about 10 trillion!! So, just these 5 are 20% of the entire US market!! Yes! Now, I knew they were important and cap weighted I just didnt know how so..... because these stocks are making record all time highs, the Nasdaq is at 14,600-14,700 and its a sea of red. I started to see what was up and saw these mighty titans and some speculative stocks.. So that is your answer....... it is happening, why the Nasdaq is making new highs and I see a sea of red. So the Nasdaq is accurate, their is no mistake. Some stocks like SE, BILL are going sky high, LMND bouncing back but these are strictly speculative, snow.......

What is the danger in this? Why does it matter? Because I was even telling my elite team to me, we are already near a correction. If you take out 25 of the largest cap company's their is no doubt the Nasdaq is already down 5-10% but we cant see it! They have asked me other ways to track what is going on...... The only other way is to track other nasdaq important stocks to know, because if you track these 5 that mean the most, they are making highs. The danger in this is if they fall, it may cause a panic and speculative stocks will really crash! Because if the Nasdaq is at record highs and most people do not know its a few company's bringing up the market if the Nasdaq as a whole falls to 14,000 it may cause panic!

What do we do? I am going back defensive after I sell of some of my offensive stocks....Or I will buy an offensive stock after its down at least 5% on the day.....

Recall earlier the paragraph about Warren Buffet and buy value, cash cows, and buy more when fear is instilled elsewhere........ When the market started to turn upside down, an amazing value stock I had was TX, it dipped to 31, I did buy more, albeit in fear and traded it. It has bounced back to near 52 week highs as of today near 42. So that is a 30+ percent move in 2 weeks on a safe stock that makes cash! AFIN, BRMK, NYCB, they all recovered and made for great trades.... Today I am given another trading opportunity in NYCB and NYMT.......Now an offensive play, give it, these are Chinese are getting crushed and they are offensive. TIGR and VIPS. TIGR rose to 30!! It is now under 21...... VIPS dipped to 15 and change went back to 20.66 and has dropped this week because of DIDI (Chinese).. Same with TIGR.. I do own VIPS at 21.... I have been trading TIGR.... I just wanted you all to see what the difference is of a defensive play making tons of cash \[1 in the hand, 2 in the bush\]..... Now I do believe VIPS and TIGR are 2 offensive plays that should rise but we do have to be careful....

So in short, the market is upside down, being held by a few stocks. I refer to the Nasdaq as most of us trade tech/growth. I hope this explains much, and calms nerves for people with stocks that make cash!!!"
stocks,"Selling stocks now to invest when there is a downturn/correction?? Hello,

Eventually a correction is coming in the market. I think it’ll happen with 6 months.
When this happens, I’d like to have as much cash on hand as possible to buy on the dip. I was thinking of selling 10% of my portfolio for cash to buy on the dip.
But my question is, would it be wise to sell stocks I have now to get some cash? Or would the tax implications be that I’d be better off not selling and just holding, waiting for the dip to end? I live in the USA and most of the stocks I have are NOT considered “long term” by the IRS so I’d be at a tax disadvantage. I think only 20% of my portfolio is considered “long term” holding because I reinvested most of my portfolio fairly recently.

I don’t really know about the numbers involved so I’d appreciate the advice of people with more experience. Thanks.
My Money is in VOO, SCHD, VYMI, SCHP, BRKB, and VUG. I’m 28 years old and I am planning on using this money for my retirement when I’m 63-65 y/o. I am not really interested in buying other stocks, I think I’d prefer to stick to these but I’m open to suggestions.

Thanks."

stocks,"Rebalancing portfolio by buying only Hello
Does anyone have a formula to balance a portfolio by adding money and only buying stocks on “best effort basis”

Assume we have 5 stocks
And we want all to be 20% of the portfolio 
So if we have 1000$ it’ll easily be 200$ each (assume one unit = 1 dollar for ease)
No lets say time pass
And now their weight is 40-30-5-15-10
And the total value is 2000$
That means that the value is
800-600-100-300-200
Now we want to add 1000$
And we don’t want to sell
So we kinda have bazillion ways to balance it on best effort basis,
so here I’m asking - what do you think is the best way?
1. Get what you can to their percentage until things average down (try to pour the most into few stocks to get them to their desired percentage 
2. Split the value between all the stocks that their percentage is short to make them average up together
3. Anything that i didn’t think of that is better."

stocks,"OPEC+ Situation, no new deal yet, Oil price being shaken I have been Following the OPEC saga because 17% of my portfolio is invested in a triple leverage oil ETF (NRGU).

Here's what's going on: 

\-OPEC is in the driver's seat with the US not producing much more, and with a daily deficit of 2.2M oil barrel per day globally. Demand is going up, it is lucrative opportunity.

\-They have to catch up the losses from last year. A war is not in not in the favor of anyone

\- Saudi Arabia is playing the role of father: Being prudent, even if the economy looks better, we never know what will happen with that virus. Better to stay stable for a little while more, and to not produce much more.

\-United Arab Emirates (UAE) invested a lot before the pandemic to increase his production capacity. They see that it would be a golden opportunity to use it. They really want to diversify their economy for the future with that oil money. They don't want to miss the opportunity since the US might increase its production in 2022, and the global demand of oil will most likely trend downward.

\-On the new OPEC deal, everyone agree to only increase the production by 400k barrels per day until April 2022. There's no issue here, they must ""kill"" the extra supply.

\-Saudi Arabia wants to extend that 400k production beyond April 2022. UAE wants to produce more after that date. Looks like all the parties agree on everything except after April 2022.

\-Until a new agreement, the old deal stays: The supply won't increase by 400k barrels per day. This would push the oil price higher with the global demand that keeps increasing.

&amp;#x200B;

3 possible scenario:

1) No new deal: Keep the same production. This would shake the market with a lot of concerns on the short term (unpredictable). The UEA doesn't seem to be in a rush to conclude a new deal because everyone agrees to only increase the supply by only 400k. The present deal is good until April 2022, so it is not a big deal for them to ""extend"" the conversation. However, the longer it stays like that, the more it would be considerate as a relationship deterioration. 

2) New deal: The are men of honor, they come to an agreement. It is a good opportunity, and unlike last year, the market is favorable. They might plan to increase the production after April 2022 to a certain degree to satisfy everyone.

3) UAE leaves OPEC: It is highly unlikely. It is not in the interest of anyone to start a production war. They are stronger working together to control the supply (cartel), instead of being individualist in a free market. A production war would be bad for every body.

Conclusion: Short term uncertainty. In most cases, the oil price will stay high due to the low supply. Unlikely that UAE makes drama for weeks. So far, the present deal stands, the production stays low with a 2.2M deficit of barrels per day. Demand is projecting to keep going higher with the deconfinement.

It could be a buying opportunity with a nice risk/reward."
stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Wednesday, July 7, 2021 **PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, July 7, 2021**

Stocks finished higher again, with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ) once again recording fresh intraday highs thanks to continued strength in mega-cap tech stocks like Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), and Amazon (AMZN). The Dow Jones (DIA), which has been lagging the other two indexes the last six or so weeks, continued to underperform comparatively. Market participants are currently digesting the Fed’s June meeting minutes (basically notes of what was discussed) and are looking ahead to Q2 earnings season, which is set to kick off next week with big banks reporting. 

Oil prices remain under heavy pressure after recently reaching a multi-year high. In the latest meeting, the two most important members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), failed to reach a deal to increase crude oil production as energy demand rebounds. At the time of writing, Brent crude settled down $2.63 a barrel, or 3.4%, to $74.53, after hitting a session peak of $77.84, its highest since October 2018. The U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures settled down $1.79, or 2.4%, to $73.37 after touching $76.98, highest since November 2014. Some analysts have speculated that in light of the failure to reach a unilateral decision, individual oil producers may begin to act alone to increase production. Bob Yawger, Director of Energy Futures at Mizuho, said “The market is concerned that the UAE will step in and unilaterally add barrels and other members in OPEC will follow suit.” The White House said Tuesday it was closely monitoring talks by OPEC+ and was ""encouraged"" after conversations with officials in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.

For equity investors, the focus was squarely on the Federal Reserve’s June Meeting minutes, which will help market participants decipher that path forward for monetary policy and possible timelines for any adjustments. The Fed said the economic recovery “was generally seen as not having yet been met”, but said they are ready to act if inflationary pressures indeed begin to materialize. The minutes said, “Participants generally judged that, as a matter of prudent planning, it was important to be well positioned to reduce the pace of asset purchases, if appropriate, in response to unexpected economic developments, including faster-than anticipated progress toward the Committee’s goals or the emergence of risks that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals”. This is not surprising, as I have been saying for weeks now, as the pace of economic recovery improves, quantitative easing, or the purchase of government bonds in order to inject money into the economy, is always the first policy to be tapered. I am not worried about the tapering of quantitative easing and encourage everyone to read up about the 2013 Taper Tantrum, which happened when the Fed announced QE would be tapered since the economy had largely recovered from the 2008 crisis by then.

In short, the Federal Reserve is maintaining current policies in place but noted they were prepared to act if unforeseen pressures or progress to their goals emerged.Mark Haefele, Chief Investment Officer at UBS Global Wealth Management said of the minutes, “If the US economic recovery continues to accelerate to a sufficiently robust level into the summer, the Fed is expected to signal rolling back its asset purchases later this year. But the actual tapering would only take place in 2022, and we believe markets have largely priced in this expectation.” I fully agree, while I expect choppiness when the Fed makes more concrete statements about the taper timeline but do not see that derailing the current bull market. 

**Highlights**

* Lots of news surrounding Chinese ride-hailing giant Didi. Last week, the company went public on Thursday, however, over the weekend the Chinese government, in another crackdown of a large tech company, ordered Didi removed from app stores, citing cybersecurity complaints. Now there are reports coming out that Didi pressed ahead with the IPO despite the CCP suggesting the company delay due to “security concerns”. Shares are down double-digits in each of the sessions this week.
* The Labor Department's monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Summary showed U.S. job openings increased to 9.209 million in May. This followed a downwardly revised 9.193 million in April, which was brought down from the 9.286 million previously reported
* U.S. mortgage applications declined for a second straight week last week, declining to the lowest level in a year-and-a-half as home price growth and low housing inventories weighed further on purchasing activity. 
* Pentagon officials announced they terminated Microsoft’s massive $10 billion Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure (JEDI) cloud-computing contract and said they would start fresh with a new project, putting an end to a yearslong initiative that was unpopular in Congress and mired in litigation from Amazon (AMZN). In terminating the contract, officials said they focused largely on technical reasons, saying advances in cloud-computing in recent years have made JEDI obsolete.
* Yesterday, Nvidia (NVDA) unveiled the Cambridge-1, which the company claims is the most powerful supercomputer in the UK. The computer will be dedicated to studying and analyzing the healthcare industry.

I was thinking about this a while back after I had a telehealth appointment that took a fraction of the time I'd usually spend driving over and sitting in the waiting room. I did some reading and it seems like it's really taking hold and sticking around after the pandemic. So, how do I make money off it, right? Well, WELL is already becoming an empire in their industry. They're the largest clinic provider in Canada and they're a top 2 telehealth provider.

Along with their expansion in Canada, they've been buying up companies to break into the US, and they're getting ready for a NASDAQ IPO in Q4 with Fenwick &amp; West.

As for financials, they're maintaining $500M in Revenue and $100M in EBITDA, and they've got half a billion in credit lines which they've put towards their aggressive acquisitions and expansions. What blows my mind as well is that their recent cap raises all happened above the current stock price (at $9.80) so they're well positioned to buy back in at a profit if they want to, although I don't really see that happening.

stocks,"The relationship between intrinsic value and market price  The following is a slightly edited excerpt from the book Security Analysis. The passage was written in 1934 and it is amazing how valid it is today.

In security analysis, there are two general attitudes that go into determining the market price of securities. They are investment attitudes and speculative attitudes.

Speculative attitudes include the following:

Market factors:

* Technical factors
* Manipulative factors
* Psychological factors

Speculative and investment attitudes may share the following attitudes:

Future value factors:

* Management
* Competitive conditions
* Possible and probably changes in volume, price, and costs

Investment attitudes are distinct from speculative attitudes in that they asses objective intrinsic value factors:

Intrinsic value factors:

* Earnings
* Dividends
* Assets
* Capital and Debt Structure
* Terms of the issue
* Other metrics that are considered fact.

All of these factors together form the attitude of the public towards the issue - causing them to present bids and asks at the price they deem appropriate to exchanges that in turn forms the current market price. Of course there have been many new developments since this was written, but big banks scalping for a few cents per share on each trade doesn't change the facts above.

It seems like good practice to think about all of these before making a purchase or sale to form a final opinion on if the transaction is an investment or a speculation, and even to think about what the person on the opposite side of the transaction is thinking.

Also goes to show that if efficient market theory really does exist, then the value of equities may be extremely disjoint with what its financial intrinsic value is.

The purpose of this post is not to enrage or start an argument like how some people tend to interpret posts, but rather to create some discussion points and hopefully add to all of our knowledge base or at least make you take a second and think about it."

Also looking at price action around earnings reveals that there tends to be a decline into earnings with a several dollar rise following.

With entertainment, travel, and dining all reaching pre-covid levels it would make sense that their earnings would follow suit. I have 100 AUG 20 57.5C that I plan on trimming as price rises.

stocks,"Garrett Motion Inc (NASDAQ: GTX): Turbochargers For Everyone Garrett Motion is the world's largest manufacturer of automotive turbochargers with \~35% global market share and over $3 billion in annual revenue. A former Honeywell subsidiary, Garrett has been in the turbocharger business for over 60 years. The company, which has a cult following (see image of customer tattoos at the end of this email), shares a duopoly position with #2 market leader, BorgWarner (30% market share).

Garrett was spun out of Honeywell in late 2018 under the official guise of ""business simplification."" In reality, Honeywell used the spinoff to dump over $1.3 billion of asbestos litigation claims associated with its old Bendix brake business from the 1980s. As a result, Garrett was stuck making onerous annual payments to resolve asbestos claims associated with a business that it had nothing to do with. After numerous negotiation attempts with Honeywell failed, Garrett voluntarily filed for Ch. 11 in September 2020.

Companies usually often file for bankruptcy due to either liquidity or solvency issues. In most of these situations, the poor business economics that led to the bankruptcy in the first place have not changed post-restructuring. However, a third more rare reason for filing bankruptcy exists: to restructure a contingent liability that is unrelated to the core business. In this case, Garrett filed because it had more leverage in the Chapter 11 process to reduce its Honeywell asbestos payments. After a 7-month long reorganization and competitive auction process, GTX emerged in April 2021 with the original equity intact, a cleaner balance sheet, and significantly reduced asbestos liabilities.

As a quick industry overview, a turbocharger uses a vehicle's exhaust gas to spin a fan that forces more air (and thus more fuel) into an engine than it could otherwise naturally consume. It allows an engine to generate as much or more power than a larger non-turbo engine, thereby reducing emissions and improving fuel economy (by up to 20% and 40% for gasoline and diesel engines, respectively). As a result, the adoption of turbochargers has increased significantly over the last two decades as fuel efficiency and emission standards have become stricter across the world. In 2000, only 1% of light-duty vehicles came with turbochargers. By 2019, \~50% of all new light-duty vehicles produced globally came equipped with a turbo. This figure is growing annually (excluding 2020), as turbos continue to be heavily incorporated into both pure-ICE and hybrid vehicles. Thus, despite the looming shadow of electric vehicles, the global turbocharger industry is expected to grow at a \~10% CAGR until 2027, with Asia becoming the fastest growing and largest market.

Garrett has an impregnable competitive position with high barriers to entry in the industry. In fact, Bosche and Mahle, two of the largest auto suppliers in the world, formed a JV in 2008 to capitalize on the anticipated skyrocketing demand for turbochargers and in the process, try and break the Garrett/BorgWarner duopoly. Almost a decade later, despite the turbo market's actual growth surpassing all projections, Bosche and Mahle conceded and sold the JV to a Hong Kong PE firm in 2017. The reason was that they failed to achieve economies of scale and gave up trying to invest more capital to try and make more headway into the industry. Essentially, the 60+ years of engineering, product development, and auto OEM relationships at both Garrett and BorgWarner proved impossible to beat. Furthermore, turbochargers are incorporated into engines early in the design process and years in advance, leading to very high switching costs once production begins. This also gives GTX strong revenue visibility, with 95% of 2022, 88% of 2023, and 80% of 2024 revenues already contracted. The company is also well-diversified across geographies and customers.

The elephant in the room, of course, is electric vehicles. Since EVs have no exhaust, turbochargers will be nonexistent in a full EV world. However, we are still extremely far away from that, and even as the EV market continues to rapidly grow, it will only further speed up the adoption of turbochargers as the pressure ramps up on ICE and hybrids to become more fuel efficient and powerful. Furthermore, the proposed holding period for this investment is much shorter than the time it will take for the turbocharger market to begin declining due to EVs (likely closer to 2030 and beyond).

Currently, GTX shares trade at \~6x 2021 earnings and \~5x 2022 earnings vs. 12x and 11x at BorgWarner. GTX also has 20% higher EBITDA margins than Borg (18% vs. 15%) and nearly identical leverage (1.1x vs 0.9x). GTX is also growing revenues faster than BWA and the overall industry: Q1 2021 revenues came in +19% over Q1 2019 (since 2020 comparisons are irrelevant), while BWA Q1 2021 revenues were flat, and the global auto market was down more than 11% seasonally adjusted. Given that Garrett is growing by a double digit margin over both its largest competitor and the overall industry, it can even be argued that the stock deserves to trade at a premium to BWA. It has also become evident that management projected very conservative financials to its lenders during restructuring. This was likely to minimize the perceived value of the business while financing was lined up and to keep the stock price low as the new compensation structure and associated stock and option strike price awards were being set. To illustrate, Q1 2021 guidance given in late February to lenders was $868 million revenue and $129 million EBITDA. Actual numbers came out to $997 million revenue and $176 million EBITDA. Thus, there's a strong chance we will get the sweet spot of both multiple expansion and stronger-than-expected earnings growth.

Furthermore, several prominent PE firms and distressed debt hedge funds including Oaktree, Centerbridge, and Baupost led the company out of the restructuring process and provided most of the equity injection in the form of convertible preferred stock ($5.25 conversion price, 1:1 common). Including the now in-the-money preferred stock that will be mandatorily converted in under 2 years, these firms collectively own over 75% of GTX and are very incentivized to see the share price trade much higher.The stock was already uplisted onto the NASDAQ in early May, which provided a nice bump to the stock price. Remaining catalysts include the listing of the preferred stock, planned simplification of the capital structure (from currently equity + 2 classes of preferred stock + bank debt to just equity + bank debt), and continued strong financial performance. Full sell-side analyst coverage should also resume in the near future, further attracting more investor interest.

To conclude, Garrett did not enter restructuring because it had liquidity or solvency issues. In fact, the company continued to generate strong financial results throughout that time. Now that the company has emerged, we have the opportunity to buy a high-quality, growing business at a huge discount, thanks to the bankruptcy association (regardless of the reason). I expect the stock to re-rate significantly as the company continues to generate strong financial results, and the bankruptcy connotation wears off over time.

stocks,"WELL Health vs. CloudMD: Which TSX Growth Stock Should You Buy Right Now? TSX:WELL

In the past decade, growth stocks have crushed the broader indices, driven by a spectacular bull run in the equity markets. While the COVID-19 pandemic decimated the stock market in early 2020, the snap-back rally pushed major indices to record highs, primarily due to growth stocks in the technology space.

The shift towards telehealth solutions has accelerated in the last 15 months due to the need for social distancing and economic lockdowns imposed by several countries. However, this trend is likely to continue in 2021 and beyond, making WELL Health and CloudMD solid long-term bets.

WELL Health has been on an absolute tear since its IPO five years back. WELL stock has returned a staggering 8,700% after it went public, which means a $1,000 investment just after its IPO would be worth close to $88,000 today.

This astonishing growth has been supported by a strong uptick in sales and improvement in profit margins. WELL Health has increased sales from $5.9 million in 2018 to $50.24 million in 2020. Comparatively, its operating loss stood at $2.09 million in 2018, or 35.4% of sales, while in 2020, the company reported an operating loss of $10.4 million, or 20.7% of sales.

WELL Health stock is valued at a price-to-2022-sales multiple of 4.6, which is really cheap considering its growth estimates.

Both WELL Health and CloudMD are exciting bets for investors looking to beat the market. However, if I have to choose a winner, it would have to be WELL Health given its larger revenue base and lower valuation metrics.

It is simply a system I have developed over the years that I have found successful and easy to follow. This is purely for educational purposes for newer traders who may be looking for some reference as to what a trading system can look like. Would love to hear other people's system as well!*

Hello friends!

You may know me as the guy who writes the Daily Market Recaps on here. Today, I wanted to share a small article I wrote about trading systems. I remember when I was first getting started in the market and beginning my education, I would always hear people say ""you need a trading system in order to be successful"", but didn't know what that meant or how to get started. Fast forward a few years, I have been blessed enough to make a living as a trader and investor, so I wanted to share some of the things I have learned.

Basically, a trading system is a set of parameters designed to remove as much emotion from trading as possible (can't count how many mistakes I have made by getting too emotional during a trade). Today I wanted to share a very simple swing-trading system I use that only uses two indicators: Fibonacci retracements and moving averages (50, 200-day)

**Enter the trade with a plan** \- Before we enter any swing trade, we use technical analysis to find entry levels, price targets, and stop losses. Entering a trade without a plan leaves you ill-prepared to both profit if the trade works or cut your losses before the bag becomes too heavy.

**Find High Probability Entry Using Technical Analysis** \- As discussed above, I technical analysis to determine high probability levels of entry during a pullback. As a rule of thumb, always wait for confirmation that a support holds before entering a trade. I want to see either the stock bounce off the support with conviction or begin to consolidate, forming a new base near the new support.

* In an uptrend, the 50 day moving average (MA) or 23.6% and 38.2%  Fibonacci retracement are usually strong supports
* In a downtrend, the 200MA or 50% and 61.8% Fibonacci retracement are usually strong supports
* If a stock breaks below all these supports, wait for it to establish a new base for itself. The 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level and 200MA are the last lines of defense, do not try and catch a falling knife. Wait for the stock to begin building a new base, patience is key.

**Adhere to a 2:1 Risk/Reward ratio** \- When entering a trade, always make sure the reward is at least double the potential risk. This way, the profit from winners is always bigger than the potential loss from the losers. I do this by setting the stop loss at 50% of the potential profit we are targeting. For example, if I am targeting a 10% gain from a trade, the stop loss will be set 5% below entry. Of course, not all trades will work out but in this way, we maximize our wins while minimizing our losses

**Stick to your Stop Losses** \-  In trading stop losses are your friend. They protect your capital in case the trade goes sour. Even the best trader’s in the world don’t get it right anytime, protecting your capital is very important. While it might be tempting to “diamond hand” and wait for recovery, the goal of trading is not to become an investor. Cut your losses quickly before they become unmanageable and move on. There is opportunity every day in the market.

**If the trade works out, set stops to entry** \- If the trade starts working out, it is very important to then raise your stop loss and set it at your original entry price. This guarantees the trade will become risk-free, meaning you will either profit or, worst-case scenario, break even. If the trade is really working out and is up a good amount from entry, I will keep raising the stop loss to protect the profit. While trading, it is imperative never to let your gains become losses, at the worst we want to walk away from a trade breaking even."

Some pros and cons for both that I can think of:

**WBA Pros**:

\- Sitting on a lot of cash after selling Alliance business for $6.3 billion

\- Had a good earnings report where they beat estimates and showed good growth

\- Hired Rosalind Brewer as their new CEO, who was instrumental in Starbucks' digital transformation as their COO

\- They are looking to open up urgent care style clinics in their stores which will drive more traffic 

\- It offers a nice dividend of \~3.9%

**WBA Cons**:

\- Their most recent earning numbers were good largely in part due to the Covid vaccine rush, which they predicted would be a lot less next quarter and later in the year

\- Wallstreet analysts are still not very bullish on the stock with a Hold rating on it and a 1 yr price target of $54

**CVS Pros**:

\- also offers a nice dividend yield of 2.4%

\- has more favorable analyst ratings and a 1 yr price target of $95

\- has shown good growth and earnings 

\- their merger with Aetna will help drive more customers to the stores for their in-store clinics

**CVS Cons:**

\- could see a similar drop in traffic due to covid vaccine demands going down after summer

\- There are talks of Amazon moving into the pharmacy business but not sure how much of a threat that would pose and how realistic that is

I like the data presented on oncology drug revenue being a huge driver for the sector right now too and I'll highlight this passage:

In Deloitte’s 2021 Global Life Sciences Outlook\*, the data is even more compelling in favor of oncology companies. The firm states that “Beyond vaccines, oncology is expected to continue to be a major driver of the sector’s topline growth in 2021. Oncology accounts for six out of the 10 biggest new sales generators and four of the top 10 bestselling products. According to Evaluate, sales of COVID-19 vaccines though are expected to reach US$10 billion to US$15 billion in 2021, with the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine forecast to be the top seller. Evaluate predicts that Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine will be the market leader by 2026.”

Deloitte’s data clearly demonstrates the size and scope of cancer treatments. Merk’s (NYSE: MRK) Keytruda – a cancer drug – is expected to be a $2.7 Billion drug in 2021 as far as new sales are concerned. It’s further supported by expectations of more than $16 billion in 2021 sales, overall. Bristol Myers Squibb’s (NYSE: BMY) Revlimid and Opdivo are expected to do a combined $21.5 Billion this year. You’ve also got Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) &amp; Abbvie’s (NYSE: ABBV) Imbruvica, which EvaluatePharma expects 2021 sales to come in at $7.6 Billion.

There are chart images in there too showing that the majority of the ""Biggest selling drugs in 2021"" and the ""Biggest new sales generators: Products"" in 2021 are dominated by cancer treatments.

My point: I think it's time to find new opportunities for oncology treatment stocks. There's a hot M&amp;A climate, lots of money floating in the market post-covid, and plenty of proof points to look at for reference.  Can't complain about a 5-10x in less than a year here haha. Just my 2 cents. GLTA."

I wanted to post here and see if anyone has been talking about it. I recently invested a small amount into Newegg (NEGG). Like I said I am a very passive and beginner investor so therefore its only a small amount I invested (among a few others as well). However, Newegg has been soaring over the last week and I being a newer investor am wondering, should I sell and take a nice profit to invest elsewhere or do I ride it out and hope it doesn't take a dive.

I invested in Newegg because Ive shopped there for years and to me it was just a fun way to invest in a business I am familiar with. I did not expect it to go this high right away, but Im not complaining.

stocks,"China Considers Closing Loophole Used by Tech Giants for U.S. IPOs (Article in comments) [Archive](https://archive.ph/2021.07.07-075355/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-07/china-mulls-closing-loophole-used-by-tech-giants-for-u-s-ipos)

 

&gt;Regulators in Beijing are planning rule changes that would allow them to block a Chinese company from listing overseas even if the unit selling shares is incorporated outside China, closing a loophole long-used by the country’s technology giants, according to people familiar with the matter.  
&gt;  
&gt;The China Securities Regulatory Commission is leading efforts to revise rules on overseas listings that have been in effect since 1994 and make no reference to companies registered in places like the Cayman Islands, said the people, asking not to be identified discussing a private matter. Once amended, the rules would require firms structured using the so-called Variable Interest Entity model to seek approval before going public in Hong Kong or the U.S., the people said.  
&gt;  
&gt;The proposed change is the first indication of how Beijing plans to implement a crackdown on overseas listings flagged by the country’s State Council on Tuesday. Closer oversight would plug a gap that’s been used for two decades by technology giants from [Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.](https://archive.ph/o/J3w9m/https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/BABA:US) to [Tencent Holdings Ltd.](https://archive.ph/o/J3w9m/https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/700:HK) to attract foreign capital and list offshore, potentially thwarting the ambitions of firms like ByteDance Ltd. [contemplating](https://archive.ph/o/J3w9m/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-20/bytedance-founder-zhang-yiming-steps-down-as-ceo-ahead-of-ipo) going public outside the mainland.  
&gt;  
&gt;It would also threaten a lucrative line of business for Wall Street banks and add to concerns of a decoupling between China and the U.S. in sensitive areas like technology. Chinese firms have raised about $76 billion through first-time share sales in the U.S. over the past decade.  
&gt;  
&gt;The changes are subject to approval by the State Council, the people said. The securities regulator plans to discuss potential revisions with firms that underwrite share sales, one of the people said. The CSRC didn’t immediately respond to a fax seeking comment. Bloomberg News [reported](https://archive.ph/o/J3w9m/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-07/china-is-said-to-mull-tighter-rules-for-firms-listing-overseas) on the potential tightening in May.  
&gt;  
&gt;Pioneered by Sina Corp. and its investment bankers during a 2000 initial public offering, the [VIE framework](https://archive.ph/o/J3w9m/https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/quicktake/chinas-fraught-ipos) has never been formally endorsed by Beijing. It has nevertheless enabled Chinese companies to sidestep restrictions on foreign investment in sensitive sectors including the Internet industry. The structure allows a Chinese firm to transfer profits to an offshore entity -- registered in places like the Cayman Islands or the British Virgin Islands -- with shares that foreign investors can then own.  
&gt;  
&gt;While virtually every major Chinese internet company has used the structure, it’s become increasingly worrisome for Beijing as it tightens its grip on technology firms that have infiltrated every corner of Chinese life and control reams of consumer data. Authorities so far have little legal recourse to prevent sensitive overseas listings, as with the recent [Didi Global Inc.](https://archive.ph/o/J3w9m/https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/DIDI:US) IPO, which went ahead despite requests for a [delay](https://archive.ph/o/J3w9m/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-06/china-s-cyber-watchdog-asked-didi-to-delay-ipo-on-data-concerns) from regulators.  
&gt;  
&gt;The additional oversight could bestow a level of legitimacy on the VIE structure that’s been a perennial worry for global investors given the shaky legal ground on which it stands.  
&gt;  
&gt;China’s heightened regulatory scrutiny is echoed by tightening in the U.S. Recent [legislation](https://archive.ph/o/J3w9m/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-18/trump-signs-bill-that-could-remove-china-stock-listings-in-u-s) requires companies listed on U.S. bourses to allow inspectors to review their financial audits. China has long resisted letting the U.S. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board examine audits of firms whose shares trade in America, citing national security interests.  
&gt;  
&gt;The State Council [said](https://archive.ph/o/J3w9m/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-06/china-vows-to-ramp-up-scrutiny-of-data-at-listed-companies) Tuesday that rules for overseas listings will be revised while publicly-traded firms will be held accountable for keeping their data secure. China will also step up its regulatory oversight of companies trading in offshore markets, it said.  
&gt;  
&gt;Under the revised rules, VIEs like Alibaba that have already gone public may need approval for additional share offerings in the offshore market, according to the people familiar.  
&gt;  
&gt;The “political compromise” that allowed the VIE structure as a way around foreign ownership restrictions is “under serious threat,” said Martin Chorzempa, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, following the State Council’s statement. China “can now discourage its promising firms from listing abroad, which could boost its ambitions to develop financial markets on the mainland.”  
&gt;  
&gt;One firm has already suspended its work helping two Chinese companies using the VIE structure to list overseas after being advised by regulatory officials that new rules are being put in place, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.  
&gt;  
&gt;In recent days, China has intensified its crackdown on technology firms with the cyberspace regulator announcing a probe into Didi and pulling the company’s app from stores. Shares in Didi, which controls almost the entire ride-hailing market in China, plunged 20% in U.S. trading just days after a $4.4 billion IPO."

The chinese government can do whatever they want.

There are also a lot of frauds and shady    Financial reports, audits, delisting possibility etc.

So investing in tencent/baba do you think its worth it?"
stocks,"For the last time, please stop using fundamental metrics for Chinese stocks I am sick and tired of seeing pump and dump posts on BABA and the likes. For the last time, valuation metrics like PE ratio, EBIT, sales do not mean anything if those FCF will never go to investors. The fact that these companies are ""undervalued"" and flushed with cash without any plan for buyback or dividend mean that management do not view its share as having great value. Worse yet, foreign investors receiving dividend might set off the CCP into more crackdown on these companies.

There is no sense in applying traditional metrics that works in the US with a robust judicial system to Chinese companies. What happen if CCP decide to delist Didi or BABA tomorrow without compensating US investors or give them token amount? Are you going to a Chinese court for that? Good luck. FYI, most of the Chinese public (which is quite nationalistic) would cheer any such move of taking money away from Westerners as payback for the Century of Humiliations. China is not the US; you will never see the Chinese Supreme Court ordering Xi to hand over documents like SCOTUS did to Nixon. 

For stocks like these that have a real chance of going to zero, there is no point in using traditional metrics because the underlying fundamentals have been decoupled from its price. It's like the reverse image of TSLA (which also has its stock price decoupled from fundamentals in the opposite direction). Trade Chinese stocks; do not own them.  

China may one day become the most powerful and wealthy country on earth. That doesn't mean it will let you, the foreign investors, in on the ride.

This is not a thread about their long-term potential. It’s about a bullish move that’s happening but here’s a little info about who Gingko Bioworks is;

They are involved in several sectors;

-Pharmaceuticals &amp;amp; Therapeutics
-Agriculture
-Industrial materials
-Food industry

They currently have 70+ projects with plans to have 500+ by 2025. These projects will have the potential to turn into streams of revenue in perpetuity. Perpetuity a bond or other security with no fixed maturity date, so FOREVER.

Tweet from today @gingko;

“Our vision is to help create a waste-free, pollution-free world using biotechnology and engineered systems to degrade contaminants and epicycle waste.” 

The merger is set to take place in q3 (between now and September 2021). New ticker will be $DNA 

I’ve been watching the chart for weeks, and this week gave me confirmation on a move. Here’s the breakout by the way: https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NASDAQ-SRNG/

Let’s get to the trade:
$SRNG July 16 10C
OI 33K - yes, 33,000 (https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SRNG/options/)

These contracts are trading at 5-10 cents per share, or for 1 contract (100 shares), thats 5-10 dollars. This would change depending on share price, demand etc.

Daily volume for the last few weeks continues to be in the thousands, occasionally, hundreds

Delta 0.5

Gamma about 2 (TD ameritrade)

IV 6 percent - providing low premium

Current price is 10.02 based on AH trading. Some whale just bought 1.75M 
shares ABOVE NAV (PIPE got in at 10.0).

Above NAV, risk reward for the arb traders becomes non-existent. Unit volume continues to dry out as that trade slows

Consistently seeing bids above 10 the last 2 days supporting the price.

Calls are ITM, and almost at break-even level.

Chart is showing a breakout.

We can talk about $SRNG valuation till blue in the face.

$SRNG name will be changed to $DNA after the merger, but none of that matters, all else equal, other than the fucking CEO talking about bringing dinosaurs back.

If a call is to be sold, and fully hedged, that means the dealer buys 100 shares, providing buying pressure, which is far more likely to happen when the call has a strike that’s ATM/ITM, and especially when that gamma is already very high.

I’ve been looking at options throughout the market, and I can’t find a gamma on an option like this anywhere else on the market.

Criteria for a move:

Low IV on contracts - check

Options with a low premium (low risk) trading with a high OI, providing liquidity - check

Options trading ITM so that they need to be hedged - check

TD Ameritrade, Unusual Whales, and other accounts tracking options flow - check

Almost non-existent put volume, no one is betting for this shit to go down, and why would they? - check

Whale buying above NAV - 1.75M shares bought after hours at 10.03 on Friday. - check

Not enough movement or confidence in the trade, trade flag or down

If 5000 people buy 50 calls, shares that need to be bought to hedge - 25M shares (assuming they cover fully, which they would ITM) about 14% of the shares float

If 50,000 people buy 50 calls, shares that need to be bought to hedge - 250M shares (assuming they cover fully, which they would ITM) about 144% of the float

These are just ballpark numbers. A whale could buy a lot, etc.

**** KEY POINT Per 13F, the institutional shares held us https://whalewisdom.com/stock/srngu - 117M. Now that’s on the units. It IS 1:1. So we can assume that 117M was held on shares too, that could have changed now, but with an institutional ownership of 117/172.5 (67%), which it may no longer be after DA. If that’s still nearly true, that reduces the “retail” float significantly. Not that tutes CANT sell, but they are looking to invest, NOT trade. Much less buying pressure would be required to move the stock, since they will be sitting tight

Additional value: If it moons, people will realize the company has the same name as the same stupid shit your grandma takes to help her memory, Ginkgo. Meme

Easy Sheet: 1 call contract = 10 dollars

So what could it payout?

According to options profit calculator: Stock price = 11; 1 call contract = 100 dollars, 10x Stock price = 15; 1 call contract = 500 dollars, 50x Stock price = 20: 1 call contract = 1000 dollars, 100x Stock price = 30; 1 call contract = 2000 dollars, 200x

TLDR: July 10C, high volume, high OI (33K) low premium, low IV/risk, high reward/potential, dealers hedge since all this shit is ITM

stocks,"How do I know or could tell if I overpaid for a stock? Is there a rule I could use? Strategy, is there a science? Explained I wanted to let everyone know there is an exact formula where you could tell if you overpaid for this stock, relative to its own history, relative to the market, and relative to the peers. Before I do this, I want to remind you I am not telling you what to do and I am not trying to talk down your security. These are facts, not opinions, and if you are upset about the facts, it is not my fault. It is your choice if you still decide to stay in the security or not. I also remind you that I do not control stock prices, bidders do, so just because fair value is far below doesn't mean it will ever hit that valuation as long as someone is willing to bid. For instance, and I dont think this will cause alot of anger, AMZN based on my evaluation is worth about $1,400..... It trades at $3,000+ but may never drop as long as someone is willing to bid.

**My own rule and this is my own no one says this or tells me this. Do not buy a company with 0 PE, a company that loses money (Bottom Line) Unless revenues/sales is growing at least 50% year over year (Top Line)** This is not to say that you can not make money on a company that loses money and has slower growth, I personally will pass and not take the risk.

So let's get into this and use company's that everyone knows. For each sector I will choose 3 different companies. Instead of boring you with all the exact top, bottom line numbers I am just telling you, ""**How to tell if I overpaid for my stock or I got a steal! Relative to that stock, relative to the stock market and relative to the sector""** By the way this isn't some made up theory or mumbo jumbo or some formula that analysts use to reinforce their sales targets. So please focus and pay attention. I will cover 2 sectors, 3 companies in these 2 sectors. You can do this for free yourself I am going to tell you how.

Banks

Banks are relatively stable, pay dividends, usually have steady earnings, sales and are usually a great conservative sector. **I like to use Morningstar, you can can probably get the information in many places but I am a creature of habit I have traded since 1995.**

The first bank I will look at is C Citigroup, 2/26/2021, Closing price of $66, PE ratio 13.52, EPS 4.87. These details are very important because I am trying to tell you how you can tell if you overpaid for this stock now, relative to its past, the market and its peers. **I go on morningstar, I type in the symbol, (By the way I am not going to tell you step by step for these 6 securities, this first 1 and thats it!!! Hopefully, you get the idea)** I then click on financials. Quickly I see a bunch of ratios, revenue growth, return on equity. I am telling you I love this site, if they were to charge me $20 a month I would pay it, but shhhh don't tell them. I then scroll down and I see 2017, 2018, 2019 and I see year to date. Now I do own JPM, and that will be discussed shortly, I dont want the reader to think there is any bias I am just telling you how to read this. I immediately see how slow the growth it is, it seems less then 5% (Top Line), Bottom Line EPS went up gradually as well. What does that mean? If last year you paid above $60 a share you are still getting a pretty good deal relative to itself because top line, bottom line does show some appreciation. There are other factors I am telling you a quick way. Relative to the market (S&amp;P) that is easy because the PE is 13.52 and it trades cheaper then the index (banks relatively do). Finally, is this a good buy or should I look at BAC or the leader (We pay a higher premium, multiple for industry leaders) JPM.

BOA Bank of America 34.71, PE ratio 18.55 EPS 1.87. Immediately you see sales and earnings are pretty much the same. So this should not be higher than it was last year, you can than check the chart. The numbers do not merit this 18.55 multiple. So if it was cheaper, I am sorry it should be! If you are holding BAC I am not saying sell, but you are now paying higher than last year. S&amp;P as we said, banks trade lower. Relative to C, I would buy C based on the fundamentals because their is more growth in top and bottom lines and it trades lower!!!

The Industry leader, many of us pay a premium and if it has a higher multiple you just pay for it, its natural. I do own it

JPM Chase, 115.08, PE ratio 34, EPS 3.38, Sales have gradually gone up but earnings have gone down, me personally, (and I do have it long term), after seeing these fundamentals if the next quarter they do not beat by a lot I would get out, there is a drop off in earnings and it has this PE.....I don't know exactly what it traded a year ago, but it deserves to be lower, so definitely do not pay more. This is the leader so trades above the SP. Relative to the peers and a drop off of earnings, I personally would not get in, it is trading at a higher premium and I am not sure if it deserves it.

**If you have a stock and you are unsure of its peers, go on yahoo finance type in the symbol and it usually shows you peers on the far right, it is important to see how it trades compared to its peers. Which I am going over on this next sector.**

**Finally it is very hard to use any formula for a company in the red, losing money because how can you calculate what you should pay for a loser!!**

Automobiles

Usually these are safe, have high debt though and have multiples near 10-15 because the debt and slowing growth.

F Ford 11.70, PE ratio 11, EPS 1.06, Sales are down and so is earnings. So relative to itself, and its trading near highs (I do own it) I would not add, last year about this time it was 8-9. People are paying a higher premium on EV and expect future... possible but the current numbers do not. Car's trade lower than SP. Lets see to its peers

GM General Motors 51.33, PE ratio 11.85 EPS 4.33, Sales are also down and earnings as well... So this is the same story and traders are paying a premium based on it's past hoping for a better future. SP same story and relative to F i would say these are trading about the same.

Industry leader

TM Toyota 147.93, PE ratio 12.11, EPS 12.21 Sales are actual even and earnings are actually up, I would say that this is actually cheap, so if you like TM this is a good entry point. Also, this is the leader and deserves a high PE. Relative to its peers, TM is much better, not even by a little.

Hope this helps, you can do this with any industry or stock."

Cramer just included SoFI as 1 of the post merger SPACs to buy now. SOFI has all buy ratings from analysts- with an initial $30 price target.  SoFI also has one of the highest short float % at around 45% (which meaning many Millions of shares have to he bought to cover those short positions). 


And with a market cap under $14B, SOFI is extremely undervalued (consider Robinhood going public later this summer around $40B.. likely to be $60B after 1st day of trading).  Buying SOFI anywhere near current prices- will definitely be a winner going forward.... and if SOFI gets several days of sustained volume... it is very likely to have a big run/squeeze combo in the immediate future. But its a definite big winner either way.  Not to mention a 2 for 1 deal... as Galileo will be worth just as much as SOFI- and an option to SPIN on in the Future (similar to EBay &amp; Paypal)

Fintech is becoming the next big disruptor- and Sofi is being positioned to be the real leader in this category (and currently- the dinosaur banks have market caps of 300B, $450B, etc). Not only is SOFI the only internet bank with the full slate of financial products...

stocks,"Gray television DD {$GTN} This DD isn't as long as usual.  I lost enthusiasm analyzing them.

**Summary if it is too long:**

Good company but future outlook is bleak.

**Summary of operations:**

They are a communications company.  They own a large number of television stations in the United States, with 24% coverage.

* They own 94 television stations
* Sales predominantly come from advertising online and on broadcast as well as some sort of retransmission fees.
* They are the largest owner of “top rated” local TV stations (See revenue breakdown).

They operate in many markets, predominately in eastern United states.  Two operating areas account for 8% of the companies revenues, so they have a diverse range of operating environments.  Here are the revenues generated from the 'big four' and from other:

* CBS accounts for 36% of revenues
* NBC accounts for 32% of revenues
* ABC … 14%
* Fox … 10%
* Other … 8%

Agreements with the big 4 are set to expire in December 2023, so they must be renewed before that date.  They operate in a wide range of Designated market areas (15-209) ([SEE HERE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_market)), and have potential to move in to the top 15.  70/94 of their stations were #1 in overall viewership in their respective markets.  There are a number of recognized risks, and they are discussed in their 10K in more depth than most.  CEO, CFO, general management seems competent.

Financial analysis:

Most revenue comes from retransmission costs.  Local news coverage is the second largest cluster.  Most of their liabilities are in the form of LTD.  Net income is growing.  Their finances are quite simple, and seem to be fundamentally strong.  Here is a comparison to GTN and the broadcasting industry:

|Metric|Industry AVG|$GTN|

:--|:--|:--|

|P/E|39.16|5.51|

|P/S|3.91|0.81|

|P/B|4.3|1.09|

|P/C|16.07|2.5|

|P/FCF|43.46|3.57|

|EPS Growth, 5y|16.32%|45.3%|

|Sales growth, 5y|21.67%|31.9%|

|Market Cap|8b|1.9B|

&amp;#x200B;

GTN clearly has some market potential, but is likely underpriced because it is tapping into an industry that will soon be overtaken by purely internet stations.  How many of us are going to pay for cable in 20 years? Probably none.

Opinion:

Sure, there is good value here.  But they are operating traditional television stations.  They are well connected and have financial health, but there is more future risk than reward.  I would give them a sell rating."

stocks,"Toronto Dominion Bank {$TD} due diligence **Short version:**

TD good and strong

**Long Version:**

TD:

TD is the sixth largest bank in north America. They have over 26 million customers. Their main operations are:

* Canadian retail (TD Canada trust, TD auto finance Canada, TD wealth Canada, td direct investing and TD insurance)
* American retail (TD bank, TD auto finance US, TD wealth US)
* TD securities

They have 14m online customers and 1.7t in assets. They implemented a deferral program which worked quite well in 2020. 25% of Canadian lending accounts took part in this program in April, and by late October, there were only 2.2 percent of accounts still participating. This likely artificially depressed some financial values such as cash flows, interest payments and accounts receivable which could have been reflected by a lower price, justified if one is speculating but truly an artificial value as loans return to normal. This program accounted for 45.7b in loans. Similar results were seen in America, with 11.9b in loans, representing 21% of accounts in April later transitioning to 5.2% of accounts. This is not as attractive as Canadian accounts, but is only 25% of the size, and a tiny fraction of balance sheet items, as well as having a shorter deferral period.

The bank recently carried out what they call the Schwab transaction, where they acquired 13.5% of the Schwab corporation. This transaction is healthy, and Schwab has about 80% of its market cap covered in cash alone, as well as 6b in FCF for a 120b cap.

TD has managed to increase revenue and net income in 2020. They allocated more capital for credit losses, but managed to pay less taxes likely in light of the current economic and societal situation.

**Business segment overview:**

They have 16m customers in Canada. This is almost half of the population, which likely will have a monopolizing effect. They have credit cards, auto finance services, business banking, merchant solutions, asset management services, and an insurance business in Canada. In the United States they have personal/business banking, and TD ameritrade.

They operate a wholesale banking segment which operates like any investment bank. This segment operates under the TD securities brand.

There is a vast segment called the corporate segment which does a number of different operations. These operations include technology solutions, shared services, treasury and balance sheet management (asset management?), marketing, human resources, finance risk management, compliance \[management\], legal, anti-money laundering, and ?other? Operations. It seems quite difficult to find information on this segment, other than it has a margin of about -20%, making it even more curious.

Segment analysis:

All segments other than corporate are profitable, and have similar margins around 25%.

Canadian retail has seen slight increases every year since 2018. Net income in this segment has been declining. A decrease in personal banking revenue by 750m was countered by a 200m increase in business banking, a 400m increase in wealth banking, and a 250m increase in insurance, resulting in increased revenue from 2019 to 2020. There is quite a high ROE for this segment.

US retail has seen stable, cyclical revenues with a macro up trend. Net income significantly dropped in 2020. Deposits grew in personal and business banking and in sweep. The ROE in this segment is significantly lower than in the Canadian retail segment.

In wholesale banking, there was a sharp increase in revenue and in net income. This segment has a ROE of 16.9. They were a part of a number of large name broker actions, acting as an intermediary. They carry out some trading, research, underwriting, securitization, trade finance, cash management, brokerage, and trade execution services in their global markets segment. In the corporate/investment banking sector they do corporate lending, debt/equity underwriting and advisory services.

The corporate segment is a number of service and control groups. It seems to manage tax items, treasury and balance sheet activities, and some other shady sounding operations. It seems like this segment manages some accounting, as well as some issuance of equities/debt equities.

The balance sheet is very large. There was a $300 billion increase from 2019-20. This was mostly related to a large increase in deposits. The bank has 718b in loans. Of these, only about 2b were stage three. Factoring in allowance for credit loss, there is a possible delinquency rate just below 2 percent at around 12b which is covered 15 times over by cash alone. With most liabilities in deposits, there is no immediate concern in the balance sheet. There are almost 200b in securities sold under repurchase agreements, which will be evaluated over at least 5 years, presenting again little threat.

The loans can be broken down into regional and segmental sections. Canadian residential mortgages account for 213billion of the loans. Mortgage delinquency rates in Canada are 0.23% as of Jan 31, 2021. This equates to about 212.5b in real value from the mortgage loans, although TD has allocated about 100 million less than I recommend. HELOCs account for another adjusted 95 billion. All together, personal loans account for 369.256b on the balance sheet. Conservatively taking delinquencies at 1b, this figure is adjusted to 268.256b for analytical purposes. Real estate represents about 40 billion in Canadian loans, and assorted business and government is another 115.2b, predominantly in the financial and consumer staples industries. All of these loans look healthy at first glance.

United states loans are similar. There are 100b in personal loans, 35.4b in real estate, and 148.3 in business and government with a similar allocation as the corresponding Canadian section under the same name. There is 9b in other international loans. The total is about 734.9b. There is about a 5.3 percent average increase YOY in pure volume of loans.

TD decisively estimates that 1.3b of loans are in stage 3, which may be a little conservative for most analysts. Preparing for up to one percent delinquency is in order because of the recent volatility in the market right now as well as in the Canadian economy as an expected third wave of Covid-19 expands its grasp. In table 33 of the 2020 annual report, they allocate 7 billion to credit losses which is much more reasonable because they account for stage 1 and 2 as well. In this time of great uncertainty, it is not unreasonable to change this estimate to 20b. The bank has apparent backing from the Canadian government so there is no immediate threat to allocate a tenth of capital reserves to delinquencies."
stocks,"Comparison of the Big 5 Canadian Banks Google analytics

Comparing the popularity of the google searches, using the insights query found [here](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;q=scotiabank,bmo,td,rbc,cibc), it is clear that TD is most searched for.  The focus of this research will be the Canadian markets, but it is important to consider the distribution of searches worldwide.  In Mexico, there is a heavy concentration of searches for Scotiabank.  In the US, TD dominates searches, as well as in the UK.  RBC and TD are both around 45% of searches in India.  There is an extreme concentration of searches for Scotiabank in Peru, and it is the only instance where there are more searches than in Canada for all 5 banks.  Overall, the relative distribution over 14 years is this:

Fig.1

|Bank|Average Interest over time, google searches (Index)|
|:-|:-|
|TD|79|
|RBC|36|
|Scotiabank|24|
|CIBC|21|
|BMO|20|

&amp;#x200B;

This doesn't tell us much other than that TD is likely present in the US at some scale, as well as Scotiabank in Peru.

Most data from Finviz, specifically from this query: [finviz.com](https://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=111&amp;f=cap_largeover,fa_pfcf_u5,geo_canada,ind_banksdiversified&amp;ft=4)

All five banks have managed to keep their Price/FCF below five, even during the post Covid bubble.  This forces a deeper analysis to be carried out.  Amazingly, all of their P/E ratios fall between 12 and 15.  The figure below corresponds to these values.

Fig 2.

&amp;#x200B;

|Bank|P/E|Price/FCF|
|:-|:-|:-|
|TD|12.66|0.59|
|RBC|14.59|1.18|
|Scotiabank|14.50|2.31|
|CIBC|13.65|1|
|BMO|13.99|1.28|
|Average|13.878|1.272|

Now a difference between a P/E or P/FCF of 2 is not grounds for elimination from consideration for almost any cases. However, it should be noted that TD appears to be the most favorable from these preliminary figures.

The next three values to be analyzed relate to earnings and sales.  Here, we start to see some differences between the banks, with TD managing to grow earnings significantly more than the other banks in the past 5 years.

Fig 3.

|Bank|P/S|EPS growth last 5y|Sales growth past 5y|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Scotiabank|3.36|\-1.30%|7.9%|
|RBC|5.22|3.1%|8.9%|
|BMO|4.46|2.8%|12.1%|
|CIBC|3.43|\-1.5%|8.8%|
|TD|4.58|8.8%|7.5%|
|Average|4.21|2.38%|9.04%|

&amp;#x200B;

TD is a clear winner in this section.  It would be ideal to bring the P/S down, but because the P/FCF is so high for all of the banks, it is not a worry.  TD is the only bank managing to become more efficient as they scale, which potentially shows an effective management team, or increasingly more profitable businesses, or both.  It is possible that the earnings increase may be a result of a lack of attention to other obligations or competitive endeavors, which could possibly hurt them in the future. CIBC and Scotiabank have managed to decrease earnings as they have increased sales, possibly hinting at ineffective management, or defective operations.  It is also possible that the lower earnings are a result of restructuring, which could be positive in the future.  All of these values will have to be analyzed much closer.

The analyst does suggest that a new measure be conceived to gauge growth sustainability.  The value would be determined by dividing EPS growth over a period, x, over Sales growth, over that same period, x.  The measure could be called the income growth sustainability measure, and is formatted as follows:

IGSM = EPS growth in the past x  / Sales growth in the past x years

Where at least one value must be positive for the calculation to be effective.  The value produced is unitless  The ideal value is 1, and deviations outside the range of 0.5 and1.5 are to be considered unsustainable.  This value is only rough estimate, and would have to be refactored t in order to be used commercially because it produces inaccurate values the further you stray from 1 (a value of 2 is clearly unsustainably, as well as a value of-1 with positive earnings).  Using the newly constructed equation, the figure below can be constructed.

Fig 4.

&amp;#x200B;

|Bank|IGSM|
|:-|:-|
|TD|1.17|
|RBC|0.34|
|Scotiabank|0.16|
|CIBC|\-0.17|
|BMO|0.23|

Again, TD clearly has the most sustainable growth.  An average is not computed here because of the nature of this value, and it will not be used to determine any conclusions.  A better evaluation of sustainable growth must be formulated.

No securities analysis is complete without analyzing the balance sheet.  All of the companies have a P/Cash ratio between 0.23-0.25, so those values do not need to be discussed on a relative basis.  Current ratios, D/E measures, and P/B are considered in the following figure.  Some of this information has to be sourced from [SEDAR](http://www.sedar.com/).  Just press “ctrl f” and type in “annual” to get to the reports.  Other data is from [Macrotrends](https://www.macrotrends.net/), probably the best source of long term information on the internet.

Fig 5.

|Bank|Current ratio|Debt to equity|Price to book|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|TD|0.93|0.13|1.68|
|RBC|0.90|0.11|2.02|
|Scotiabank|1.05|0.41|1.49|
|CIBC|1.03|0.12|1.46|
|BMO|0.98|0.14|1.42|
|Average|0.98|0.182|1.614|

All of the values, except for RBCs P/B and Scotiabanks debt to equity fall within range of their peers.  Objectively, these values are ridiculously strong, but nonetheless, we are looking for a winner among winners.

The last rudimentary fundamentals to be considered are some alternative financial ratios that work best when relatively compared.  This is the largest section.  We will be looking at all of the ROx’s, as well as PM and OM.

Fig 6. |Bank|ROE|ROI|ROA|Operating Margin|Profit margin| :--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--| |TD|13.50%|5.20%|0.70%|56.90%|36.30%| |RBC|14.30%|4.00%|0.70%|60.00%|36.10%| |Scotiabank|10.40%|17.30%|0.60%|51.20%|23.50%| |CIBC|10.90%|16.00%|0.50%|54.30%|25.40%| |BMO|10.30%|5.40%|0.50%|59.10%|24.20%| |Average|11.88%|9.58%|0.6%|56.3%|29.10%|

For the returns, Scotiabank and CIBC slightly ahead of the other three because of their exceptionally high ROI.  For operating margins, RBC and BMO are slightly above average, where Scotiabank is lagging behind.  TD and RBC have exceptionally higher profit margins.

Culminating the rudimentary analysis is a large comparison of Figures 2-6, excluding 4.  For each figure, a “winner” can be determined, and a “loser” can be determined.  Here are the overall rankings for each figure.

For figure 2, TD is the most attractive in both fields.  CIBC is the second most attractive for both fields.  The first two fall below the average P/E, but because of the limited deviation between banks, this is not a huge accomplishment.  The next two rankings are subjective.  BMO and RBC are tied for third.  Their percent difference between PEs and P/FCFs are quite similar for both of them, and each value carries similar importance.  Scotiabank is fourth

In figure three,  TD is again the winner.  Their sustainable growth is extremely attractive, despite having a higher P/S than the average.  BMO is second for the same reasons, and RBC is third because of their high P/S.  Scotiabank and CIBC are tied for fourth because they both have similar P/S ratios and their Sales growth to eps growth are similar.

For figure 5, CIBC is the slight winner.  Most values are very similar, but CIBC is in the top two for all categories.  Second is BMO, lagging slightly behind CIBC with their CR and D/E, but winning the P/B category.  Third is TD.  Fourth is RBC because of their higher than average P/B.  Last is scotiabank with the highest D/E ratio despite having stronger values in other fields.  Scotiabank is in last because this value is almost four times the next highest D/E, whereas the highest P/B is only \~25% greater than the best P/B ratio.

In judging figure 6, a higher priority is placed on profit margin.  Giving equal weighting to ROE, ROI and ROA, TD is the winner of figure 6.  RBC is very close behind.  CIBC is third, and Scotiabank is fourth.  BMO is last.

Fig 7. The results of the preliminary relative analysis

|Bank|Figure 2 ranking|Fig 3 ranking|Fig 5 ranking|Fig 6 ranking|Overall|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|TD|1|1|3|1|1|
|RBC|=3|3|4|2|3|
|Scotiabank|4|=4|5|4|5|
|CIBC|2|=4|1|3|2|
|BMO|=3|2|2|5|4|

Clearly, TD was the most attractive followed by CIBC.

Market analysis.  Data is mostly from [stockhouse](https://stockhouse.com/).

This section will analyze more sensitive factors of each company, such as short position, large and insider transactions, volatility, and other factors related to the current situation of the company.  It will be split into individual sections for each bank, as well as a composite section comparing some factors.

Lets begin with TD.  TD has a market cap of 150 billion, which is quite large for even american companies.  Their beta is 0.9, which will hopefully draw speculation away.  They have a dividend yield of 3.825%.  Not a lot of insider information is available, but most insiders have historically bought below 60 and sold at 70.  The current price is 65, but is extremely attractive.

|Bank|Market cap|Beta|Yield|Short interest|Sales|Assets|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|TD|150.24b|0.9|3.825%|0.33%|43b|1.7t|

BMO has a market cap of 74 billion, just about half that of TD.  They have a beta of 1.17, which is higher than desired.  They have a yield of 3.71% and a short interest of 0.59%.  Their yield is slightly lower than TD, despite having the higher beta.  Recent insider purchases have been below $90, and a number of sales have happened above 100.

|Bank|Market cap|Beta|Yield|Short interest|Sales|Assets|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|BMO|74b|1.17|3.71|0.59%|25b|0.95t|

CIBC has a market cap of 59 billion.  Their beta is 1, and their yield is 3.34.  Short interest is 0.98%.  There have been a number of insider sales above 100, and insider purchases below this number.

|Bank|Market cap|Beta|Yield|Short interest|Sales|Assets|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|CIBC|59b|1|3.34|0.98%|18b|0.73t|

RBC has a market cap of 134 billion.  Their beta is 0.79, which makes them quite attractive if considering their dividend. Their yield is 3.34.  Short interest is 0.34%. The buy/sell line is at around 80 for insiders.

|Bank|Market cap|Beta|Yield|Short interest|Sales|Assets|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|RBC|134b|0.79|3.64|0.34%|47b|1.62t|

Scotiabank has a market cap of 74 billion.  Their beta is 0.79, which makes them quite attractive if considering their dividend. Their yield is 3.34.  Short interest is 0.34%.  Scotiabanks buy/sell line is around 75 with a lot of deviation.

|Bank|Bank|Market cap|Market cap|Beta|Beta|Yield|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Yield|Short interest|Short interest|Sales|Sales|Assets|Assets|
|Overall|Scotiabank|TD|74b|150.24b|0.85|0.9|
|4.64|3.825%|0.34%|0.33%|31b|43b|1.14t|
|1.7t|3|BMO|74b|1.17|3.71%|0.59%|
|25b|0.95t|5|Scotiabank|74b|0.85|4.64%|
|0.34%|31b|1.14t|1|RBC|134b|0.79|
|3.64%|0.34%|47b|1.62t|2|CIBC|59b|
|1|3.34%|0.98%|18b|0.73t|4|Average|
|98b|0.942|3.83|0.516|32.8b|1.23t||

All five institutions have some attractive things and some ugly things in this table, relatively speaking.  Scotiabank's yield is offset by the low ranking it got in the previous relative analysis.  TD has the most attractive yield other than that, and the low short interest is reassuring.  RBCs low beta is very attractive, as well as their large sales and massive asset pool.  They are the second most attractive entry in the table after Scotiabank.  TD is third at a relatively neutral position.  CIBC is fourth and BMO is fifth because of BMOs large beta.

stocks,"Fubo TV Had the Biggest Gain for Virtual MVPDs In June with 312% - **Don't Miss the Boat w FUBO** App downloads of the major virtual MVPDs were up 63% in June, most likely driven by heavy sports content and the run up to the Summer Olympic Games in Tokyo, according to a report by Evercore ISI media analyst Vijay Jayant.

YouTube TV again accounted for the largest slice of overall vMVPD downloads -- 44% -- but it was sports-centric FuboTV that had the biggest year-over-year gain in the segment --312%, according to Jayant. FuboTV was a close second to YouTube TV in terms of download share (33%), followed by Sling TV (18%) and AT&amp;T TV (9%).

Virtual MVPD app download trends improved vs. the prior few months likely driven by the strong sports calendar and lead into the Olympics. May downloads rose 11% year-over-year, driven by FuboTV and YouTube TV. 

Similar to trends in prior months, YouTube continues to dominate in terms of vMVPD download market share followed by fuboTV, SlingTV, and AT&amp;T TV.

stocks,"An introduction to value traps  

Some of you don't need this post, but some definitely do. The purpose of this post is to shed light on issues with some of wall streets common ratios with profitable but shrinking, deceiving or problematic businesses.

A value trap is when a company looks like a great deal now, but in the past it has had strong fundamentals and the market has never realized this. It's hard to spot a value trap from one or even 5 years of fundamentals. Most become obvious after 5 years.

This happens for a number of reasons. There could be underlying business problems that are not reflected in the current financials like the phasing out of an industry. The company could also lack competitive advantages and are expected to fall father behind in years to come.

Take a look at Macy's (NYSE:M)

There are some obvious ways to fall into this trap. You could look at average earnings ad revenue, and compare it to the current market cap. Wow! pretty obvious discount. Average book value has been pretty good too.

But looking deeper into factors that are not as integrated into the common ratios like massively decreasing operating cash flows. The market outlook for departments stores has been very negative, thus creating a temporary value trap before Macy's business starts to really deteriorate.

(NYSE:SNEX)

One interesting case study is StoneX. They have massive revenues that show up on screeners and financial data websites, but in reality the revenue is recognized through their sales of commodities that are bought and sold StoneX, creating a net revenue from this operation of almost zero when accounting for the capital expenditures for these commodities. This is an example of a deceiver.

These are just some thoughts I have. They may not align with your opinions or they may be outright wrong.

I use [macrotrends.net](https://macrotrends.net/) to quickly look at long term data, but sometimes their data it completely wrong so you can't completely rely on them.

[u/Astronomer\_Soft](https://www.reddit.com/u/Astronomer_Soft/) made a great note on some common fundamentals that value traps have:

Easiest way to spot a value trap. Usually has many of these factors:

1. Generous dividend payout greater than free cash flow.
2. Recent history of declining revenues, profit margins and market share.
3. Lackluster management spouting off nonsense about unrealistic turnaround, restructuring, or acquisition plans.
4. Extremely low return on capital employed (soon to be addressed by massive write-offs of overvalued assets on the balance sheet)
5. Increasing debt, while financing costs of new debt is increasing and maturities getting shorter.
6. Reverse split to maintain minimum stock price for listing requirements."

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Tuesday, July 6, 2021. Please enjoy! **PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, July 6, 2021**

Stocks traded mixed today, with the Nasdaq (QQQ) reaching a fresh intraday high, driven higher by continued strength in mega-cap tech stocks. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) opened at a new all-time high but was unable to hold onto the gains throughout the day and finished modestly lower while the Dow Jones (DIA) fell roughly 0.6%. Each of the major indexes had jumped to fresh record closing highs on Friday, propelled by the June jobs report that showed a healthy pace of recovery in the labor market but that did not suggest an overheating economy. 

Last week,  the US Department of Labor released the Job June report, which showed a stronger-than-expected acceleration in hiring, with non-farm payrolls rising by 850,000, the sixth straight month of gains. The unemployment rate however, ticked slightly higher to 5.9%. Here are the numbers

* **Change in non-farm payrolls:** 850,000 vs. 720,000 expected and an upwardly revised 583,000 in May
* **Unemployment rate:** 5.9% vs. 5.6% expected and 5.8% in May 
* **Average hourly earnings, month-over-month:** 0.3% vs. 0.3% expected and a downwardly revised 0.4% in May
* **Average hourly earnings, year-over-year:** 3.6% vs. 3.6% expected and a downwardly revised 1.9% in May

Oil prices turned lower after recently climbing to a multi-year high amid a breakdown in discussion between the two largest members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates in a gridlock over production cuts. The meeting, whose purpose was to increase output given an increase in demand for energy, yielded no decision. In response, Saudi Arabia raised the August official selling prices of all crude oil it sells to Asia, according to the state’s oil producer Aramco. 

Goldman Sachs analyst Damien Courvalin said, “As negotiations continue, we estimate that most outcomes still implies higher prices in the coming months as the physical market tightens and with higher OPEC production that the group discussed needed by the global oil market next year. Price volatility will likely rise.”

Looking ahead, market participants are waiting for the release of the Federal Open Market Committee's June meeting minutes (basically notes of what was discussed), which will help reveal central bankers' thoughts around adjusting monetary policy as the economic recovery matures. The June meeting had marked a notable shift in the Fed's outlook, with the central bank signaling as many as two rate hikes by 2023. Subsequent public remarks revealed a number of committee members were also warming to the idea of a sooner-rather-than-later move to taper the Fed's crisis-era asset purchase program. In my opinion, it is extremely unlikely that the Fed will signal any acceleration in the timeline regarding interest rates but will not be surprised if more members discussed tapering quantitative easing in the coming months. 

Next week, earnings season for the Q2 kicks off, with big banks scheduled to report first. Earnings are expected to continue being super-charged by stronger than expected demand from savings-laden consumers that are finally emerging from lockdown  thanks to effective distribution of the coronavirus vaccine. So far, analysts are looking for S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 61.9% year-on-year in aggregate, according to FactSet data – an estimate UBS's Head of Equity Derivatives Research Stuart Kaiser said may still be ""need to be revised higher."" This would mark the fastest pace of earnings growth since Q4 of 2009. 

**Highlights**

* Pentagon officials announced they terminated Microsoft’s massive $10 billion Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure (JEDI) cloud-computing contract and said they would start fresh with a new project, putting an end to a yearslong initiative that was unpopular in Congress and mired in litigation from Amazon (AMZN). In terminating the contract, officials said they focused largely on technical reasons, saying advances in cloud-computing in recent years have made JEDI obsolete. AMZN stock rocketed up roughly 5% on the news. 
* Grubhub announced it plans to roll out food-delivering robots across US college campuses starting this fall. Seen a lot of reports about the growing influence of automation in deliveries. Recently, Dominos Pizza also announced it was rolling out an automated delivery robot. 
* Lots of news surrounding Chinese ride-hailing giant Didi. Last week, the company went public on Thursday, however, over the weekend the Chinese government, in another crackdown of a large tech company, ordered Didi removed from app stores, citing cybersecurity complaints. Now there are reports coming out that Didi pressed ahead with the IPO despite the CCP suggesting the company delay due to “security concerns”. Shares were down roughly 19%. 
* The Chairman of Weibo, which is basically like the Twitter of China, and a state investor are reportedly in talks to take the company private in a deal worth $20 billion and help facilitate the exit of major shareholder Alibaba (BABA). A lot of news coming out of China regarding big technology companies. 
* Ford Motor (F), which has probably been hurt the worst by the recent chip-shortage, said it only has 162,100 trucks and cars in dealer inventories, half what it was three months ago and roughly one-quarter the stock the company usually has. 
* **Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\*\***

For context: I started off with demo account and was doing amazingly on them, Libertex was my preferred platform because of how user friendly it was. Only my luck took a dark downward spiral today. I initially gained £500, and just when I was about to settle down for the rest of the day my greedy ass craved more, so I went and made the mistake of trusting the markets were my friend, only literally as soon as I press by, when the graph was looking solid af on its way up, EVERYTHING goes crashing right down to the bottom. I lost over £3,000 just like that. I tried seeking advice online, I tried getting the help of a few websites, but literally all of them only explain what investing is and the pros and cons of doing so, not how to invest.

Let's say for simplicity that I have a $1M portfolio which is 100% VTI.

I also want to sell monthly 0.3 delta puts of VTI on margin. If they end up ITM, I'm fine with rolling indefinitely even for minimal credit, so the only way I lose long-term is if the entire market crashes and I get a margin call.

*Advanced Markets -* MKSI products are also used in the industrial technologies, life and health sciences, research and defence. 

*International Markets -* Overseas sales accounts for around half of MKSI’s net revenues. Outwith the company’s US facilities MKSI benefits from overseas manufacturing facilities located in Austria, China, France, Germany, Israel, Italy, Mexico, Romania, Singapore,  and South Korea.

In a press release Tuesday, the Pentagon said that “due to evolving requirements, increased cloud conversancy, and industry advances, the JEDI Cloud contract no longer meets its needs.”  
&gt;  
&gt;But the fight over a cloud computing project does not appear to be completely over yet. The Pentagon said in the press release that it still needs enterprise-scale cloud capability and announced a new multi-vendor contract known as the Joint Warfighter Cloud Capability. The agency said it plans to solicit proposals from both Amazon and Microsoft for the contract, adding that they are the only cloud service providers that can meet its needs. But, it added, it will continue to do market research to see if others could also meet its specifications.

stocks,"$ATNX, Potential pharmaceutical stock I have been following Athenex ($ATNX) for several months now ever since their CRL (Complete Response Letter) from the FDA in regards to their Oral Paclitaxel. For those who don't know, Oral Paclitaxel is used to treat metastatic breast cancer and is a viable alternative (with higher overall response rates) to the standard IV Chemotherapy. Yes, it's never good news to get a CRL on a Phase 3 trial, but there is good news. As of this morning, July 6th, they released news that it had held a Type A meeting with the FDA in which they state, ""the FDA was supportive and encouraged the Company to continue development of oral paclitaxel and encequidar for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer."". In addition, Athenex intends to present a new clinical study to the FDA in Q4 of 2021. What this means is that Athenex will be collaborating very closely with the FDA in regards to getting necessary data for Oral Paclitaxel to be approved.

Additionally, Athenex currently has 13 other treatments in their clinical pipeline, 8 of which are currently in Phase 1+2 trials. Prior to the CRL, the stock was previously trading between $11-$15 which is what I believe it will return to in the coming months. Furthermore, they are nearing completion of their billion dollar manufacturing facility in Dunkirk, NY. It will be the first of its kind to be built in North America in the last 20 years. Moreover, as part of the Buffalo Billion Investment Development Plan, New York state in partnership with NYU has invested $200m towards the development of the facility to help develop and provide high-paying jobs in the western New York. Once completed, it's 409,000 sqft (38000m\^2) facility will be a cornerstone for its commercial manufacturing within the US. I do expect ATNX to release news of this in the upcoming weeks and I am expecting a bump jump in price.

also questions i had were.

1. does BP follow closely in comparison to USA (Shale oil) or OPEC?

2. what is the relationship between BP/USA vs OPEC? i.e. if OPEC increases production, does that hurt BP/USA oil production? ( I would assume yes? since it will drive prices down since Opec can afford low oil prices, while BP/USA cannot?)

3. i was confused because i would assume inverse relationship but with talks about Opec increasing production, all O&amp;G company went up. what is this relationship here?"
stocks,"ThreeD Capital is lead by a Canadian great, Sheldon Inwentash to bring a previous metals investment vehicle you can count on. CSE:IDK  
OTCQB:IDKFF

ThreeD Capital Inc. is a publicly-traded Canadian-based venture capital firm focused on opportunistic investments in companies in the junior resources and disruptive technologies sectors. ThreeD’s investment strategy is to invest in multiple private and public companies across a variety of sectors globally.

Lets start at the top with one of the greatest investors in Canadian history, Sheldon Inwentash. Very well-known in the investment community with a long standing reputation for creating great long lasting value for his shareholders. While at Pinetree, his accomplishments included investing in Queenston Mining, which was acquired by Osisko Mining Corp. for $550 million; Aurelian Resources, acquired by Kinross for $1.2 billion; and Gold Eagle Mines, acquired by Goldcorp for $1.5 billion. In 2007, he was also named an Ontario finalist for the Ernst &amp; Young entrepreneur-of-the-year award.

Sheldon founded ThreeD Capital in order to provide a unique investment opportunity for in several industries and sectors, most notably the early stages of small cap disruptive technologies and junior resource and mining company's. The focus tends to be towards precious metals. 

This is not a shocker at all, with all the inflation rumor's and numbers flying around it stands to reason that someone as smart and historically successful as Sheldon would be able to accurately asses the market and what will be profitable before the crowd finally realizes.

Currently, there are some key major investments ThreeD has taken. Most notably Bluesky Digital who has taken the initial investment of $500K all the way to over $5M. If that's not an investment you want to join, I'm not sure what is.

In total, they have investment a full $30M and came out happy  with a current fair value of $60M. Doubling your money with diversified, safe, and consistent profits sounds good to me.

stocks,"I analyze all those scraper posts and use it to make actual stock picks As some of you may know, I track Reddit scrapers to use sentiment data to tell me what trades I should make, how long I should hold, and what kind of percentage I should expect. ([Link 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m71xi8/a_month_of_tracking_stock_scrapers_for/), [Link 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/n5lead/results_of_30_days_of_tracking_all_reddit/), [Link 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/n5lec2/results_of_30_days_of_tracking_all_reddit/), post history has more)

**\* DISCLAIMER:** I have nothing to do with MillenialBets, I just got tired of updating multiple scraper spreadsheets a day so had to pick the most successful one. I chose MB. They don't have the best data and are pretty bare bones with the categories, but they're very easy to copy/paste into a spreadsheet. So I'll just be talking about them with this post

&amp;#x200B;

So far I've been tracking the data for a few months, although the spreadsheet will only reflect the last 30 days since I delete anything older. This keeps the trends fresh and up-to-date. You can tell that May was a really bullish month because the average returns were 12% with a confidence level of over 95%. Now that I've deleted anything before June 6th the average max returns are 7% with a confidence level of 90%.

What does this mean in english? If you pick the most successful categories you used to have a 95% chance of it going profitable, and the average max returns was 12% in 9 days. Now you have a 90% chance with an average max returns of 7% in 9 days. Since that is the MAX average I usually set my sell point at 5%.

&amp;#x200B;

[Here are some screenshots of how I use the data to determine stock picks](https://imgur.com/gallery/UBBJn3F)

&amp;#x200B;

So what's my success rate so far? Here's my success rate with my real world money over the last 2 weeks:

* Total Buys: **20**
* Total Sells: **15**
* Total Profitable: **14**
* Total Losses: **1**  

* Biggest Profit (shares): **12.75%**
* Biggest Profit (options): **55.51%**
* Smallest Profit (shares): **-12.22%** (I'm setting a new rule for myself that if something drops 3% I sell no matter what. That way a single loss doesn't wipe out multiple gains)
* Smallest Profit (options): **24.55%**
* Average turnaround time: **5.3%**  

* Initial Investment: **$9000**
* Current Total: **$11,914.12**
* Total Profit: **$2914.12**
* Average gain per trade: **$197.27 per trade every 5.3 days**

&amp;#x200B;

It seems the markets cooled down in June and the data is reflecting that. That probably explains why the data didn't hit max peak as often as it could have, even though it was overall very profitable. This means there will always be a little lag between the current market and the one being tracked. I may start deleting any data over 2 weeks old to ensure that the trends are as close to today as possible. It'll be a balancing act though, since I'd have trouble trusting in that little data."

- Current Dividend Yield is at 3.95%
- 3 year yield average: 3.51%
- Liquidity in the options market

- Based on the 3 year yield, stock price should be at around $53.50. It’s undervalued.

MY PLAN:
- Wait for stock price to hit $49
- Collect the 1% quarterly dividend and sell 2 covered calls for Oct 2021 @ 52.50 for $225 per contract.

- If the covered call is exercised, I make $5/share ($1,000) plus $450 on covered calls plus $100 on the dividend (1 quarters worth)
$1550 Profit on a $9500 investment: 16% in 4 months

stocks,"I analyzed the last 3 decades of stock market returns to determine if it makes sense to time the market! Here are the results! We have all heard it! -- “Time in the market beats timing the market”

At the same time, we are all to some extent guilty of trying to time the market. The market always seems to break some new all-time high records, so we wait for the inevitable crash/pullback to invest. It’s high time we put both strategies to test. Basically, what I wanted to analyze was

**Whether waiting for a crash to invest is a better investment strategy than staying invested?**

**Analysis**

For this, let’s take someone who started investing approximately 3 decades back (1993 to be exact). I created multiple investment scenarios as follows to understand the difference in returns if you

a. Invested at the exact right time when markets were lowest that particular year

b. Was extremely unlucky and just invested at the peak every year

c. Did not care about timing the market and invested at a random date every year

d. Just hoarded his cash and waited for a market crash to invest \[1\]  

For analysis simplicity, let’s assume that you were on a conservative side, never picked individual stocks, and always made your investments to S&amp;P500 \[2\]. For investment amount, consider that you started with investing $10K in 1993 and increased your investments by 5% for every subsequent year. So, you made a total investment of $623K over the last 29 years.  

**Results**

**Investment Returns SP500(1993-2021)**

|**Scenario**|**Return**|
|:-|:-|
|Invested only during a market crash|391.9%|
|Invested when markets were lowest every year|371.2%|
|Invested every month an equal amount|312.9%|
|Invested at a random date every year|303.2%|
|Invested when markets were highest every year|263.1%|

The analysis did throw up some interesting results. There’s a lot to unpack here and let’s break it down by each segment.

The most important insight is that **it’s virtually impossible to lose money over the long term in the market \[3\]**. Even if you were the unluckiest person and invested exactly at the very top each year, you will still end up having a 263% return on your invested amount.

At the opposite end of the spectrum, if you were somehow the luckiest person and invested only at the lowest point every year, you would have made a cool 100% more than someone who invested only at the top. Given both the hypothetical scenarios are extreme cases, let’s consider some more realistic scenarios.      

If you did not care about timing the market and invested a fixed amount each month/year, you would still make a shade over 300% on your investments.

Out of all the above scenarios, you would have made the most amount of money (a whopping 391% return) if you invested only during major crashes. In this type of investing, you would not invest in the stock market and keeps accumulating your cash position waiting for a crash.

While this seems like a good idea, in theory, it’s extremely difficult to execute properly in real life. The main limitations to investing during a crash strategy are

a. The current returns are calculated by investing at the very bottom of the crashes. It’s very difficult to identify the bottom of the crash while a crash is happening. You can end up investing midway through the crash and given that you are investing a significant chunk of capital you saved up, it can end up wiping out your portfolio.

b. [Identifying a crash itself is very hard](https://am.jpmorgan.com/us/en/asset-management/adv/insights/market-insights/market-updates/on-the-minds-of-investors/is-a-market-correction-coming/)

As we can see from the above chart, the years that we consider were great for the market in hindsight still had significant drops within the same year. So even when the market is down 10%, it becomes extremely difficult to know whether it’s going into a deeper crash or whether it’s going to bounce back up.

**Conclusion**

While the analysis did prove that waiting for the crash is theoretically the best strategy returns-wise, practically it’s very difficult to execute it.

For e.g., even if you predicted the 2020 Coronavirus crash correctly, where would be your entry point? The market was down 15% by Mar 6th, another 10% by Mar 13th, and then another 10% by March 20th for a total of 35%. If you did not get in at the absolute bottom, you would have lost a considerable sum of your investment without actually getting any benefits from the previous run-up.   

It is extremely enticing to be the guy who called the crash correctly and even if you are right, only getting in at the absolute bottom would only give you the best returns. Adding to this, in the last 20 years, 70% of the best days in the market happened within 14 days of the worst ones \[4\]. If you miss just any of those days waiting for an entry point, your returns would be substantially lower than someone who just stayed invested.

If you think you are in the select few who have the skills to identify a crash and the temperament to see the crash through to invest at the very bottom, you will make an absolute killing in the market! For the rest of us, continuous investment regardless of the market trends seems to be the better choice.

stocks,"China’s antitrust watchdog to block Tencent’s merger of Huya and Douyu [https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3139950/chinas-antitrust-watchdog-block-tencents-merger-huya-and-douyu](https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3139950/chinas-antitrust-watchdog-block-tencents-merger-huya-and-douyu)

China’s antitrust regulator is set to formally block Tencent Holdings’ plan to merge the country’s top two video game-streaming sites, Huya (HUYA) and Douyu (DOYU), three people familiar with the matter told Reuters.

Tencent has failed to come up with sufficient remedies to meet the State Administration for Market Regulation’s (SAMR) requirements on giving up exclusive rights, said two of the people.

The internet giant recently withdrew the merger application for antitrust review and refiled it after SAMR told the company it could not complete the review of the merger within 180 days since its first filing, one of them and a separate person said.

The people declined to be named as the information is private.

Tencent – China’s number one video game and social media company – Huya, Douyu and the SAMR did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment.

Separately, Tencent’s plan to take private search engine Sogou will be approved this month by SAMR, one of the people said. Reuters reported in April the regulator was ready to clear the plan.

Tencent first announced plans to merge Huya and Douyu last year in a tie-up designed to streamline its stakes in the firms, which were estimated by data firm MobTech to have an 80 per cent slice of a market worth more than US$3 billion and growing fast.

Huya and Douyu are ranked number one and number two, respectively, as China’s most popular video game-streaming sites, where users flock to watch esports tournaments and follow professional gamers.

Tencent is Huya’s biggest shareholder with 36.9 per cent and also owns over a third of Douyu, with both firms listed in the United States, and worth a combined US$6 billion in market value.

Reuters reported in March, citing people with knowledge of the matter, that Tencent was having to offer concessions in a plan to merge Huya and DouYu to resolve antitrust concerns."
stocks,"Morning Update for Tuesday, 07/06/21 Good morning everyone! I hope you had a nice 4th of July, and enjoyed the long weekend.

*This list is geared towards day trading. With the momentum watchlist especially, I am typically in and out very quickly, only occasionally longer than a couple minutes, usually faster scalps.* Always have a plan when you enter a trade (for profit taking and for taking a loss), and use proper risk management for your account.

**Main Watchlist:**

Gapping UP:

* AXP: Looking to open at new ATH. I'll be watching for a further breakout, particularly if it can hold up over 171.50. If it shows weakness, I'll be watching for an ORB setup to the downside.
* IR: Seems to be holding up over relevant SMA's. I'll be watching for more upwards movement if it can hold up over the 49 level. 
* SHEN: Saw a big day on Friday, I'll be watching for further momentum today. 
* MRIN: Up on momentum from the past few days of trading, will be worth keeping an eye on. 
* NEGG: I'll be watching for further momentum. Like MRIN, it could get over-extended, so just be cautious. 

Gapping DOWN:

* DIDI: Recent IPO hit by Chinese tech crackdown. Could provide shorting opportunities, particularly if it can't get back above 13.50.
* BABA: Gapping down below relevant SMA's. Possible support levels at 214 and 210. 
* XPEV: Looking to open right at the SMA(20). Could provide shorting opportunities below 41.85. 
* BIDU: Gapping down below relevant SMA's at the moment. 190 could serve as a support level, could see more downwards movement if it breaks down below that level. 
* CRSP: I'll be watching price action around the 145 level. If it holds up, there could be opportunities to go long. 
* PDD: Possible support at around 115, could see more downwards movement if it breaks down. Could provide opportunities to go long if it holds up. 

**Market Outlook:**

Stocks are looking at a somewhat mixed open after we saw a strong week in the market last week. China is cracking down on some of its tech companies, and we are seeing a reaction from the market. Things aren't looking great for DIDI, but I'll be following stocks like BABA, BIDU, NIO, etc. to see how the market reacts today. SPY is trading a bit under 434, and could be due for a pullback. DIA is trading just under 348, and I'm still bullish as long as it hold up over the key level of 345. Tech stocks continue recent strength, with QQQ set to make a new ATH once again. Gold, silver, and crude oil are all green this morning. EV stocks are mixed this morning, with Chinese EV's showing weakness at the moment. Meme stocks are showing some strength this morning and will be worth following, with AMC leading the way at the moment.

Remember to use proper risk management, by making sure you size appropriately for your account and have a plan for every trade you enter (both for taking profits and cutting losses). Happy trading everyone :)"
stocks,"Business Insider: Many top investors are predicting an epic market crash. [Michael Burry, Jeremy Grantham, and other top investors are predicting an epic market crash. Here are their gravest warnings so far](https://www.businessinsider.com/michael-burry-jeremy-grantham-predict-epic-stock-market-crash-warnings-2021-7?amp&amp;utm_source=reddit.com)

&amp;#x200B;

stocks,"Virgin Galactic ($SPCE) Upcoming Catalysts Hey everyone,

In case you don’t know what Virgin Galactic is I’ll provide a brief overview about their company:

-Virgin Galactic is a British-American spaceflight company that operates in the United States. It was founded by Richard Branson and his Virgin Group retains a 24% stake. It is developing commercial spacecraft and aims to provide suborbital spaceflights to space tourists.

Great! Now let’s talk about what they are expected to achieve in the future and their upcoming catalysts.

•First and foremost, THIS SUNDAY they’ll send the Billionaire and founder Sir Richard Branson to space! This means he will be the first billionaire to go to space while competing with Blue Origin (Jeff Bezos company- Former Amazon CEO). After this flight they will be ready to start commercialisation and start making revenue in early 2022. (On the earnings call they predict an estimated 400 flights per year in future years with major celebrities on board i.e Justin Bieber, Brad Pitt, Angelina Jolie, etc.)

•In addition, after the test flight Richard Branson is expected to make “an exciting announcement” [source (1:20)](https://twitter.com/virgingalactic/status/1410727434530422784?s=20) 

•The third catalyst is Jeff Bezos Blue Origin flight that will take place the 20th of July. This company is a competitor for Virgin Galactic and just like $SPCE they will start commercialisation after their flight. This is relevant catalysts due their auction showed us the high demand for the space tourism sector. The bid for one ticket topped a whooping $28 Million!

•Let’s not forget that in late 2020 Virgin Galactic signed an agreement with Rolls Royce to design super sonic jets. These jets are supposed to take you from New York to London in just 2 hours. Will there be an announcement about this later in the future? [source](https://www.virgingalactic.com/articles/virgin-galactic-unveils-mach-3-aircraft-design-for-high-speed-travel-and-signs-memorandum-of-understanding-with-rolls-royce/)

•Virgin Galactic is supposed to expand their fleet ([VS3 Imagine](https://www.virgingalactic.com/articles/virgin-galactic-unveils-vss-imagine-the-first-spaceship-iii-in-its-growing-fleet/) and expand operations into the UK in Cornwall Airport. Boris Johnson- UK prime minister recently authorised this airport for space related launches. [source](https://www.cornwalllive.com/news/cornwall-news/how-spaceport-cornwall-help-create-5547712)

•Lastly, there will be another flight later this year which will take the Italian Air Force to space for research. [source](https://www.virgingalactic.com/articles/virgin-galactic-and-italian-air-force-announce-world-first-government-contract-for-human-tended-research-flight/)

I hope this post was useful for you. It’s obvious this company has an exciting future ahead! ✅"

stocks,Could Tech Stocks underperform in 2022? So Tech has done phenomenally in 2020 and 2021.But I feel tech will take a back seat to other sectors next year. The reason I think this will be is due to the consensus around that everyone wants to invest in tech. The entire focus is mostly on tech stocks. Lots of retail investors have gotten into tech recently. So I feel tech could underperform in the near future despite good continued earnings. It shouldn't affect anyone's long term investments but those who are in for shorter time frame might want to be a little bit careful. What are your thoughts on this?
stocks,"Why is it considered normal when Congress subpoenas a CEO about anti trust but when China does it it's CCP interference and is seen as bad FB has gone through scandal after scandal, Zuckerberg has been subpoenaed and there's anti trust issues left and right yet FB stock has rallied like mad the last couple years with a valuation of $1trillion now..."
stocks,"Future shortage of renewables materialas, I'd like your opinion. So I expect in a near future that there will be shortage of many materials used in construction of electric cars, charging stations, solar panels, computers, and increasing interest in waters and farming.

I based that conclusion on climate change and how quickly it makes our lives uncomfortable. We switched focus towards electric vehicles a lot with multiple companies stating they will discontinue ICE vehicles. The cars need changing stations witch use a LOT of copper so I think the price of copper will skyrocket. Lithium, neodymium, cobalt, etc all essential for a future. Solar panels will have a boom imo because of governments support and because the electricity will go up so it will start to make some sweet profits. I see more and more focus on renewables with new generation of political and social activities.

Now what is your opinion on the topic and what would you play off??
Do you have some tactics already in place?
General opinion?"
stocks,"Why is it bad to put all our your eggs in one basket? So I have been thinking about diversification. I know it's basically a protection against stupidity, because it's likely that most stocks you pick won't outperform the market. 

What it I pick only one stock? I understand it's a higher risk, but doesn't it give you a better chance at beating the market than diversifying? If we assume that each stock I pick has a lower than 50% chance of beating the market, wouldn't going all in on one stock be the highest probability outcome? 

Note: I know that it's smarter to just buy ETFs. This is just a thought experiment."

It basically talks about the P/E ratio of the entire market and how it was dangerously high in 2013 (24.4 vs average of 16). It was reminiscent of the 2008 levels and caused a bit of a panic among investors who closely follow that metric. 

The article goes on to explain that this doesn't necessarily mean that a big crash is coming, but rather that it predicts lower long-term returns.  The punchline of the article is the following advice:

 *In other words, don't dump stocks and hide in cash because the CAPE is at 24. Rather, buy less, be cautious, and expect lower returns for years to come.* 

As we now know, the SP500 grew almost 250% since that article came out. An unprecedented growth. 

Just goes to show that no amount of data analysis will give you an accurate prediction of the market. The market does what it does and doesn't care about conforming to past events. Also, don't take these kinds of articles to heart, and don't try timing the market."

So im doing some research and I found out the capitol gains tax may become 40% if you make a million dollars or more in annual income. Right now it is 20% for long term gains but lets say it got increased to 40%. So lets say you were holding a stock for over a year with $100k and in one month it shot up 1000% and you somehow made 900k in profits in one month. Lets say i make 85k a year in wages. Would it be smarter to sell the stock before I get to a million dollars in annual income if the 40% capitol gains tax is increased? Would I make more money on 985k in annual income if I sold than if I got to lets say 1.2 million in profit from the investment + income and got put in the 40% capitol gains bracket under Bidens plan. Again this is totally hypothetical and if someone could answer it would be much appreciated im just wondering."

I would think it would be easy to demonstrate but I’m not finding anything. If a market order was submitted at the exact same time on RH vs a broker like fidelity, wouldn’t fidelity always provide the better price since it doesn’t use PFOF?

stocks,"Origin Materials (ORGN) Analysis ## Origin Materials

Origin Materials is a new ticker that recently completed its merger.  They have developed technology out of UC Davis which creates plastics out of scraps of organic material: wood pulp, rice hulls, sugar cane stalks, etc.  This process ends up capturing the carbon that would reenter the atmosphere when the scrap material decays into plastics making it an incredibly effective way to capture carbon.  [Deloitte did some independent analysis and showed it captures **300%** of the carbon used in the manufacturing process](https://mcusercontent.com/3a3602da39d977d961969416f/files/da051d96-6c8e-4492-b78e-d8774523cb4c/Deloitte_Origin_Materials_LCA_of_Coproducts.pdf) making it one of the first carbon **negative** production processes!

Not only that, but since they are using scrap material the production costs are not tied to inflation or any other material such as oil.  In fact, they estimate producing these bioplastics at a cost which will be competitive with current oil based plastics  - and that doesn’t even include any carbon credit incentives!  Currently there is a supply of something like 900x what the company forecasts needing when at full capacity, so this will continue to be a cost effective approach that **isn’t tied to a volatile commodity like oil, corn, or canola oil**. 

Positive EBITDA is still out at 2025, but from there things will scale *fast*.  Origin is currently building the Origin 1 plant due EOY 2022 which will be their testbed plant that is focused on refining and optimizing their full scale production for both current and future materials.  From there, EOY 2024 will mark the completion of their Origin 2 plant which will be a full production scale facility and also create a positive EBITDA.  From there, they plan for 5 more plants estimating a $2.3bln EBITDA by 2030!  This company has the potential to absolutely boom!

[Check out more information in their investor presentation](https://www.originmaterials.com/assets/uploads/Origin-Materials_Analyst-Day-Presentation_04.2021.pdf) - but based on their estimated revenue and growth, I put the stock *today* at a value of $22 lowball and $35 highball based on a DCF model (lowball 20% discount rate, highball 15% discount rate).  The lowball is also the analyst estimate - which is quite a premium to the $10 NAV where it is now.  Even if I estimate the Origin 2 plant is delayed by a full year, the current discounted value is $18 - and on top of that adding in a 33% risk discount it’s still worth $12, almost 50% above current value.

##Leadership

These folks know their chemistry.  Lots of names out of UC Davis where this tech was developed, so this isn’t just some pipe dream MBA bullshit.  They also have lots of leadership out of the chemicals production space from the likes of Dow Chemicals.  So that’s great on that level, but how do we know they will actually be able to execute?

Their board.  Chaired by Karen Richardson who is also a board member of BP.  They have Boon Sim who was part of the acquisition team and was a leader for both Credit Suisse and Temasek Holdings - aka the sovereign wealth fund of Singapore which is known for being one of the most sophisticated funds in the world.  Along with that, execs from Clorox, Dupont, and P&amp;G.  So tons of experience and connections with huge players.  I was on the fence until I saw who was on the board - now I’m stoked.  

## Insider Buying and Investment

Just before merger, [Charles Drucker bought an *additional* 650k shares](https://fintel.io/n/us/orgn) bringing his total ownership to 18.862,500 shares.  How often do you see the acquisition company CEO buying **more** shares of a stock they bring to market?  On top of that, [Apollo Funds invested $30m in Origin](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210615005650/en/Apollo-Funds-to-Invest-in-Artius-Acquisition-to-Support-Origin-Materials%E2%80%99-Mission-to-Accelerate-the-World%E2%80%99s-Transition-to-Net-Zero-Carbon) furthering my confidence in the company.  These things happening so close to merger is super bullish and shows continued interest in the company.  On June 25th, [Lior I. Amram and Evergreen InvestCo bought 10m shares](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1802457/000119312521207655/d72044dsc13g.htm) furthering the large long term investments in the company.  

## Shareholder Redemptions

It’s not all sunshine and rainbows, so not going to try and hide negative indicators.  [Shareholders redeemed 60% of the stock, or 43m shares](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1802457/000119312521206309/d152805d8k.htm).  This is a bit of a blow to their financing plan as they had a $246m cushion in building Origin 2.  

However, this is bad **only if the share price stays below 11.50**.  Why?  There are 35m public warrants out there currently.  Each cashless redemption of those warrants (public warrants typically don’t have a cash redemption) will net the company 15% more than the shares which were redeemed pre-merger.  So overall they are missing out on $430m, but will get $402m from the warrants and with the additional $30m from Apollo it brings them back up to $432m!  On top of that, the float size **is so much smaller now**.  And as MP materials did in May, they can force the redemption of these warrants to close the funding gap if they are at a higher price.

Overall, they lost out on money but also have lower total shares so the value of the stock remains approximately the same.  Now it’s just a matter of recapturing the potential capital for future funding - hopefully through warrant redemption.

## Ridiculously Tiny Float

So due to the above, the current available float is sitting at 29m - but wait, there’s…. Less?  With the buying mentioned above, this is reduced to only 18.23m shares.  That is tiny!  We are only starting to get a sense for institutional ownership.  There just aren’t that many shares available right now so that means the price will be heavily affected by even a small increase in demand.  More volatile?  Yes, but also will make a runup in price all the more likely.  That runup will enable the redemption of those warrants which puts ORGN back into a very comfortable spot.  Since that isn’t likely to happen in 1-2 years, l’m looking for a significant upside reward to the risk of the stock.  

## Market

The market is currently pegged at $1tln of potential, so there is tons of room for expansion.  But let’s take a look at [Danimer Scientific](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/DNMR?p=DNMR) who was another company which merged last year and also looks to produce bioplastics.  If you look at their [investor presentation](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_5a9a2e12de478719519bf23247d0e8d2/danimerscientific/db/1089/9658/pdf/Project+Green+PIPE+Presentation__Final.pdf) you can see they are further along, but their **maximum** production after all their facilities are built is just a little above what **one** of the 6 production plants of Origin.  And on top of that they have to use vegetable oils, so are prone to crop inflation.  Right now they are valued at $25 which according to their data puts them at a 14x multiple of their future EBITDA and a 15% discount rate.  The same comparison would put Origin up over $40 a share today.

Origin is primed to cash in on the current boom in ESG focus.  Their current projects look to **double** in EBITDA when forecasting for the potential of carbon capture premiums and other environmental opportunities.  They can also license their technology to other companies since there is a huge market which one company can never fill.  When looking at the demand, they have already gotten $1bln in offtake commitments - and while they could have more - they have chosen to reserve capacity for higher margin items. 

On top of all that, Origin now has partnerships with Nestle, Danone, and Pepsico who are some of the largest plastic users in the world.  Match that with their connections from their board, they have the chops to make this work and scale.  And to go along with that, the merger (with warrants) will provide them with enough funding to get to their EBITDA positive timeframe with another $250mln in buffer.  So there is very little risk of dilution via share issuance.

Beyond their factories, they are also looking at licensing hte technology for another revenue stream to further accelerate growth (none of my calculations take this into account).  The potential for additional revenue is just absolutely massive since there is a $1 ***TRILLION*** addressable market opportunity.  Once in a lifetime opportunity.

## Competitors

Origin doesn’t have any direct competitors, but it does have some analogs.  PureCycle is one, but their focus is on biodegradable plastics.  They use canola oil as their feedstock so their price is tied to the price of the commodity - and even at relatively low costs today they still cost $1/lb vs $0.29/lb for Origin.  Also, there are a ton of products that **shouldn’t be biodegradable** - car parts for example shouldn’t be degrading!  Danimer Scientific is another analogue, but has the same issues as Purecycle.  

In the end, there is **no other company that is looking to make carbon negative plastics**.  

## Elephant in the Room

Plastics are an environmental problem.  There are microplastics that are increasing in concentration in the ocean and in ocean life specifically and they have become a disease on the planet.  Why am I okay with this personally for Origin?  Well simply, it is a step in the right direction.  There are a large number of applications which require non-biodegradability but ultimately this begins to get market penetration with **zero modification** for carbon reduction.  It’s a trade off for sure, but it’s only the start.

Things start to look much better with [net zero fuel pellets](https://investors.originmaterials.com/static-files/5ca7896d-4270-43df-bac4-7c20a353443e)  and water filters, carbon black, and agricultural applications which (aside from the fuel) are all carbon negative.  In the end, this is an insanely huge step towards reducing our carbon footprint and right now that takes priority for me



## Risks

They currently have no revenue and are building their first plant, Origin 1.  This plant is still just a testing plant and they are quite far away from revenue positive.  The plant was also delayed a year, likely due to COVID, but they now have the equipment on site.  Right now the price is trading between $8-9, and has a ways to go before it hits $11.50 and beyond - and it absolutely needs to hit that in order to remain financially healthy through the finished construction of Origin 2.  Additionally, Origin 2 could have delays and complications with its site choice along with the possibility of cost overruns due to inflation, etc.  

## Overall

There is a huge push for countries and companies to reduce their carbon footprint, and this company is set to not only make a very profitable and sustainable product - but to also capture a shitton of carbon doing it.  In the long run this company is likely going to explode in value as they have the talent, experience, and in demand product.  

There are real risks here, but the upside is **enormous** as this is a true potential unicorn.  I’m looking at a potential return of 10-30x over the next 10 years with a short term (next 2 years) return of 5-6x.  If Origin 1 gets online at the end of next year as planned, look for this stock to really take off!

Questions is: 
- Do I sell all of my stocks, then take out the profit ( for instance MSFT sell all, take 20% off the table) , and reinvest? Is that the normal way? 
- how do you only take out the profit, leaving the rest in? Is that possible?

stocks,"OPEC holding off increasing supply The dispute between UAE and the rest of OPEC has come to a halt with both sides failing to meet an agreement. I think this is a great short term catalyst to the oil trade. The futures for Brent and WTI are near their yearly highs and I see this sticking for the near term. 

Tuesday we may see a rally in oil companies and stocks as the price of oil doesn't seem to have much reason to come down, other than the unlikely scenario of a price war between the countries in OPEC. I do not feel like this will happen. 

Before the long weekend I sold my July 16 Exxon calls. Probably shouldn't have, but I took my profits and put them into January Halliburton and SLB calls. Hopefully I didn't bite myself in the ass, given the news, I bet my itm Exxon calls would've done well tomorrow, although they were 10 dte. I erred on the side of caution with that call, fearing theta would take majority of my gains. 

I doubt we will see energy dip tomorrow and I expect american companies to see modest gains actually, since OPEC doesn't seem to be raising supply at this surge in demand. If energy does decide to dip into tomorrow, I will be a buyer. 

The OIH should see good gains in this news, as well as the XLE. The companies I am choosing to play this with are Exxon, Devon, Suncor, Halliburton, and Schlumberger. I have shares of Exxon, and 6 month calls on everything else. I am very overweight this trade. 

I still believe there will be room to run on this trade and I think we may see peak prices in December, when many are going to travel for the winter. The other catalyst being Europe's reopening, which is still relatively early, catching steam and putting the oil market on fire. 

I wasn't a big believer in $100 a barrel, and I plan to exit my side of the trade before the price gets there, but I see it as more of an upside risk now due to the latest OPEC news. 

Good luck oil bulls, so far, everything is going as planned and better!"

4. FB- Instagram is a great platform for e-commerce, Facebook shopping is growing, Oculus is the best VR company and is still in early innings 
5. TSLA- Controversial but there’s a lot to like in their diversification with green industries like EVs, solar, batteries, Musk is hard to bet against 
6. BABA- incredible value for its growth, e-commerce, cloud, and health should create a stable growth for decades  
7. NVDA- The essential AI chip company, Huang is routinely ranked a top CEO, if passed the ARM acquisition is huge, best machine learning talent in the world outside of Google
8. PYPL- Digital payments are the furure and they own 2 of the 3 largest companies in the industry (PayPal and Venmo)

12. JD- E-commerce, Health, Cloud, AI growing revenue at 30-40% at a PE under 30

stocks,"Starbucks (SBUX): Solid or Shaky? SBUX was one of the first stocks I ever bought, but as a total n00b, I didn't understand all the fundamentals at the beginning. When I realized that I'd bought a stock with an astronomically high P/E ratio, I re-evaluated it and thought of selling, but then noticed that it was showing steady growth at the time and chose to hold it.

A few months later, I'm still holding it, but I've never stopped contemplating whether or not it would be better to sell it while it's turning a small profit. On one hand, it's one of the most recognizable companies in the world and has dominated its specific market for decades (similar to Coca-Cola or Nike), so it's one of those stocks that might be a good candidate as a ""forever"" (note the quotes) hold. On the other hand, has it already hit its peak? Can it still grow significantly when it's seemingly already everywhere it can be?

How dependable is a stock that beat its last three earnings reports and still took a tumble each time?"

stocks,"Intel (INTC) stock prospects: are you bullish or bearish? I bought INTC when I first started investing a few months ago when it was trading at $67, but looking back, I probably did so on past reputation instead of current situation (this was when I just learned how to research stocks, so I only looked at a few simple numbers like P/E ratio).

I know the company right now isn't in the best of shape, having squandered its position atop the semiconductor totem pole, and while it's easy to kick it when it's down, is there anyone who truly believes that it can turn around and gain back what it's lost? Sure, it may take a year or more (barring a miracle), but we've seen AMD give Intel a run for its money before (though never to *this* degree), and Intel managed to recover. Plus, the current CEO looks like a huge upgrade over the last guy; not only is he an engineer, but he'd been with the company decades ago when it was just starting to become the behemoth it would eventually be.

There's NOTHING I've been able to find in terms of educating myself since I received stock in a company when it when public back in 2014. From my understanding, I borrowed against the margin instead of selling off shares.

I barely manage to spread out my 401K and other retirement in different areas, I fully recognize that I should have just sold off the shares and be done. Well, the stock value plummeted in early 2019, a few months after my mother passed. Caretaking for her while she was in hospice took up the majority of my time, energy, and mental faculties.

I now have a balance of 30 shares (a recent merger had the overall number split).

All I am now trying to do is figure out the best was to satisfy a negative Margin Balance that at today's value is -$130.06. I understand there's interest being charged. I have made deposits to the account from my savings multiple times in an attempt to satisfy, but it's still showing a negative balance through my TD Ameritrade account

I even had a family friend get lung cancer from smoking, thankfully he survived through Merck's immunology drug keytruda (MRK) that I also own shares in but that didn't stop him from smoking. 

From this, I know how addicting it is and that demand for the product won't stop despite continual regulations against it. Even though it gets heavily taxed, the company increase their prices to keep margins high and people still buy it and this won't stop.

I understand that I am investing in an industry that fundamentally kills it's consumer, which is probably a stupid idea but despite this, demand continually increases.

Now let’s look a Q1 2021 which was reported on June 29th. Revenue of $33 million (which beat the entire year of 2020) and eps of $0.19! The reason for the huge earnings growth of 567% yoy is that Q1 we had income included from the many recent acquisitions ( 3weeks worth).
Looking forward to Q2, this explosive growth is going to get better, and I mean much better. Guidance from management is revenue of $147.6 million and gross profit of $26.7, Adjusted EBITDA of $10.3 million or $1.03eps. FOR 1 QUARTER! 
The Market Cap for this company is Stupid! $147.78 million as of Friday. 
This cannot last at this low valuation, our revenue for 1 Quarter will come in equal to our entire MC. 
Short sellers have owned this stock due to the share structure! The public float is roughly 6million and 40% of float is owned by insiders. Total float around 10 million.

1. To bring some awareness to this small company.
2. To see if someone has a bear case against them.

stocks,"Just showing off a bit So, just a bit of context, I've been doing research on how to invest in the stock market for the past six years. I've learned a great deal during my journey, which started on this very forum. To parse the incredible amount of data that's available, I've had to learn programing and (re-learn) data science. 

The end result of my efforts (so far) is a fully modular stock screener. It's able to pick and choose numbers from financial reports (balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow) and not only generate ratios, but as well as trends across time, and compare these companies to their peers. 

There are three limitations to this screener: the first is that the company must have four years of financial information available, so for example, the fan-favorite PLTR is not available. This is kind of by design, because established companies generally safer. The second limitation is that only fundamentals data is included, and price data + options data isn't. That will be addressed in the second part of my project, which deals mainly with risk management (ie: position sizing and diversification). The third limitation is that it's only limited to companies listed on the NASDAQ.

Here's an example output below: 

https://imgur.com/a/vu5GQ2N

The first column is the slope of the trend in revenue (flat) over four years (in thousand/day), and the second column is the slope of the trend in net income (flat) over four years (in thousand/day), sorted by the first column. The stocks included in this search are the top 100 technological service companies by market cap. 

Why am I showing off? Well, the first part is a little affirmation for my work. The second part is beta testing. If there are any industry leaders you'd like for me to look and compare fundamentals for, just provide the company and fundamentals and I'll see what I can do. 

I hope this post doesn't count as self promotion, as I'm not looking to monetize this in any way shape or form, now and in the future. It's mostly for myself so that I can reduce the amount of research done, and as a programming exercise. 

Setting everything up cost me no money, so once I'm done with the complete portfolio management system, I'll deploy it for free along with a white paper showing which metrics best describe the price."

stocks,"Strategies for finding value stocks the premise is finding companies that are undervalued/discounted.  A lot of times companies that are maybe in danger of bankruptcy or trending out of style, while obviously the most risky, have the most potential to turn around and pick back up.  Its that company that looks like things aren't working out on the surface, but you do some research, really dig deep through all the numbers and determine that you know what, I think this company can make it another 5 years. Everything seems stable, and the stock market is overreacting a bit.

So thats the premise of value investing. Find the discounted stocks. My question is how does one even go about looking for them? Is there an easy way to find a list of companies that have low share price or market cap? Like how can I be efficient at finding companies to analyze that are worth the time? One idea I had was to look at some small cap &amp; Micro cap ETFs and value/growth ETFs. Then you could kind of look through what holdings they have, look at some of the companies in closer detail and maybe use that as a way to find these companies. I'm not talking about investing in ETF but using them as a list of their holdings to find stocks to analyze.  
I think doing a valuation on a company is one thing, but you also have to find the companies worth evaluated and do so efficiently. So far this is the best idea I've been able to come up with for how to find value stocks to analyze.

I'm fairly confident that Jerome Powell is an expert at all this stuff and must be one if the most capable, if not most capable, person doing his job.

So when the FED starts ""tapering"" are we going to correct or crash?  

Some say the Fed has already begun tapering?

Do you honestly think that the market will sell off 50% or more?  I myself don't think that is realistic or that the Fed would even let it happen?

I'm obviously no market expert or economist, as I'm sure you can readily tell lol, but I think if we correct it would be more in the 10 to at most 15% range?

stocks,"Please poke as many holes as you possibly can in my thesis Hi guys,

Recently I've been bullish on Rite Aid - perhaps foolishly so. I've spent sometime putting this thesis together so I want you to poke as many holes as you possibly can in it. I'm not looking for confirmation bias, I'm looking for someone to challenge me to help me catch my blindspots. 

&amp;#x200B;

* Rite Aid generates more annual revenues than all of McDonald's! (This trivia alone could probably win you some bar bets!).
* Rite Aid's Market Cap is $878 MILLION compared to McDonald's $173 BILLION. 
* Rite Aid is the 3rd largest pharmacy chain in the US and currently has +2500 stores. 
   * How much those +2500 stores are worth? we don't know, but Walgreens bought 1900 stores from Rite Aid for $4.4B in 2019. (Rite Aid used to have +4000 stores then)
* Rite Aid's Market cap is ($878M) compared with CVS ($108B) &amp; Walgreens ($41B)
* Rite Aid owns Thrifty Ice cream brand, and they paid $2B to acquire Elixir (pharmacy benefit management). The PBM market is +400B market and growing.
* Rite Aid is undergoing a transformation as we speak, they launched a new strategy a year ago which is focusing on (Becoming the dominant midmarket PBM, Revitalizing the retail and digital experience, and unlocking the value of the pharmacists)
* When Amazon hinted that they want to enter the brick &amp; mortar pharmacy business, Motley Fool did a piece a month ago where expected Rite Aid to be bought by Amazon (Don't forget Rite Aid is the #1 pharmacy in Seattle, and Amazon's HQ is there)
* I'm personally not a 'short squeeze guy', I think it is a rare occurrence, but for the record Rite Aid has 54M outstanding shares, around 61% of those are owned by institutions, 2% by insiders, the rest (20M shares) by retail. 9M shares are shorted. So basically about 45% of retail shares are shorted. Rite Aid has that 'nostalgia' and 'retail' feel that GME has.
* Remember that Rite Aid trades in a very basic and essential commodity (Food &amp; Drugs)

&amp;#x200B;

Now that you've reached to this line, you may ask yourself, where is the but? Why Rite Aid is trading so cheaply.Well, don't worry, I got you!Rite Aid's debt is considered very high

* Rite Aid is having a difficult time turning in profit (-$13M last quarter) (Although I may say, the adjusted EPS was positive)
* Rite Aid's Opex &amp; SGA has been increasing
* All of the factors above is affecting the cashflow
* The CEO seems to be an idiot, she keeps providing negative FY outlooks which is affecting the SP even lower. This happened in the last 2 quarters (June &amp; March). Somehow I think she's sandbagging.
* With all that being said, there are key metrics that are improving, the EPS has improved the last 2 quarters (hopefully next quarter they turn in profit)
* Rite Aid has been restructuring their debt and there is not a single LT debt that is due until 2023! 
* the revenues has been growing in the last 4 years (last quarter they reported 2.2% YoY growth).

Now ask yourself, is $RAD worth the risk? It is up to you. I personally think it is just a matter of time before someone competent can figure out how to turn in major profit out of $24+ Billions in revenues. and I'm having a hard time believing that a company that has +2500 pharmacy and a PBM system along with an ice cream brand is valued at $890M only. 

Let me know what you think please!

* The third reply is saying to get professional advice from a financial advisor and they end telling how successful they've been
* Fourth reply asking for the third commenters financial advisor
* The fifth reply is ""third reply guy"" telling them the name of the advisor and to go to their website

stocks,"I read a macro paper about a 50-year market-beating strategy. Here’s my layman’s summary and analysis. Hey guys - been doing a lot of reading recently and figured I should share some of the cooler stuff with the community. I whipped this up quickly but can do a more in-depth dive for this and other papers if there turns out to be interest. The paper is called [A Half Century of Macro Momentum](https://www.aqr.com/-/media/AQR/Documents/Insights/White-Papers/A-Half-Century-of-Macro-Momentum.pdf) by Jordan Brooks of AQR Capital. They’re a quant fund that runs a number of successful strategies. Nothing I say here is investment advice by the way, and I do recommend checking out the paper if interested.

**- - - Executive Summary (given in paper)**

*I outline a systematic and diversified approach to global macro investing grounded in economic theory, and detail its performance over the last half century. The analysis shows that the strategy has the potential to deliver strong positive returns, low correlation to traditional asset classes across various macroeconomic environments, and to provide diversification in bear equity markets and rising real yield environments. This systematic global macro strategy appears to be a complement to other alternative risk premia — such as trend-following and long-short value, momentum, and carry strategies — and does not appear to be fully exploited by existing global macro managers.*

**- - - My Summary (in layman’s terms)**

Global macro is a type of investing that involves looking at macroeconomic factors, well, globally. These factors include stuff like unemployment, business cycles, interest rates, international trade, and monetary policy (actions of the Fed and central banks around the world). Global macro investors make predictions based on studying these factors to figure out their outlook for the economy, and invest accordingly. This means their investment universe is much larger than just stocks. They look at long-term government bonds, currencies, and interest rate-affected assets (like short term bonds).

Momentum trading is a strategy that typically involves looking at trends in stock prices and assuming that those trends will keep on going for a short period. For example, if there is upward momentum on a stock, momentum traders want to get in now while it’s still going up. Clearly, this is usually a short-term trading strategy.

In a nutshell, macro momentum is a macro investing strategy that pulls from momentum strategies. Instead of looking at price trends, it looks at macroeconomic trends. It goes long (buys) assets that have positive macroeconomic indicators (explained below) and short (sells) if vice versa. The four asset types this strategy looks at are stocks, currencies, long-term government bonds, and short-term bonds (the paper calls this “global interest rates”). The four macroeconomic indicators this strategy looks at are business cycles (generally, how is the economy doing), monetary policy (what is the Fed doing, is it conservative or aggressive), international trade, and risk sentiment (are stocks going up or down).

[Exhibit 1: Summary of Macro Momentum Indicators](https://i.imgur.com/x1nJJcF.png)

Let’s talk through how I think about this, starting with the column “Increasing Growth.” If the economy is doing well, people have money, so they invest their money into stocks, making the outlook good for stocks. Stocks usually give more of a return than bonds, so their demand goes down, as does their price, making the outlook worse for longer term and shorter term bonds — I’m aware this isn’t the full picture but it’s how I think about it, bond folks please chip in if you’d like to add anything here. Growth is good for currencies as it is accompanied by more business and foreign investment, meaning more demand for the currency - the paper talks about the Balassa-Samuelson hypothesis here, which pretty much says countries with high productivity and therefore prices for tradable goods have higher prices for services too (developed countries vs. developing countries).

Moving to int’l trade, this is captured by looking at whether the currency is depreciating (getting weaker, purchasing power decreasing) on a 1-year basis. Depreciating currency is good for stocks (because our currency is weaker compared to int’l currencies, our goods are relatively cheaper and there’s more demand for them and the companies that sell them), bad for currencies (similar idea to momentum, if currencies have been depreciating, we expect them to continue), and bad for bonds and interest rates. For this last bit, here’s how I think about it — if my currency is depreciating and getting weaker than other currencies, global investors don’t want to be holding it (effectively, its “price” is decreasing). Something that makes a currency attractive is a high interest rate, so parking your money in that currency earns you interest, so a weakening currency’s central bank has less incentive to decrease rates. The price of bonds and other interest rate products increases as rates decrease, meaning this environment/scenario is overall negative for bonds.

Monetary policy, captured by looking at 1-year changes in the yield curve - this is where the x axis is the term of the bond and the y axis is the interest rate paid, it’s usually upward sloping in a good economy and downward in a bad one. If the Fed gets tighter (money printer out of ink), this is bad for stocks and bonds because there’s not as much money to go into these; and it’s good for currencies because it decreases the money supply and increases interest rates (more int’l investment into our currency).

Finally, the risk sentiment is captured by looking at 1-year stock market returns. Increasing risk sentiment is when the stock market has strong returns. This is good for stocks (momentum) and currencies (int’l investment into our stocks), and bad for bonds (who wants to invest in bonds when stocks are doing so well).

**- - - Creating a Macro Momentum Portfolio**

With this in mind, we now want to create our macro momentum portfolio. This will consist of a long-short portfolio (LS) and a directional portfolio (D) for each combo of indicators and assets. So there’s four indicators times four asset types times two types of portfolios meaning we’ll have 32 “sub” portfolios total that we’ll then combine into the final macro momentum portfolio.

LS — these are market neutral. This portfolio takes a long position in assets with favorable trends (above the average) and short for the assets with unfavorable trends (below the average). Because we’re doing all this with the average in mind, there’s a theoretical neutral exposure to the market, meaning this should perform despite market movements.

D — these take long positions in assets with favorable trends and shorts in assets with unfavorable trends, meaning there’s no computation of an average, and the portfolio can be long or short-exposed.

So we have a LS portfolio for stocks using the economic growth (business cycle) indicator, a D portfolio for the same, an LS for stocks using int’l trade as an indicator, a D portfolio for the same, etc. Once we have the 32 total, he aggregate macro momentum portfolio is created by taking an equal weight across all 32 asset-indicator portfolios.

It’s easy to get lost in the specifics here, so I’ll repeat what we’re doing from a bird’s eye view again. We’re looking at 4 macroeconomic indicators from generally the past year, applying those indicators to 4 asset classes to make a table like the above, and then pretty much using those indicators to predict how the asset classes will perform over the next year. Rebalanced annually.

**- - - Performance**

This portfolio was tested from Jan 1970 to Dec 2016. That means it’s seen the bear markets of 1987, 2000, and 2008, but not 2020. It’s also seen recessions, wars, stagflation, and disinflation. Here are the results in a table:

[Exhibit 3: Macro Momentum Strategy Performance since 1970](https://i.imgur.com/bbeBBzU.png)

Let’s unpack this. Looks like a consistently market-beating strategy that is un-correlated with the stock and bond markets. One question you might have is, “if this is so good, why doesn’t AQR just invest fully in it?“ The best answer here is probably liquidity — as a fund with \~$150B in assets, it’s impossible to employ your capital all in one strategy without affecting prices enough that you’d no longer be beating markets. Also, AQR’s only been around since 1998, and although I’m sure they had this research in some way or another before the paper was published, it did just come out in 2017.

The table shows a CAGR for the strat (without accounting for inflation) of 13%, compared to [8.41% for the S&amp;P](http://www.moneychimp.com/features/market_cagr.htm). It beats its composite assets' returns in rising yield and falling yield markets, in bull runs and bear markets (on average), and has a higher Sharpe Ratio than the S&amp;P for the period (1.2 vs. around 1.0). It’s non-correlated with bonds and has something of a negative correlation with stocks. Does the latter number mean it goes down when stocks go up, meaning it’s gone down for the majority of the period. No. The paper calls the returns of the strategy a “smile” compared to stock returns. Here’s a graph.

[Exhibit 2: Quarterly Returns, 1970-2016](https://i.imgur.com/ZQO1o8p.png)

When stocks are up, this portfolio is up a bit too (that's called a slightly positive beta). When stocks are down, this portfolio is up a whole lot (a very negative beta). On average, the portfolio has a slightly negative beta compared to stocks, as mentioned earlier.

Well mostly just options trading,  I am by far not an expert and many others far more knowledgeable as I am fairly new to options trading but I want to share some of my early experiences that I have encountered just to give some context of how things can and probably will go wrong.

Decided to sell cash secured puts on NIO stock just before the February crash,  I’m just good like that. At a 50$ strike of course I got assigned which isn’t a big deal in and of itself but shares fell to 31 a share and I couldn’t buy any because I was severely underwater on my new acquisition.  Wanted to sell CC but CC at 50$ strike were basically not worth it because the stock could breakout at any time.  If I had just kept cash on hand and bought the dip I’d be up 60% percent already vs just broke even.  

Bought calls on Palantir during the same crash figuring it was probably a sure thing well 350 options were worth 50$ when I sold them close to expiry.

stocks,"Massive Ransomware attack before holiday leaves companies across at least 17 countries scrambling https://apnews.com/article/ransomware-cyberattack-2e6d26361568b2f1232bd59e28ed61bb

Businesses around the world rushed Saturday to contain a ransomware attack that has paralyzed their computer networks, a situation complicated in the U.S. by offices lightly staffed at the start of the Fourth of July holiday weekend. It’s not yet known how many organizations have been hit by demands that they pay a ransom in order to get their systems working again. But some cybersecurity researchers predict the attack targeting customers of software supplier Kaseya could be one of the broadest ransomware attacks on record. It follows a scourge of headline-grabbing attacks over recent months that have been a source of diplomatic tension between U.S. President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin over whether Russia has become a safe haven for cybercriminal gangs.

Biden said Saturday he didn’t yet know for certain who was responsible but suggested that the U.S. would respond if Russia was found to have anything to do with it. “If it is either with the knowledge of and or a consequence of Russia then I told Putin we will respond,” Biden said. “We’re not certain. The initial thinking was it was not the Russian government.” Cybersecurity experts say the REvil gang, a major Russian-speaking ransomware syndicate, appears to be behind the attack that targeted the software company Kaseya, using its network-management package as a conduit to spread the ransomware through cloud-service providers. “The number of victims here is already over a thousand and will likely reach into the tens of thousands,” said cybersecurity expert Dmitri Alperovitch of the Silverado Policy Accelerator think tank. “No other ransomware campaign comes even close in terms of impact.”

The cybersecurity firm ESET says there are victims in least 17 countries, including the United Kingdom, South Africa, Canada, Argentina, Mexico, Kenya and Germany. In Sweden, most of the grocery chain Coop’s 800 stores were unable to open because their cash registers weren’t working, according to SVT, the country’s public broadcaster. The Swedish State Railways and a major local pharmacy chain were also affected. Kaseya CEO Fred Voccola said in a statement that the company believes it has identified the source of the vulnerability and will “release that patch as quickly as possible to get our customers back up and running.”

Voccola said fewer than 40 of Kaseya’s customers were known to be affected, but experts said the ransomware could still be affecting hundreds more companies that rely on Kaseya’s clients that provide broader IT services. John Hammond of the security firm Huntress Labs said he was aware of a number of managed-services providers — companies that host IT infrastructure for multiple customers — being hit by the ransomware, which encrypts networks until the victims pay off attackers. “It’s reasonable to think this could potentially be impacting thousands of small businesses,” said Hammond, basing his estimate on the service providers reaching out to his company for assistance and comments on Reddit showing how others are responding.

At least some victims appeared to be getting ransoms set at $45,000, considered a small demand but one that could quickly add up when sought from thousands of victims, said Brett Callow, a ransomware expert at the cybersecurity firm Emsisoft.

Callow said it’s not uncommon for sophisticated ransomware gangs to perform an audit after stealing a victim’s financial records to see what they can really pay, but that won’t be possible when there are so many victims to negotiate with. “They just pitched the demand amount at a level most companies will be willing to pay,” he said. Voccola said the problem is only affecting its “on-premise” customers, which means organizations running their own data centers. It’s not affecting its cloud-based services running software for customers, though Kaseya also shut down those servers as a precaution, he said. The company added in a statement Saturday that “customers who experienced ransomware and receive a communication from the attackers should not click on any links -- they may be weaponized.”

Gartner analyst Katell Thielemann said it’s clear that Kaseya quickly sprang to action, but it’s less clear whether their affected clients had the same level of preparedness. “They reacted with an abundance of caution,” she said. “But the reality of this event is it was architected for maximum impact, combining a supply chain attack with a ransomware attack.” Supply chain attacks are those that typically infiltrate widely used software and spread malware as it updates automatically. Complicating the response is that it happened at the start of a major holiday weekend in the U.S., when most corporate IT teams aren’t fully staffed. That could also leave those organizations unable to address other security vulnerabilities, such a dangerous Microsoft bug affecting software for print jobs, said James Shank, of threat intelligence firm Team Cymru.

“Customers of Kaseya are in the worst possible situation,” he said. “They’re racing against time to get the updates out on other critical bugs.” Shank said “it’s reasonable to think that the timing was planned” by hackers for the holiday. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce said it was affecting hundreds of businesses and was “another reminder that the U.S. government must take the fight to these foreign cybercriminal syndicates” by investigating, disrupting and prosecuting them.

The federal Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency said in a statement that it is closely monitoring the situation and working with the FBI to collect more information about its impact. CISA urged anyone who might be affected to “follow Kaseya’s guidance to shut down VSA servers immediately.” Kaseya runs what’s called a virtual system administrator, or VSA, that’s used to remotely manage and monitor a customer’s network. The privately held Kaseya is based in Dublin, Ireland, with a U.S. headquarters in Miami.

REvil, the group most experts have tied to the attack, was the same ransomware provider that the FBI linked to an attack on JBS SA, a major global meat processor forced to pay a $11 million ransom, amid the Memorial Day holiday weekend in May. Active since April 2019, the group provides ransomware-as-a-service, meaning it develops the network-paralyzing software and leases it to so-called affiliates who infect targets and earn the lion’s share of ransoms. U.S. officials have said the most potent ransomware gangs are based in Russia and allied states and operate with Kremlin tolerance and sometimes collude with Russian security services. Alperovitch said he believes the latest attack is financially motivated and not Kremlin-directed."

I did that with a meme stock back in February and it backfired. However, I thought about selling my shares of a few other stocks I’m less confident in that are in my portfolio to add to my position of this stock.

Long story short, I am looking to dump a small chunk of money on a stock I currently own, B.FLY Net.Work (spelled this way because I’m not sure if we’re allowed to say the real name on here). I would be averaging down and I also believe this stock will perform well in the long-term. I won’t need the money right away and wasn’t sure if this was a smart move. I figured since I’m young it should be fine to risk it. I have other stocks that I don’t plan on selling (SE, MSFT, AAPL, etc.) It would be a huge percentage of my portfolio which I’ve heard and learned the hard way not to make newer growth stocks a big part of your investments, however as I’ve said I believe in it in the long-term. Does anyone have any experience with doing something like this? Or is this a flat out bad idea? I planned on selling my position in N.NDM and adding to it that way, along with a few other less confident stocks. I’d basically be getting rid of my other speculative stocks that I feel I should’ve never invested in in the first place since it’ll take awhile to break even on those anyways, if it ever happens at all, to put on B.FLY.

stocks,"$BODY - Bear case discussion Before I get downvoted by the bulls, I am a current shareholder of $BODY stock and plan to be for many years. I have purchased Beachbody products twice, and will likely again in the future. There has been DD highlighting the bull cases for investing in $BODY, but I haven’t seen the bear cases acknowledged. There are two sides, and I think it’s important to discuss both. Here are my thoughts on the common bear arguments I’ve seen. Let me know what I’m missing. (TL/DR summary at bottom)

1. Subscriber base will decrease as people go back to gyms instead.

For the three months ended March 31, 2021 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2020 They have a [95.8% month over month digital retention.](https://investors.thebeachbodycompany.com/news/news-details/2021/Forest-Road-Acquisition-Corp.-and-The-Beachbody-Company-Announce-Combined-First-Quarter-2021-Financial-Results-for-Beachbody-and-Myx/default.aspx)

COVID forced people to exercise at home for the first time. Many had no idea how time and cost efficient this is with minimal hassle and equipment needed.  Now they know. Also, I believe the newfound freedom and flexibility of people who continue to work from home reinforces the argument for at home exercising. Can’t slip in a midday workout if your at the office. 

Some people don’t enjoy exercising at home due to space, preferred equipment, distraction, etc, or they enjoy the gym atmosphere, or a change in environment. These people will return to the gym.  Some may stream Beachbody content at the gym rather than use a personal trainer or dietician.  For only $8.25 more per month, they can access Beachbody’s excellent content AND nutrition plans. 

In addition to Beachbody merging with Myx Fitness (the at-home connected fitness bike manufacturer), they ALSO merged with Openfit, which is now available at some gyms. [LA Fitness, Esporta Fitness and City Sports Club members can add Openfit to their membership for $5/month.](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/fitness-international-to-provide-its-members-with-openfit-the-all-in-one-digital-fitness-nutrition-and-wellness-platform-301277399.html)  I would not be surprised if more gyms partner with Beachbody in the future. Again, their content is excellent. 



2. It’s an MLM business.  MLMs are evil and a scam.

Beachbody has an MLM component. The coaches. They refer to coaches as a “network of independent contractors”. In my opinion, they’re just playing with semantics by calling it that instead of an MLM. 

Here’s the scoop. [Coach info on website](https://faq.beachbody.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/4313/~/review-of-the-team-beachbody-coach-business-opportunity)
&gt; “People can sign up to be a Coach online for a one-time $39.95 sign-up fee plus a $15.95 recurring monthly fee-this covers ongoing access to their website, training, reporting, and personal development content, plus all the back-end operations of warehousing and shipping products to their customers from Beachbody.”

On the positive side, their model seems better than other MLMs (if that’s a thing). 
&gt; “Coaches earn commissions from sales of Beachbody fitness and nutrition products (like Shakeology) plus a lot of hard work, not from recruiting fees or business fees. **Coaches are never required to buy or hold inventory of product**. Coaches must sell products themselves. **They don't just make money off of the product sales of Coaches underneath them.**”

Carl’s reasoning for having coaches is to reward people who have achieved life changing results from Beachbody products and want to help others to achieve their health goals as well.  Some people have found success being a coach, others have not and are disgruntled with the company because of this. 

Do I like the MLM aspect? No.
Is it a deal breaker for me? No. Here’s why:

- **You don’t need to interact with coaches or become one to purchase Beachbody products.** The coaches are just one avenue they use to sell &amp; advertise. It is not the business as a whole.

- The coaches are classified as independent contractors, just like Uber and Lyft drivers.  However, Beachbody can function as a company without them, unlike Uber and Lyft.  And I don’t see institutional buyers running away from those companies.

- Other businesses use MLMs and are profitable and successful. Examples: 
&gt; LULU (Lululemon): 2.46B gross profit, $368/share, 49.88B market cap, 87% held by institutions
&gt; HLF (Herbalife): 4.39B gross profit, $53.17/share, 5.74B market cap, 82% held by institutions
(*numbers taken from yahoo finance on 7/2/21*)

- The MLM component is clearly profitable for them, otherwise they would have dropped it.  I want to invest in profitable businesses, especially if I like their products (which I do).


TL/DR
Bear Cases:
**Subscriber base will decrease as people go back to gyms.**
Rebuttal:
- [95.8% month over month digital retention.](https://investors.thebeachbodycompany.com/news/news-details/2021/Forest-Road-Acquisition-Corp.-and-The-Beachbody-Company-Announce-Combined-First-Quarter-2021-Financial-Results-for-Beachbody-and-Myx/default.aspx)
- Gym goers will still use streaming services.
- [LA Fitness, Esporta Fitness and City Sports Club members can add Openfit (part of $BODY) to their membership for $5/month.](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/fitness-international-to-provide-its-members-with-openfit-the-all-in-one-digital-fitness-nutrition-and-wellness-platform-301277399.html) 

**It’s an MLM business. MLMs are evil and a scam.**
Rebuttal:
- There is an MLM component, but it’s not the business as a whole. **You don’t need to interact with coaches or become one to purchase Beachbody products.**
- Other publicly traded companies rely on independent contractors ($BODY has them but doesn’t rely on them) or have MLM aspects and are successful with large % of institutional holdings.
- It is profitable. If $BODY makes money, I make money."
stocks,"RYLD recovery time This is a question for anyone who has been holding RYLD for a significant amount of time. I'm curious about how long it takes the ETF to recover from a sizeable correction or drop in the Russell 2K index.

Let’s say I myself had 50k and would accept family and friends to pass me a couple thousand they wouldn’t know what to do with. Let’s say 5k from a relative. 

So now I have $55k. $(5/50)K is 10%. Out of fairness since that $5k is now been absorbed into my portfolio which is 10% of the whole balance. They’d be entitled to 10% gross but there’d be taxes and fees (as a Canadian there are broker fees) and of course I’d want to take a little commission for the work. 

There’s also a little consideration that let’s say before they added to my fund, maybe I had positions already it’s not like I just started it with cash not yet invested. What if I had invested in a stock that 10x way before I accepted an outside investor, would they be entitled to 7-9% of my position?

stocks,"What do you guys think about my strategy? I’ve only been investing in stocks for the last 6 months, I went through multiple strategies on virtual accounts and real accounts to see  if they are viable. 

My current strategy is pretty simple which is investing at current market price in Amazon, Google, Microsoft and Facebook, while keeping a trailing stop loss of -20% (meaning if it drops by -20% from its highest point, it will cash out). Reason I keep adding money no matter the market price is because in previous strategies I tried timing the market and ended up with more missed out profits than prevented losses, so I decided that on average, time in the market is better than timing the market. I don’t have any take profit point, and my exit strategy is based solely on the stop loss.

This is the email I received from DT in response to my email concerning today’s stock price drop from Brian Bartholomew
Senior Vice President, Capital Markets and Strategy

Hi David-
 
CRAZY day today, to be sure.  The Google policy-shift noise was the source of our weakness today…and was severely misinterpreted by investors today…
 
https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22557390/google-apk-app-bundles-package-format-play-store
 
 There are scarier, more (wrongfully-)opinionated versions of the same story floating around out there today, some of which seem to wish to imply that Google is working to effectively remove all other app install sources.  This is UNTRUE – we are fully onboard with Google in this “bundle” effort that is rooted in other, more logical incentives.  Most importantly, this has ZERO impact on our business (we fully applaud the movement to app bundles and support app bundles already as part of our platform).
 
There is NO way that our stock should be down on this noise.  
 
 Total madness today.  Speculation led to outright fear.  We fully support Google’s efforts in this area…just as they fully accept &amp; support our participation in the ecosystem.  Our business is just as fully healthy as it was yesterday…and will ideally continue to be going forward.
 
Have a safe &amp; sane (&amp; fun) weekend.

 I'm investing in the S&amp;P 500, but Vanguard doesn't allow fractional shares. If I put in £100 and the unit price is £51, £49 is then put into my account as 'cash'.

This is my first ever losing streak, and as much as I knew it could happen—especially for a new trader—it’s still hard to shake off. The amount lost isn’t what’s important here (my total lost is minuscule when compared to what a full-time trader may lose in just one trade); it’s the experience of it that I’m finding difficult to set aside, since this is the first time.

I’ve gone back already and reviewed all my trades. I know why I lost on each. What I’d like to ask you is what you normally do when hit with a losing streak to help you recover. If you’re experienced enough to simply brush it off, how long did it take you to conquer this psychological hurdle?"

But perhaps a consolidated list of funds (with summaries) that have been recommended to me, I've come across, or am invested personally in could be of some use to you:

**Vanguard (Fund / ETF)**

1. VTSAX / VTI - Total USA

3. VDADX / VIG - large, established companies that pay healthy dividends (tend to be older companies)
4. VTWAX / VT - total world, but keep in mind that global growth can be uneven and overall gains dampened
5. VEIRX - Equity / Income
6. VGSLX / VNQ - Real Estate
7. VFAIX / VFH - Financial

**Fidelity**

1. FSKAX - Total USA
2. FZROX - Total USA / Zero Fee Fund (fewer small-cap stocks compared to FSKAX)
3. FXAIX - 500 Index (bigger risk, bigger companies, more volatility)
4. FEQIX - Equity / Income
5. FSRNX - Real Estate
6. FSPSX - International (large-cap excluding USA + Canada)

# **Fed could be a surprise catalyst for the markets in holiday week - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/02/fed-could-be-a-surprise-catalyst-for-markets-in-holiday-week-.html)**
*****
&gt; The quiet holiday week ahead could hold some fireworks for investors if the Federal Reserve reveals its thinking on its bond buying program.
*****
&gt; The four-day trading week could see stocks drift, after hitting new highs this past week. The closely watched 10-year Treasury yield has held under 1.5%, a positive for tech which outperformed with a 3.2% gain for the week.
*****
&gt; There are very few economic reports of note, aside from ISM services data on Tuesday. But the Fed’s minutes from its last meeting will be released Wednesday afternoon, and there is potential for the market to learn more about the central bank’s behind-the-scenes discussions on winding down its quantitative easing program.
*****
&gt; “Our base case is that rates drift higher, but in order to that get that move higher you need a catalyst to get there,” said Brian Daingerfield, head of G10 FX strategy Americas at NatWest Markets. “Either the Fed has to move forward aggressively on tapering, or you have to get the data really rocking, and you don’t have either.”
*****
&gt; Friday’s report that 850,000 jobs were added in June was better than expected. However, the unemployment rate missed expectations after rising by 0.1 percentage points to 5.9%. Economists expected the rate to fall to 5.6%. The report was not seen as strong enough to encourage the Fed to step away sooner from its easy policies. It was, however, seen as a positive — yet largely incomplete — picture of the labor market.
*****
&gt; Daingerfield said there is the potential for the Fed’s June meeting minutes to surprise the market, similar to the way April minutes did.
*****
&gt; “Remember, Powell said they were not talking about talking about tapering,” he said, referring to Fed Chairman Jerome Powell’s comments right after the April meeting. “Remember, Powell was very dismissive, and then the minutes revealed a kind of drift to the committee.”
*****
&gt; The April meeting minutes did surprise investors when they noted that “a number of participants” said it would be appropriate to begin discussing tapering bond purchases at upcoming meetings if the economy continues to make rapid progress. After the June meeting, Powell revealed early stage discussions about paring back bond buying. The Fed also presented a new forecast that included two rate hikes in 2023, where there were none indicated before.
*****
&gt; The market is highly sensitive to details about the Fed’s bond purchase program since the ending to that measure would be open the door for the central bank to raise interest rates. The low-rate environment has been the kindling behind the stock market’s robust gains since the Fed went all out to help the economy get through the pandemic. Cutting back on the monthly $120 billion bond purchases would be the first rollback of those extraordinary measures.
*****
&gt; “There’s a lot we don’t know about the Fed’s thinking about tapering,” Daingerfield said. He said key information would be when it plans to start, how rapidly it will move to wind down the program and how it decides to break down its current monthly purchases of $80 billion in Treasurys and $40 billion in mortgage securities.
*****
&gt; “These details really do matter. Did they get into that conversation at all about details? The more detail they discussed, the more likely it is they are looking to move forward sooner,” Daingerfield said. Fed watchers widely expect more details about tapering the bond program around its annual symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming in late August, and then start slowing purchases later this year or early in 2022.
*****
&gt; For now, the positive tone in the bond market has helped stocks. The 10-year yield, which moves opposite price, has fallen from its high of the year of about 1.75%. At that level, technology and growth shares were under pressure.
*****
&gt; But they’ve been making a comeback as rates drift around in a range below 1.6%. The 10-year was at 1.43% Friday, and while the lower rate may help tech stocks, the yield level is a sharp contrast to an economy that was expected to grow at more than 10% in the second quarter.
*****
&gt; That pace is expected to slow, but growth for the year is expected to be robust at more than 7%.
*****
&gt; # Tech transition
&gt; Citi Private Bank chief investment strategist Steven Wieting said that, with the economy peaking, the time is right for investors to begin transitioning to tech and growth shares from the popular cyclical trade.
*****
&gt; “We’re seeing this as all a temporary period of massive distortions, and within a year from now, we’ll be on steadier water,” he said. “I think this is giving people a reason, including us, to move away from just cyclical rebound trades and into some sustainable growth opportunities.”
*****
&gt; Year to date, cyclicals have been some of the better performers. Energy shares are up 44.5% with the rebound in oil prices, and financials have bounced 25.2%. In contrast, S&amp;P 500 growth stocks are up 14.3%, lagging slightly the S&amp;P 500′s 15.5% gain. Tech stocks are up just 14.9% year-to-date.
*****
&gt; One area Wieting now likes is global health care. The S&amp;P 500 health care sector was up 12.5% for the year so far.
*****
&gt; “Health care is a mid-cycle outperformer. Health care is a part of the economy that didn’t fall as hard,” he said. “Earnings and revenues have grown moderately every year since the mid-1980s.” He said the sector has lagged the S&amp;P 500 since the end of 2019 by 10 percentage points, and has a cheap valuation. Big pharma stocks are among the best dividend payers.
*****
&gt; For the major sectors, on a 12-month basis, the cyclical sectors of industrials, materials, and energy have all risen more than 40%, and tech has had a similar 42% gain.
*****
&gt; “The growth stocks have stayed rich. The value stocks have completely caught up with growth stocks in 12-month performance, but the valuation hasn’t been beaten down in growth stocks,” he said. “Gradually we’re going to get more sustained performance out of tech after this period where it flatlined.”
*****
&gt; Wieting said one area that is particularly attractive is cybersecurity, where demand is strong as a “tech spending essential,” but the sector has gone nowhere.
*****
&gt; For instance, the iShares Cybersecurity and Tech ETF IHAK is just below its 52 week high set in January, and the Global X Cybersecurity ETF BUG is trading about a dollar below its February high.
*****
&gt; Wieting said he likes some alternative energy names and companies that are involved in digitization, including fintech.
*****
&gt; He expects the overall stock market to move higher but not at the same rapid clip.
*****
&gt; “We want to start transitioning portfolios away from just rebound plays...We’re transitioning, knowing we’ve captured significant outperformance over the past year with cyclical value. It made people comfortable investing in equities when we could show how cheap they were,” he said.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 ended the week up 1.7% at a record 4,352, while the Dow climbed 1% to 34,786. The Nasdaq was 1.9% higher, ending the week at a record 14,639.

&gt; # Typical July Seasonal Pattern: Bullish Through Mid-Month &amp; Tepid After

&gt; This July has commenced with across the board gains from the major indexes, DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000. Yesterday’s gains are consistent with historical trends for the first trading day of July. Over the past twenty-one years, July has on average begun with respectable gains. The second trading day has been weaker, but after this the major indexes have tended to trend solidly higher through mid-month to around the thirteenth trading day. At this point the major indexes have tended to weaken and trade sideways to lower to finish out the month.

&gt; # Sentiment Has Perked Up

&gt; Sentiment has taken a big step up in the past week. The AAII weekly sentiment survey saw 48.6% of respondents report as bullish this week, up 8.2 percentage points from last week for the highest reading since the week of April 22nd when over half of respondents reported as optimists. Not only is this week's reading ten percentage points above the historical average, but the one-week increase was the largest since an 11.1 percentage point jump during the week of April 8th. Similarly, the Investors Intelligence survey of newsletter writers saw bullish sentiment jump from 56.5% last week to an eight-week high of 59.6%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/07/070121-AAII-Bull.png)**

&gt; Considering bearish sentiment was already muted, that big increase in bullish sentiment was only met with a 1.1 percentage point decline in bearish sentiment. Only 22.2% of respondents reported as bearish this week, the lowest reading since June 10th.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/07/070121-AAII-Bear.png)**

&gt; While bearish sentiment did not experience a particularly large decline, it was an inverse move to bullish sentiment which resulted in the bull-bear spread climbing 9.3 points to the highest level since April 22nd. That means sentiment continues to largely favor the bulls. Prior to the past year, late 2017 and early 2018 was the only other period in recent years that the bull-bear spread was at similar levels to now.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/07/070121-AAII-Spread.png)**

&gt; Given the jump in bullish sentiment did not borrow from bearish sentiment, neutral sentiment took a significant hit this week falling 7.4 percentage points. That was both the biggest one-week decline and marks the lower level in neutral sentiment since April.

&gt; # Market Stronger Day Before than After Independence Day

&gt; Over the last 21 years, the trading day before Independence Day has been stronger than the day after. DJIA and S&amp;P 500 have advanced 66.7% of the time with average gains of 0.13% and 0.11% respectively on the day before. Based upon average performance, NASDAQ and Russell 2000 are slightly softer on the day before, but still lean bullish. On the trading day after Independence Day DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and Russell 2000 have declined more frequently than advanced. DJIA has recorded the fewest number of advances while Russell 2000 has the worst average performance with a 0.10% loss.

&gt; # Stocks Only Going Up In The First Half

&gt; One of the most remarkable aspects of the past six months has been the lack of a significant pullback. The S&amp;P 500 has not seen a 5% pullback since October, and since the start of the year, the most it had fallen from a high was 4.23% from mid-February to March 4th. Besides that and another smaller 4% pullback in May, it has been a one-way trip higher. Looking back through the history of the S&amp;P 500, there are not many other years in which the index went the entire first half without at least a 5% pullback. Below we show the chart of the S&amp;P 500 for each of the 14 years that, like this year, did not experience a pullback of at least 5% in the first half. . As shown, six of these (highlighted in green)—1954, 1958, 1964, 1993, 1995, and most recently 2017—actually did not see a 5% or larger pullback in the second half of the year either.

&gt; As for the other years, the S&amp;P 500 did generally tend to move higher for at least part of the second half, but there have been a range of declines. The year with the largest decline in the second half was 1986 when the index fell 9.42% in September. And that was after a 7.53% decline shortly after the midpoint of the year in the first two weeks of July. The 1959 occurrence similarly saw a 9.17% decline from August through September. While it did not necessarily all happen within the second half of the year, the declines in the final days of the 1961 occurrence actually marked the beginning of a bear market that ultimately would see the S&amp;P 500 fall 23.6% from its late 1961 peak.

stocks,Admin I need help I need to post for an Advice request but I am not able to post anything...
stocks,"Publicly traded landscape companies My portfolio is mostly FAAMG, but I’m also long on $BV and $SITE. I’m planning on staying in both, but I don’t really love the future outlook of BV for growth unless they can pivot - it’s my understanding that a lot of their revenue comes from commercial development and servicing existing commercial accounts. I do like them, though, they’re industry big dogs, with talented numbers people and aggressive acquisition movements. And I fucking love SITE. Both have been good to me over the yrs, especially from Feb 1 - June 1, when other sectors can go sideways or see pullbacks/ corrections. I also have a bit of $SMG, but I’ve fallen out of love with them - underwhelming numbers and shitty chemicals. Wondering if anyone else is in any sort of landscape stocks? I can see these being better for swings (2/1 - 6/1) than long holds. Any thoughts on that? Thanks."
stocks,"What do you think about an imminent market crash? I know, I know, nobody can predict the market. But still, this growth feels unprecedented and unjustified. I get the optimism for the vaccinations and the end of the pandemic, but the market looks still way overvalued. I want to hear some opinions on that."
stocks,"If you could only buy 1 stock for the rest of your life, what would it be? (No ETFs or mutual funds) If for the rest of your life you can only 1 stock for your portfolio, what would it be?  You can't buy any ETFs or mutual funds, it needs to be one solo stock.  Which stock would it be and why?  For me, I think it would be AMZN or GOOGL because of how many different sources of revenue they have."
stocks,Covered calls 101 cuz I’m an idiot Can someone point my in the right direction? I’ve been sitting many on AAPL shares since 2008. I’m scared shitless of options because I really don’t understand it that much. I’ve been seeing more posts lately about covered calls and figured I have shares to spare. Is there a “Selling covered calls 101” video you’d recommend to get me started?
stocks,"RH Stop Limit Order when a price is rising? Trying to understand how this works...

I’m new to PDUFA’s and currently waiting on a press release for $PRVB that was supposed to come out today, but I’m guessing now won’t be released until after Robinhood extended trading.

If the press release comes out after-hours and it’s positive, then the ask price will be way high on Tuesday. But what happens if I do a Stop Limit Order now, before any of that? Does the stop trigger on Market open regardless, or can I “catch it” on the way up with the Limit price I specify, say $0.30 over current?

It seems pretty rigged if the press release comes out after retail can touch it but before the markets open on Tuesday😒"
stocks,"Investing with a small account So I'm new to the game. You can thank the January gme squeeze for that. I've been lurking on this page and some others as well since the craziness went down. Looking for some general tips and advise on investing with a 1500 dollar account. Obviously a low starting point but thats all I have to work with for the time being. I would be able to beef that up about 100-200 bucks every couple of weeks as I'm I get paid bi-weekly. 

Everyone and their mother will tell you to diversify your account but is that really the way to go with such a small account? Isn't it said that concentration builds wealth and diversification preserves it.

 Should look into how to trade options as the roi would be greater than owning stocks? How do I go about doing my due diligence? Where can you find info on a companies financials, yahoo finance perhaps? Thanks for any and all advise you can give to this noob."
stocks,"Why not create an all ETF portfolio? I’ve studied Finance and Data Science throughout college and use a variety of fundamental, technical, and financial strategies to select the best stocks for my personal portfolio. Over the past two years I’ve consistently underperformed the S&amp;P and greatly underperformed the NASDAQ (which I consider my benchmark given my heavy asset allocation in technology). 

This makes me wonder, why not just compose a portfolio of all ETF’s and indices. Was thinking of a combination of SPY, DIA, NDAQ, QQQ, ARKK, etc. maybe even incorporate sector ETF’s like QCLN/ICLN, THCX, IAU (gold, to hedge against inflation), and some small/mid-cap funds.

I feel like this strategy would help me diversify greatly and mitigate risk as much as possibly while generating above market returns. I’d probably go with something along the lines of 40% SPY, 30% QQQ, 15% ARKK, 5% QCLN, 5% THCX, 5% IAU. Aside from expense ratio fees I feel like this would help me beat the market and I can even incorporate automatic weekly deposits into the SPY and QQQ accordingly. 

Let me know what you think of this strategy oppose to spending so much time researching and conducting analyses only to underperform the market."
stocks,"What Can I Learn from Today Hi Everyone,

New to investing, and have followed the flowchart in personal finance to the letter.

Ultimately I decided to try an individual stock. After poking around, I noticed that NTLA experienced a breakthrough that is set to lead the company to grow substantially. I decided that was my stock. This was Sunday.

I could not buy any shares of this stock because Vanguard would not let me do anything until my deposited funds cleared. I watched it gain every day. Finally my funds clear and I buy a few shares yesterday at $170. Today, the stock dropped about 5%. I have no idea why or what happened. That’s fine, I’m just trying to learn. 

I just want to know if there is anything about what I have done that can be instructive for me. Thanks"
stocks,"% intraday change in price average over long period of time Is there a screener that allows you to find how much a stock/asset price has changed in terms of percentage, but not just for that day but the average % change for a whole month or year or longer?  And then rank/compare to other assets.  The ones I am seeing just shows you for the current day"

stocks,Thoughts on Norwegian Air Shuttle (NAS) Would any of you consider buying that NAS?
stocks,"XELA DD and short squeeze potential Upon further research it has absolutely blown my mind to see that XELA is expecting above a BILLION dollars in revenue but is stung at a 112 million dollar market-cap. This is insanely undervalued. 

Additionally 50% of the shares outstanding are owned by 19 share holders. There is no way they are selling for such tiny profits when this company is absurdly undervalued. This added with an over 30% short percentage. 

My apes and ladies… we are in for one hell of a rocket ship. Load up and pile in. This is one they cannot stop."
stocks,"Is Virgin Galactic worth to buy right now? Im assuming with there recent news of their crewed spaceflight in july 11 that when it does launch successfully their stocks will go up more?

stocks,"Microsoft is working with the small Nubeva for a reason. Take a look, could be worth your time TSX-V: NBVA  
OTC: NBVAF

 Nubeva develops and licenses proprietary software for the decryption of network traffic. Nubeva’s next-generation SKI (Session Key Intercept) technology represents a better, faster, easier, and lower-cost alternative to legacy decryption.

Just a couple days ago, Nubeva announced that with the preview of Microsoft's Windows Server 2022, Nubeva validated that their patented decryption software was successful. As security is Microsoft's headline priority, it is the utmost importance to make sure that Nubeva software can be ran and successful on the new server being delivered later this year.

Nubeva plans to release GA decryption support at the time of Microsoft's system general availability.

Assets are more than double liabilities, and revenues are the highest the company has ever seen. More than 10x 2020's April 30 in the TTM.

A little bit of all the super high tech goes over my head, however with all the announcements and validations on the new Microsoft system, it looks primed to grow as only a $62M market cap.

Stay safe, this is not financial advice!!"
stocks,"Should I dump 4k into Vanguard VTI? I have a hard time managing stocks. Right now I am buying 2 VTI every month, basically every paycheck.

I have 4k that I am comfortable with just buying VTI but I get scared doing it. This would be a long term hold, 5 to 10 years. 

I wanted to use the 5k to play in the market but I have been holding it and not doing anything with it. 

Would I be dumb to do it? I fear the market will crash and I'd lose out... but I have been fearing the market was gonna crash for the last 5 years and been holding off.. with my luck it will finally happen."
stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Friday, July 2, 2021. Please enjoy! **PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, July 2, 2021**

Stocks rose once again, with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ) both recording new intraday highs amid the continued push by technology stocks. The Dow Jones (DIA) rose as well, but continued to lag behind the other two indexes. Market participants are encouraged by the June Jobs Report, which showed payroll gains rise more than expected. 

Today, the US Department of Labor released the Job June report, which showed a stronger-than-expected acceleration in hiring, with non-farm payrolls rising by 850,000, the sixth straight month of gains. The unemployment rate however, ticked slightly higher to 5.9%. Here are the numbers

* **Change in non-farm payrolls:** 850,000 vs. 720,000 expected and an upwardly revised 583,000 in May
* **Unemployment rate:** 5.9% vs. 5.6% expected and 5.8% in May 
* **Average hourly earnings, month-over-month:** 0.3% vs. 0.3% expected and a downwardly revised 0.4% in May
* **Average hourly earnings, year-over-year:** 3.6% vs. 3.6% expected and a downwardly revised 1.9% in May

President Biden said of the report, “This is historic progress, pulling our economy out of the worst crisis in 100 years, driven in part by our dramatic progress in vaccinating our nation and beating back the pandemic. Today, the US is the only major advanced economy where the OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) projections of future output are higher today than they were in January 2020 before the pandemic hit.”

Emily Roland, co-Chief Investment Strategist at John Hancock Investment Management said of the report, “This is the Goldilocks Report that the market was looking for today. You had a nice print here of 850,000 jobs being added, wage pressure remaining – I wouldn't call them necessarily contained – but surprising here on the downside versus consensus estimates. So this is telling us right now that economic growth is continuing to accelerate here, the jobs market is continuing to heal. We're making progress here in terms of what the Fed has set out to do, which is in order to get unemployment down, they're going to let inflation run a little bit hot here. Not too hot, not too cold – this is just what the market wants.""

This Job Report will give market participants a better idea as to the timing of the Federal Reserve’s next monetary policy. For now, the Fed has so far kept in place both of its key pandemic-era policies - quantitative easing at a clip of $120 billion a month and near-zero interest rates. However, the Fed has consistently said they are looking for a “string” of strong jobs reports, like the one this month before any adjustments to the current policy is made. If the Jobs Report continues being especially strong in the months ahead, it could force the Fed to taper quantitative easing earlier than originally telegraphed. I have said  before in the past I expect the Fed to begin tapering QE towards the end of the year and am not worried about that at all. For starters, the market has historically reacted very little to changes in QE ([see the 2013 Taper Tantrum here)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taper-tantrum.asp), it’s changes in the interest rate that really drive the market, and second, the Fed is expected to taper slowly, making any changes gradual.

**Highlights**

* Shares of AMC pulled back slightly after financial firm Iceberg Research announced they have opened a short position. Honestly, I have no idea why they did this, only opening themselves up to becoming WSB's next target. Will be interesting to see what happens moving forward.
* More bad news for Lordstown Motors, who have already been the subject of a short report that saw the company admit they had inflated the importance of preorders for the electric pickup truck and forced the CEO to leave. Now, the Justice Department has announced it is opening a probe into the company to investigate comments made by executives and the way the company represented its pre orders to shareholders. The whole EV market was down today in sympathy. 
* Tesla (TSLA) recorded its fifth straight quarter of vehicle delivery growth. In Q2, the company delivered 201,250 vehicles, missing expectations for 204,160, according to Bloomberg consensus data**,** but more than double the 90,891 vehicles delivered in the same period a year ago.
* The U.S. Federal Trade Commission filed a proposed consent order to settle antitrust charges against semiconductor maker Broadcom Inc, the agency said in a statement on Friday. The consent order requires Broadcom to stop demanding that its customers buy components mostly or only from Broadcom. The company responded, “While we disagree that our actions violated the law and disagree with the FTC’s characterizations of our business, we look forward to putting this matter behind us.""
* Jeff Bezos is officially stepping down as Amazon CEO on Monday. Amazon Web Services CEO Andy Jassey will be taking over for him.

stocks,"US Stocks: how/when they get listed in EU stock exchanges? Hey investors! I never understood why some US stocks listed on Nasdaq or Nyse are listed also in European stock exchanges (I.e. Frankfurt, Paris etc) and why others are not.

Is it a company decision or is there some other mechanism behind? Like some valuation requirement or maybe time?

For example, today Astra Space (HOL -&gt; ASTR) went public on Nasdaq. I would like to find it on a German stock exchange. What are the probabilities it will be listed and how?

stocks,"REIT investment help Hello everyone, I hope your portfolios had a green day today and that you all had a good day outside the markets as well. 

I’m currently looking into a good REIT investment, but am having a bit of trouble determining which is the best moving forward.

As we all know, the real estate market is in a weird state, and housing prices as a whole are climbing and likely to continue climbing for a solid 2 years or so as we recover from Covid causing housing prices to rise more and have issues with supply or demand, differentiated based on the economic status of different areas throughout the US of course. Unfortunately at 19 yrs old, I don’t have the capital or experience to start when the market is rising with no real climax being predictable. So the obvious solution (for me) would be a RIET.

My best contender as of right now is CTRE, but as they manage healthcare properties, I would like a more residential/ city infrastructure option if possible."

In my scenario you buy multiple lots over a period of months and then sell all at once with a single order with some of the lots being sold at a loss and others being sold with profit and the overall total being profit.  If the stock then drops within the month and I want to buy additional shares at a price lower than what I sold, are the wash sale rules going to apply because of the lots that were sold at a loss or does the fact they were all sold at once for an overall profit wipe the slate clean?

I’ve tried searching for this answer but am not finding this scenario so I may just be phrasing this poorly. Thank you."

stocks,"Does buying fractional shard truly get you full shares, or do you simply just have a bunch of siloed fractions of stocks? For example, if I buy .25 shares of Microsoft every week, will I really have 1 full share after 4 weeks? Or will I just have 4 separately acknowledged fractional shares of MSFT?

I’m wondering because some brokerage apps (I think Robinhood, for example) don’t allow the transfer of fractional shares to a new app — they just sell those and give you cash for it I believe. So if I want to move my Fidelity shares to the newest cool app in 2050, will I have to sell off a bunch of individual fractional shares?"

stocks,"Is Robinhood really a GOOD GUY?? # Robinhood Wants You to Buy Robinhood Stock on Robinhood

## The trading app is allocating up to 35% of its IPO shares to individual investors, part of a strategy to bring IPO investing to the masses.  Is RobinHood being a good guy?  Do they want to let the little guy in to the big leagues.  Maybe.  Normally shares go to the large institutional investors.  So why the change.  Could be as I said Robinhood feels bad for how they did the little guy wrong, or maybe the company is overpriced and the big buys did not want the shares.  Think about it, if there was money to be made would the large funds not want every piece of the pie they could get? I think the big funds are a little nervous about buying into Robinhood so the left over shares are going to us.  Do you own DD and good luck.

stocks,"90% of Net Asset in Stocks — Anxious I have started buying stocks with very little money back in 2014. 
Never brought anything risky and did not see much growth.


Then in 2016 I got a ‘Tech’ Job in Silicon Valley where Salary is heavy in RSU ( restricted stock unit) and employees can buy with ESPP ( 15% discount on fair market value)

That Company ( Company A) did really good in next 4 years and by 2020 I have around 500k in Vested stock + ESPP purchase. 
Never sold any.


Then in 2020 I got a job in one of the FAANG companies ( Company B) with even a bigger chunk of RSU + ESPP 


After first vest ( 2021) and espps in Company B, I have around 200k in this FAANG company stock.


So now my situation is :
I have only around 80k in my checking account. ( had little more but spent on a down payment)
Around 50k in 401k ( started in 2020 only, never before understood it + Company B has very good match) but funds selected are 100% stocks again.


500k stocks from previous company ( Company A)


200k stocks in current company B ( and more adding up every quarter by vesting + ESPP)


Another 150k in my personal trading account.


So 80k cash + 50k (401k … in stock funds 😞) + around ‘850k’ of pure stocks( and some option trading money )


Both the tech companies are good + long time players + have steady growth in earnings and not some loss making unicorns like Uber/Airbnb etc … but by any means their price looks overvalued ( Don’t know by how much, my current company B is one having 2T market cap yet no sign of stopping 😔)


I have huge ‘anxiety’ on what to do.

A) I don’t want to sell previous ( Company A ) and Current ( Company B) companies stocks with the ‘fear’ that they might grow even more.( Company A already 5x from original value in 2016)

BUT

B) Most of my last 6 years savings are bound to stock and although I was much younger to experience 1999/2008 crash but heard about them + all the predictions on inflation/another crash and SCARED to lose all these money if and when that happens.

So any good advice for a novice from a kind soul is much appreciated."
stocks,"How do stocks actually work? From my understanding to make money through stocks you have to pay for stocks and hope the company etc. You invest in makes enough money to give you more back..?

If this is the case why would you not just buy stock in a really successful business like Tesla, so you can make tons of profit?

 It’s just hitting me while writing this, but if you pay for lots of stock and sell it, does the stock of everyone else go down because you take your money back?

stocks,"What am I trying to do here? $FMCCH So I maybe, foolishly bought 100 shares FMCCH after I saw the big drop. Well, of course it has continued to drop. I intend to hold on to it and have been wanting to try my hand at options but I get confused by the lingo so here is the scenario I would like to have and hopefully you guys can tell me if it is possible.

I have 100 shares so essentially I would like to set up an option to call them away from me if it reaches a lower level, would that be a cash covered call? I would be looking to make passive income on the option. 

Go easy on me, I'm new at this :D"
stocks,"Schlumberger and halliburton The meeting with OPEC yesterday proved that they still are favoring higher oil prices and will (probably,) produce 400k bpd from August until December. I did see an article that said there were some disagreements in the cartel, which signals they MAY NOT ramp up production at all, but I think we will see they stick to the 400 bpd they seemed to agree on yesterday.

I think this OPEC meeting signaled that crude is going to have an opportunity to leg up again, as US shale is not in a place to compete, giving OPEC control of the market for another few months. I believe $80 Brent is going to be here before the summer is over and ITM calls for 3-6 months out will be fairly easy money. These stocks have already seen significant runs up, but have not kept up pace with the rise of crude oil. 

Schlumberger and halliburton are both in a position to do well following this OPEC news. I did not buy shares, instead chose to buy slightly otm calls for 6 months out. 

am big on Exxon, but as inventories deplete, I believe we will see more gains on the services side of things rather than refiners and producers. I still am long shares/calls Exxon, Devon and Suncor though. 

I do still like the pipelines, mainly enbridge as well. The OIH is also a fantastic way to play this, but the options are very expensive which I believe signals the upside risk of near term crude volatility."

stocks,"Valuing a Company with Multiples Let’s take a look at 4 commonly used ratios and why 2 of these ratios may tell a better story than the other 2:

**P/S** (Price to Sales): Price/ Sales per share or Market cap/ Sales

**P/E** (Price to Earnings): Price/ EPS (earnings per share) or Market Cap/ earnings

**EV/ NTM Sales** (Enterprise Value/ Next Twelve Months Sales): (Market cap + debt - cash &amp; cash equivalents)/ Next 12 months estimated sales

**EV/ EBITDA** (Enterprise Value/ Earnings\* before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization): (Market cap + debt - cash &amp; cash equivalents)/ Earnings\* before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization

\*Earnings is the amount of profit left after all expenses have been paid, mostly synonymous with net income.

&amp;#x200B;

Let’s compare using Market Capitalization in our ratios versus Enterprise Value.

**Market Cap**: Share price x Shares outstanding

**Enterprise Value**: Market cap + Debt - Cash &amp; Cash equivalents

Notice what Market Cap is missing? It doesn’t include a company’s debt. **Debt is inherently included in the value of a company, because if a company were to be bought out, the buyers would have to take on the debt obligation. Both the P/E and the P/S ratios don’t consider the amount of debt a company is obligated to pay**. This is why I prefer to use the EV/ NTM Sales ratio over the P/S ratio, and the EV/EBITDA ratio over the P/E ratio, as it gives a more accurate representation of a company’s worth.

Cash and cash equivalents are subtracted in the EV formula because it is assumed they are already included when calculating market cap. Think of it like this: If you bought a company for $10,000, but that company had $2,000 of cash on hand, your “real” cost to buy the company would be $8,000 since you would have access to the company’s cash after buying it.

stocks,"$MMAT / $TRCH Squeeze &amp; Tesla Partnership Plan ⚠️ PLEASE READ ⚠️
DD : Mildest from Webull 
TWITTER : @1AJ

According to Data from
https://nakedshortreport.com
( Follow the pictures of the post )
( There’s 2 because merge wasn’t finish and Data comes out for $TRCH &amp; $MMAT )

Shorts haven’t covered &amp; I have proof that we will squeeze with certain requirements.

Choice 1: Massive Volume 
Choice 2: Exhaust The Shorts 

Choice 1: 

With massive volume, we can squeeze the shorts, Data from $AMC ( Circled in the picture ) on June 2
 
272,472,248 (Us)	122,341,498 ( Them	44.92

As you can see, they didn’t have enough to cover our volume, how did they do this? With a catalyst.
On June 2 this was announced 
“As of June 2, AMC had 501,780,240 shares outstanding that will be entitled to a vote at the upcoming Shareholder Meeting” 

This attracted buyers and caught them off guard pushing the price to ATH and settling at a new support of $54-$57 

How does this apply to $MMAT?!?

Our catalyst for this push is this 

“@Metamaterialtec management will hold a live webcast presentation on Tuesday, July 6th, at 1PM EDT, to discuss recent events and META's future #growth initiatives.”
 
What do we need them to say? We need them to announce something worth getting buyers attentions and pushing a rally of buyers, what could this be?

The Tesla partnership, them confirming they’re supplying / working with them, anyone who’s done dd or follows me on webull knows I’ve been posting and pushing this so people can findout,. Once the stock market finds out we should see a push form buyers and since we are shorted this should attract yup you guess it wall street bets. 

What happens if I don’t sell on the squeeze? We will reach all time highs and a new average, the company still works and provides for them as they have a contact with them until like 2026, our page over at twitter: @TRCHXMETA has this information and pretty much confirms this.
Positive we will still be fighting shorts but with this company being under the wing with Tesla and making an estimate of 10B in revenue, we couldn’t be worry for a dump. We are also added to the Russell 3000, that’s why we were added to the NASDAQ.

That’s is the conclusion of choice 1.

Choice 2 is basically keep hitting these guys with buying power until they give up, eventually they’ll have such a high borrow fee that it will squeeze just like AMC in January, failure to do this will allow shorts to cover and we will be holding for much longer until other catalyst come, just like how AMC ran out of juice from $20 to $5 and holding for about 4-5 months until it happened again and the battle starting over again. So far we are able to keep them above at 40% fee since we manage to have volume in the millions.

Thanks for reading and I would like your output on this, I’m mostly looking forward to choice 1 as you can see."

If I sold the stock Id get a GFV

However the recent explosion in the price has given me the thought of taking my profit now and waiting to re-enter at a lower price.

Their product is much better than Crowdstrike. For example the Mitre attack framework is what everyone judges security by these days (or at least that’s the way it’s going).

Before Microsoft started giving comforting yet creepy messages like ""Don't worry, we're setting everything up for you.""

Thanks, Microsoft. I prefer some real non-patronizing, verbosity that actually tells me wtf is going on. Oh, and have you used a 15 year old Windows XP machine?

I know Linux does Live OS' too.

But the reason I'm bullish on MSFT is because our government is bullish on MSFT for security. Ever since that solarwinds BS hack. I always pay attention to those subsidies. It's why corn wheat and soy is so big in the US. MSFT is just another corn/wheat/soy stock. A genetically modified OS.

stocks,"75% Overall Revenue Growth, 100% Sales Growth, lowered loss per share to 4 cents from 6, stock is down 40% 3 months, EZGO, Reported June 30 Hello everyone and thank you for taking the time to view this post. Every now and then we come across a company that captivates us, where the story sounds good, the opportunity sounds good... and then we either do not have the money to cease the opportunity or we may have missed out. Here is a company who reported June 30th and is delivering absolutely amazing results but the stock is not being rewarded.

EZGO focused on Ebikes in China. They reported 6 month their 1st Half results (September 1st 2020 until March 31st 2021)  days ago. Initially the stock jolted from 4.35 to 5.15...... Yesterday it closed near 4! This is a 40% frop from 3 months ago when it was trading over 7. Why this matters is the company now has much better prospects and has now delivered solid results.

The sales for the first 6 months were 9.6 million a 75% growth over the same period a year before. Bike sales increased 100% to 34,000+ units.. This company as a whole is valued at 50 million. Their fiscal 2020 year total sales were 16 million. The CEO has said in February sales should be about 100,000.

These results reported June 30th did not include a big sales of over 10,000 bikes to Ukraine April 1st. This also did not include a 10,000 bike order on April 15th from a bike Expo. These results also did not include a 5,000 bike order from a distributor at the end of April. In April alone we are looking at 25,000+ bike sales which almost eclipses the previous 6 month total!

The company has introduced higher margin bikes. Also, the growth on the 3 wheel bikes was actually 600 percent. The company actually lost 487,000 in 2020 period or 6 cents a share on 5.5 million in sales. The fact that they increased sales and lost less is amazing. This time was 9.6 million sales and a loss of 358,00 or 4 cents a share. 

On June 15th the company closed on a new facility with 5x the production capacity. Remember, the CEO had a 100,000 bike forecast in February before the large orders in April. It is my belief that he knows the company will sell way more than 100,000 bikes. April alone we are looking at 25,000+ bikes and the previous 6 months were 34,000. That is already 60k bikes with 5 more months to go..

I am long EZGO and the company is absolutely executing. This stock was near 20, but it is now affordable for everyone. If you have any questions or thoughts please share. Since the last report in February which was also good the stock is down 50%."

stocks,"Taking a loan out to put more cash in an investment account. I personally prefer to pay cash for purchases but I've heard the argument that you shouldn't bother paying down a mortgage earlier since rates are so low. Instead of paying down the mortgage you should invest the extra payments. Which theoretically, mathematically makes sense. Even the smoothest of brains should be able to get 4% return. So if your APR is 3% and you pay off early, you're basically throwing away 1% and quite possibly much much more. 

So, my question is two fold.

1-Does anyone actually do this and how is it working out?

2-Should this logic be applied to all loans, like a car loan ?"

stocks,"Southwest Leading up to earnings 7/22 (LUV) Airlines have been getting hammered recently due to the Delta variant, which makes sense why it’s hard to get good revenue when things open up and then close back down again. One of the first airlines to announce their earnings is Southwest and American. Southwest being only domestic to United States really, still seems like the preferred travel in terms of ease and customer service.

Currently their price sits at $53.84 as of July 1, and they just endured a brutal month that took them down almost 13%. They seem to be making a comeback after recent news on Boeing 737 purchases from other airlines and increased demand for the summer flights. I see this making a nice steady upward movement for the summertime as flights become more and more packed domestically. If you can’t fly international, many will want to get out of their area still somewhere in the states. 

I’m thinking this month they could hit $57-$58 before earnings, and I fully expect earnings to be good since most of their travel isn’t disrupted by international borders being closed. 

Gas prices are going up though, and the Middle East basically emphasized that there will be less oil than more circulating for now. This could eat at airline costs, also stunting their growth. 

Southwest is hovering still somewhere close to pre-pandemic levels and never really broke out to new levels. I’m thinking airlines will make a comeback this month as summer travel proves to be desired. 

Thoughts on stock price this week, the week after the 4th of July, up till and after earnings?"
stocks,"Building a Growth at a Reasonable Price (GARP) Portfolio I've been struggling these past few months at settling on a portfolio that I was happy with. I am young (23), so I wanted my investments to take advantage of that by being more aggressive with growth. At the same time, I realize that the current market is overextended, and a lot of the companies I really like are trading with a lot of that growth priced in. So, I wanted to put together a portfolio that would satisfy my risk/reward tolerance without having to pay a hefty premium.

The two pieces of advice that I greatly resonate with are:

1. Invest in a great company at a good price &gt; good company at a great price
2. concentration builds wealth, diversification preserves it

So I wanted to keep the number of stocks low (&lt;10) and put my money in companies for which I have high conviction. I started out by first creating a list of sectors that I think are best set up for hyper-growth in the next 10-20 years. For me, those are:

* Tech &gt; Information &amp; Communications / AI, AR, and Automation / Cyber Security
* Financial Services &gt; FinTech
* Healthcare &gt; Health Tech &amp; Genomics
* Consumer Cyclicals &gt; Internet Retail / Gambling
* EVs

Obviously, that list is not exhaustive, but those are the areas I feel the most comfortable with and in which I can see the long-term potential. I used that list as a starting point to look into companies and solidify the ones that will make up my portfolio. Some of the positions are more speculative than others, but I have found to have a compelling enough business model for me to invest in. If you have any criticism or suggestions, please comment below! I'm always looking to learn and discover great companies!

# Portfolio Holdings:

**FB**

For me, this was a no-brainer. The fundamentals are absurdly strong; pretty much no debt with a boatload of free cash. Consistent share buybacks (although not much) and increase in revenue. Outside of the main platform, it owns Instagram and Whatsapp which are incredibly sticky apps. Not to mention all the other projects they have going on (Occulus, FB Watch, etc.). What appealed to me the most was the fact that their ROIC is one of the best compared to the other FAANG stocks. There's also still room for ARPU to grow, especially on the international level. Instagram is also getting reworked to increase monetization. This stock is still undervalued/fairly valued and has, in my opinion, a lot more growth compared to some of the other FAANG companies.

&amp;#x200B;

**SOFI**

I wanted a piece of the fintech space, but the industry leaders PYPL and SQ are way too expensive for me to justify starting a position now. Comparatively, SOFI is trading way below their multiples and there's a lot to like about this company. With SPACs, a lot of the time the fundamentals do not match up to the hype they receive. However, SOFI's Q1 report showed tremendous YOY growth with promising guidance. They also show an increase in the number of users that use more than one of their services, which is an extremely important part of their identity. Now bears may say that this company lacks a moat because traditional banks can just enter the space easily, however, that's not considering one of the most compelling parts of this company, which is their acquisition of Galileo, a payment processor that is integrated with over 90% digital banks in North America and over 70 of the top 100 FinTech companies. So, even as more competitors enter the space, SOFI stands to benefit from that.

Not to mention their management team is stacked with talent. What really sealed the deal for me was the vision of CEO Anthony Noto. In a recent interview, Noto states that the reason SOFI hasn't gone international, despite the interest, is that they wanted to keep refining the product and make sure it can suit the user as best as it can before expanding overseas. This is a CEO that really cares about what they're building and the people who use it.

There's a lot of tailwinds for this company, and even if the fed does increase interest rates in 2022/23, they only stand to benefit.

&amp;#x200B;

**DKNG**

This position hinges on political policy, but I'm optimistic about it given how smooth the process of legalizing online betting in the US has been so far. The balance sheet may not be the cleanest, but companies like these typically spend a lot upfront in the form of CACs, and they've done an amazing job in that regard at making this company a household brand. Q1 2021 reports that monthly unique payers (MUPs) increased 114% yoy.

There's so much growth ahead in the short and long term. Over half the country has legalized betting (in some shape) in 3 years. The gambling market size is predicted to undergo hyper-growth in the next 10 years. Furthermore, DKNG has expressed interest in the esports scene, which is also something that has and will see explosive growth.

With that all said, I don't think the stock is cheap, and there are definitely a lot of risks here, but I believe in what they've done so far and can see a lot of upside in the long term.

&amp;#x200B;

**ABBV**

I was between this and BMY, and I might end up just going 50/50 in both. Great fundamentals, a lot to like. Strong top-line revenue growth yoy and a lot of free cash flow. Share buybacks every year, except for the most recent when they issued shares to raise money for their acquisition. There's some concern that HUMIRA, their most popular drug which makes up about 50% of their revenue, has its exclusivity period ending 2023, but their recent acquisition of Allergen positions them well for the future. ABBV is certainly not a crazy hypergrowth stock, but they still have room for growth and their dividend is king. Especially now, when it's trading at a very reasonable valuation, it's a great time to buy in.

&amp;#x200B;

**BABA**

I'm sure this stock needs no explanation on this sub. I really think this stock, or the likes of TENCHY, belongs in every portfolio that's focused on long-term growth at a reasonable price. So unless you're extremely against Chinese companies and the risk they may present, this is an absolute steal at these prices. In fact, right now most U.S companies are overvalued whereas almost every Chinese stock is undervalued.

&amp;#x200B;

**COIN**

I stayed far away from buying into this company when it IPO'd. Now it has fallen to a pretty reasonable valuation, so I decided to start a small position. I hold a small crypto portfolio myself and although I don't think crypto will replace fiat money, I still see a lot of potential in it long term for a variety of uses. If you don't believe in crypto at all, then it's a lot harder to justify buying into this company.

COIN itself is one of the most popular crypto exchanges and they posted blistering numbers in their 2021 Q1 report. Granted, a lot of that was tied to the initial explosion of crypto in mainstream media, but the conservative projections for the full year of 2021 are still great. Crypto is still in its infancy in terms of mainstream support and use and the potential TAM is massive.

That said in the short term, there will be a lot of volatility with this stock. That's why I'm starting with a very small position, with the intention to add if the numbers and guidance continue to impress. Bear cases made of COIN usually rests on the fact that there is nothing proprietary about COIN or that they depend too heavily on transaction fees, which I fully acknowledge, but they have the name recognition and the biggest userbase, and it'll be up to their management team to make the right moves and continue to innovate. I'm still learning about the crypto space, but there's a lot more than just a means of exchange.

&amp;#x200B;

**CLF**

American steel. Steel futures have been unstoppable lately, with the re-opening and word that an infrastructure deal is in the works, there's a lot to like about steel. News of China pulling back from steel exports also allows American steel to be more competitive in the marketplace. Yet, despite all these catalysts, the prices of companies like CLF are still lagging behind. This is not your typical growth play, and I personally see this as a short-term (6-12 months) position, due to steel's cyclical nature. I'll also admit I got into this a few months before when CLF was sitting at 18 a share. Still, CLF is poised to gain a lot, and quite a lot to like about this company. The management team under Lourenco Goncalves has revitalized CLF, making big acquisitions of AK Steel and ArcelorMittal USA. He's also recently gone and raised Q2 2021 guidance, and there's reason to believe that even that was conservative for how hot the industry is currently. 

If you're interested in learning more about the thesis behind steel, I'd suggest checking out r/Vitards. Anyways, I don't know if I'm going to hold this position for say 10+ years, so I'll be looking to capitalize on some short-term gains and use those profits to either open up a new position or fuel my current investments.

&amp;#x200B;

**TDOC**

This is also a very speculative position, similar to COIN. After the major pullback, I believe TDOC is at a very fair evaluation. Despite posting another quarter without profit, there's a lot to like about this company. They have one of the highest NPS scores, significantly greater than AMZN and APPL, which is something that's very compelling and which is something the balance sheet doesn't reflect. Combine that with the fact that they have captured a big chunk of the market, with healthcare professionals and big institutions, makes the company very, very sticky. Even if it only is the ""Zoom for healthcare,"" the quality is strong enough that users won't just drop it for just any other substitute. 

But it's not just the ""Zoom for healthcare"". The acquisitions it has made, both BetterHelp and Livongo, have amazing implications and have yet to show their full potential on TDOC's balance sheet. There's still so much of the healthcare space that can be innovated, and TDOC is primed to take over.

For right now, I'm OK with TDOC being unprofitable even with the pandemic pushing it along so well. That tells me they're funneling their revenue back into research and development to continue to build up its services and revenue streams.

I also believe that telehealth is still in its infancy, and even though it was massively adopted during COVID, that only accelerates its long-term use and adoption by a little bit. It's going to take a while before it becomes sophisticated enough for people to see the value. This is a long-term play to which I will be consistently adding.

&amp;#x200B;

**BARK**

Barkbox features in delivering monthly care packages for dogs on a subscription basis. This is something that's not as hyped as EVs, but pet care is a fast-growing market that sees more spending each year. In fact, quarantine boosted the number of pet owners in the US dramatically. Barkbox has seen tremendous yoy growth in revenue and subscriptions, with a CAGR, gross margins, and a returning customer rate that beats the industry leader CHWY as well as other popular brands. BARK has made a lot of partnerships with the likes of AMZN, WMT, TGT, etc., and looks to continue to expand vertically in the space of dog hygiene/medicine/food. All of this while trading at a much lower multiple than the other big pet care brands. 

The management team is fantastic. Manish Joneja, CEO of BARK, has 2 decades of experience as director of Amazon global exports and expansion and 5+ years on eBay as product lead. Carly Strife and Henrik Werdelin have been featured in Forbes 30 under 30 and Top 100 Most Creative/Top 100 people in tech, respectively. 

The bear case of this company is that they have no moat, but their customer retention speaks a lot to brand loyalty and satisfaction. CHWY also has a box subscription service for dogs, however, it's nowhere close to as popular as BARK. BARK is also expanding internationally, starting first with Australia.

Will it get to where CHWY is? That part isn't clear and it depends on how well BARK is able to build on what it has and expand what it has to offer. But the stock has a lot of room to run given the current valuation, and the product is sticky enough to either allow them to succeed or be a target for an acquisition.

stocks,"AGFY has long term potential, but looking to diversify within vertical farming I have been interested in Agrify because they provide indoor growing solutions and vertical farming.

stocks,"Do not fall for Krispy Kreme’s IPO trap: A legacy brand with no organic growth that will remain unprofitable TL;DR - Short TF out of this or buy puts once available. A company riddled with a history of fraud, misleading investors, and deceitful accounting tactics is being dumped to the public by a large private equity firm.

My god, this is one of the most blatant cash outs I’ve ever seen. CNBC was pumping this name all morning and interviewed their CEO who touted its new “Omni channel” strategy that will lead to better margins. My BS meter started going off so I decided to read their S-1 and see what was going on under the hood.

Krispy Kreme used to be public in the 2000’s and was acquired by JAB Holdings in 2016 for $1.35 billion following numerous scandals of channel stuffing and overstating revenues. Execs would pretty much order shipments of donuts to be sent to franchises and claim sales to meet quarterly estimates. Wild. There are other irregular accounting techniques used throughout the years along with bullying tactics used against franchise owners but you get the picture, won’t go into detail.

So now after a few years of being private sprinkled with an acquisition (Insomnia Cookies), execs/JAB decided it was time to cash out.

In the presentation, Krispy Kreme emphasizes its strong revenue growth. This is a trap. Their organic growth is flat +1% at most when you strip out revenues from their debt heavy acquisition which is why their margins are just awful now and will not improve. It also excludes new shops that were recently opened because it does not matter if you are growing as a company if you can’t achieve economies of scale. You see this a lot with companies who know they can’t be profitable - emphasize revenue growth! 

Krispy Kreme shouldn’t trade at more than 1x its revenue until it proves it can be profitable through some miraculous turnaround. At a $3 billion market cap currently, I forecast it is nearly 40% overvalued. This should be a $10 stock. Whoever the lead underwriter was for this IPO deserves a raise after pulling such a ridiculous multiple. I guess that’s why companies go public when the market is at all-time highs."

* **Support the ongoing** **Food and Drug Administration** **(“FDA”) review of our ZIMHI™** **New Drug Application.**
* **Advance our Phase 2/3 trial for examining the effects of Tempol on COVID-19.**
* **Support ongoing efforts to obtain government funding for Tempol.**
* **Advance the Investigational New Drug for Tempol’s use in radiation dermatitis.**
* **Demonstrate a further increase in SYMJEPI® sales.**
* **Maintain a strong capital position and healthy balance sheet.**
* **Prioritize progress across our entire product pipeline.**

**Based on our decades of collective experience in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical sectors, we firmly believe that Adamis is nearing a promising inflection point**\*\*. We contend it is not the time to deviate from these priorities. The progress we are beginning to catalyze for SYMJEPI®, ZIMHI™ and now Tempol stems from months and years of planning and work. This is the time to remain focused on – not pull back from – the efforts we are undertaking.\*\*

Hammann** **– a holder of 1,000 shares with no industry expertise, no public company experience and no articulated plan – is trying to remove and replace 80% of your Board.** **We believe a more effective way for stockholders to communicate concerns is to write to the Company directly instead of seemingly throwing away a vote on Mr. Hammann’s misguided effort.**

**We urge stockholders not to be misled for a number of reasons, including:**

* **Mr. Hammann** **initially demanded a lucrative and unjusitified paid consulting agreement – which would have been paid for with stockholders’ capital – before he was even a stockholder of the Company.**
* **Mr. Hammann** **threatened to make books and records demands and to run a campaign against the Board if we did not quickly agree to award him the demanded consulting agreement.**
* **Mr. Hammann** **has no operating experience in the biotechnology or pharmaceutical sector.**
* **Mr. Hammann** **has no experience as a director or executive of a public company.**
* **Mr. Hammann** **has a history of filing serial lawsuits and being a vexatious litigator.**
* **Mr. Hammann** **submitted an untimely and invalid notice of director nominations. His nominations will not be accepted at the Annual Meeting.**
* **Mr. Hammann** **unsuccessfully sued the Company in an attempt to delay the Annual Meeting and forced us to expend precious stockholder capital on fending off litigation.**
* **Mr. Hammann** **has no plan for the Company.**

**We hope stockholders recognize that supporting Mr. Hammann’s misguided campaign would be akin to taking what we believe is a major risk. Rather than support a litigious stockholder that is waging a costly and distracting battle with the Company, we urge you to reject his efforts by voting to re-elect your current Board.**

stocks,"Reminder: Don't blindly trust analysts' ratings. They can issue positive recommendations to pump their own investments. Many investors incorporate analysts' ratings into their due diligence process. However, they can be a huge conflicts of interest, as the investment banks are allowed to give recommendations on investments they own. It's very easy for them to buy a position and then later go on news shows, like CNBC and Cramer, to tell the public that they should be buying the stock, too. The analysts' recommendations hold sway with the public since they are the ""experts"" who work at big, prestigious firms, like Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and Goldman Sachs.

[Here is a clip from a Frontline documentary on the 2000 dot-com crash,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5iE-4JsUms&amp;t=1675s) where analysts admitted to going on the news to pump up and be ""cheerleaders"" for companies that paid their firm to handle their IPO's. As you recall, the dot-com crash was largely caused by people being euphoric about any company going IPO. This clip illustrates the investment banks' role in the euphoria and how they do not have your best interests in mind.

Personally, it shocks me that investment banks are able to provide recommendations and price targets without any kind of oversight or regulations, as they can easily just issue positive opinions to pump and dump their own investments."

The Nasdaq (QQQ) closed roughly even, as the rally in technology stocks takes a breather. The Dow Jones (DIA), which lagged the other two major indexes for all of June, continued its recovery. 

Market participants are encouraged a stronger-than-expected gain on private payrolls and tempered inflationary fears. Looking ahead, market participants wait for Q2 earnings season and the incoming June Jobs Report, which is expected to be released tomorrow. 

ADP’s June private payroll report showed private payrolls increased faster than expected[.](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/adp-june-private-payrolls-jobs-market-pandemic-economy-recovery-121542029.html) This underscores the ongoing economic recovery with the US economy reporting its sixth straight monthly increase in employment. Job openings rose by 692,000 versus the 600,000 expected. Consumer confidence has also risen and pointed to Americans' increased propensity to spend, with the Conference Board's consumer confidence index racing to its highest level since February 2020. 

During the second quarter, the technology, communication, real estate, and energy sectors were the best performers, underscoring the rotation from “reopening” and cyclical stocks that led the market higher earlier in the year back into technology and growth stocks. The rotation coincided with tempered fears, with the market rocketing higher after an initial 4% sell-off following the release of the April Consumer Price Index. It seems the market has now accepted Powell and other monetary official’s narrative that current inflationary pressures are “transitory” and due mostly to pandemic-induced disruptions.

Looking ahead, market participants wait for the June Jobs Report and are gearing up for Q2 earnings season, with earnings expected to continue being super-charged by stronger than expected demand from savings-loaden consumers and the continued reopening of the US economy thanks to effective distribution of the coronavirus vaccine. So far, analysts are looking for S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 61.9% year-on-year in aggregate, according to FactSet data – an estimate UBS's Head of Equity Derivatives Research Stuart Kaiser said may still be ""need to be revised higher."" 

**Highlights**

* Robinhood filed its S-1 Prospectus, marking a significant step forward as the company prepares for an upcoming IPO using the ticker HOOD. According to the S-1, Robinhood has 17.7 million monthly active users, with nearly 50% of those being first-time investors. Total revenue grew 245% to $959 million between the end of December 2019 and December 2020. The company was profitable in 2020, improving from a loss in 2019, but lost $1.4 billion in the first three months of 2021 amid the Gamestop frenzy that happened earlier in the year. This will be very interesting to watch, I have my popcorn out and ready to see what unfolds. 
* Shares of donut-maker Krispy Kreme (DNUT) popped in today’s IPO, with the stock rising roughly 23% after trading became open to the public.
* U.S. manufacturing sector activity retreated more than expected in June, reaching the lowest level since January. The Institute for Supply Management's June purchasing managers' index, a monthly indicator of U.S. economic activity based on a survey of purchasing managers at more than 300 manufacturing firms, fell to 60.6. This came following a print of 61.2 in May, and came in below the 60.9 expected, according to Bloomberg consensus data. As long as the number is over 50 though, it shows growth in the sector. 
* Facebook (FB) has teamed up with French video game maker Ubisoft Entertainment SA to bolster its cloud-gaming platform with popular titles such as ""Assassin's Creed"". In recent weeks competition for cloud-based gaming platforms between mega-cap tech stocks has intensified, with Google, Microsoft, and Amazon (AMZN) all ramping up their efforts.
* Chinese ride-hailing giant Didi (DIDI) rose roughly 15% today, recovering after a disappointing IPO debut yesterday. 
* Megan Thee Stallion is following in the footsteps of fellow celebrity Miley Cyrus by partnering with financial payments company Square (SQ) Cash App to give away $1 million worth of stock to her fans, another sign the push for retail investors and education is going ever more mainstream.

stocks,"Long range Put options for AMC or Meme Stocks Trade idea:

Whether the squeeze happens or not, AMC's pricing cannot be sustained in the $50-$60 range. If it squeezes the pricing will crater shortly. If it doesn't squeeze, Reddittors will lose interest and the pricing will come down as demand craters.

Risks:

**AMC follows a TSLA like model where the pricing never falls down** to natural fundamental driven levels. What if AMC keeps getting reloaded by shorters with the same investment thesis that AMC is bound to fall. As SI climbs back up, Reddit notices and it drives back up demand on this proven squeeze stock with a large community. However, AMC has no explosive growth potential since the theater business has a near realized saturation. AMC has no gigafactory or fancy roof solar panels that is beyond their core business.

AMC Squeeze Saga continues on for another six months. There is a real risk that this keeps going on for another six months where pricing never falls back down because both sides won't blink.

Conclusion:

It seems whether the third AMC squeeze happens or not, within six months (Dec or Jan strike) the pricing levels seems like it should fall. Maybe to at least the $25-35 range.

Not financial advice, don't listen to me."

# Basics

 Company Name: Popular, Inc. 

Ticker Symbol: BPOP 

Exchange: Nasdaq 

Sector: Financial Services 

Industry: Regional Banks 

Stock Price\*: $76.36

 USD Consensus Fair Value Estimate: $129.31 

 Headquarters: San Juan, Puerto Rico 

Market Cap: $6.6 Billion (“Large Core” with both growth and value characteristics) 

 Company Description: Popular, Inc. is the leading financial institution by both assets and deposits in Puerto Rico and ranks among the top 50 U.S. bank holding companies by assets. Founded in 1893, Banco Popular de Puerto Rico, Popular’s principal subsidiary, provides retail, mortgage, and commercial banking services in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Popular also offers in Puerto Rico auto and equipment leasing and financing, investment banking, broker-dealer, and insurance services through specialized subsidiaries. In the mainland United States, Popular provides retail, mortgage and commercial banking services through its New York-chartered banking subsidiary, Popular Bank, with branches located in New York, New Jersey, and Florida. 

&amp;#x200B;

#  Industry Overview &amp; Competitive Positioning 

BPOP Returns v. Industry Return: BPOP exceeded the US Banking industry, which returned 68.9% over the past year. BPOP returned 108.3% during the same timeframe. 

BPOP Returns v. Market Returns: BPOP exceeded the US Market which returned 45.5% over the past year. BPOP returned 108.3% during the same timeframe. 

Volatility: Over the past 5 years, BPOP (1.25 Beta) has been more volatile than the average market (1.0 Beta), and less volatile than the US Banking industry (1.38 Beta). 

Competitors: Compared to competitors including OFG Bancorp (OFG), First Bancorp North Carolina (FBNC), Community Bank System Inc (CBU), and US Bancorp (USB), Popular, Inc. has a lower price to earnings ratio (P/E), indicating that BPOP may be underpriced in the short-term 

&amp;#x200B;

#  Valuation &amp; Financial Analysis 

Share Price v. Fair Value: Considering BPOP’s current stock price of $76.36, BPOP may be undervalued based on the cashflows the company is expected to generate in the future. Trading below fair value indicates possible upside potential.

 Price to Earnings Ratio: Measuring the current share price relative to BPOP’s earnings per share, the company’s PE of approximately 8.61 is lower than the Industry (12) and Market (19.7), indicating BPOP is possibly undervalued. While not a measure of future performance, BPOP’s earnings growth has exceeded both the overall industry and market over the past year. Factoring BPOP’s forecasted annual earnings growth and forecasted annual revenue growth, both metrics may lag the overall industry and market over the next 3 years. 

Debt to Equity Analysis: With a Debt/Equity Ratio of 22.7% (as of March 30, 2021), there have been significant improvements since July 29, 2014 when BPOP had a Debt/Equity Ratio of 105.4%, indicating increased assets and reduced liabilities during that timeframe. Additionally, with an Assets to Equity Ratio of 11.3, BPOP is financing its operations through a moderate level of debt versus wholly-owned funds.

 Dividends: With an annual dividend amount of $1.80 per share and a dividend yield of 2.29%, BPOP’s dividend yield is in line with the market median of 2.26%. While dividend payments have been stable and increased for 5 years in a row, BPOP has only  paid a dividend for 6 consecutive years. With a low payout ratio of approximately 18.4%, BPOP’s dividend payments are well covered by earnings and future payouts to shareholders are forecasted to be well covered in the next 3 years.

stocks,"Surfing The Stock Market for fun and excitement For the purpose of this post you can call me a stock market beach bum, or bum for short.  Because what I want to describe is very much like surfing, and my role is that of a beach bum.

As a beach bum you can picture me sleeping on the beach with my surfboard.  Occasionally I may wake up and study the surf.  If it looks promising I might holler ""Surf's Up!"".  But even if I do, I may or may not decide to hop up and run out into the waves.  The point of hollering is to let the other bums on the beach know that they might want to check out the waves themselves.  There is no expectations from other bums.  They might let me know that they are headed out to catch a wave. They might not. And just like me they might holler out and yet not move. They might not feel energetic enough, or are simply need more inspiration; no expectations, no requirements.

What the heck am I talking about, right?  I am talking about something that I think many people might find to be a fun and exciting way to play the stock market.  The point of playing this way isn't to make money really, but you might just happen to do that too.  It's fun. It's exciting. It's a lot like surfing.  People (mostly) don't surf to make money either.  To ""surf the stock market"" you must wake up early, as most of the ""waves"" hit during the premarket hours.

Here's how it works:

1. When you wake up, look at what stocks are trading with the most volume and/or the biggest price changes for the day already.
2. If you find a stock that is both up by a very high percentage and that stock has significantly exceeded the average volume for the day even though the market has not opened yet, you can holler out ""surf's up!"".
3. Just like in real surfing, you then decide if or when to catch that wave, i.e. when or if you want to buy in to see how far you can ride it.
4. As soon as you buy in, look for how/when to sell. Expect your ride to be short, just like real surfing.

During premarket trading you probably cannot execute a full variety of buy/sell orders, so you definitely don't want to go big the first time you try this.  If I buy in during premarket I use a limit order with a limit price that is significantly above the last price I've seen.  That ends up acting like a market order, i.e. it gets filled quickly at the current premarket price.  Selling during premarket can be done in a similar fashion if you choose to stay awake and alert, which you probably should do. Once the market opens you can use stop limit orders if you want to fly blind, or simply keep watching and put in a market sell order when you want out.

As I said, it's exciting.  But it isn't necessarily going to make you any money. And if you buy big you could have a little too much of that excitement or dismay when you crash on the rocks. So far I've used very small quantities of money.  My goal is to see how big of percentages I can achieve.  The most exciting wave earned about 130 percent in 8 minutes when my stop triggered.  Maybe someday I will put real money into this game, but I surely won't recommend that you do."

stocks,"An in-depth guide on how to perform deep research on a stock investment opportunity Having worked for equity research desks over the last few years, I wanted to write-up my thoughts and methodology as to how I look at potential opportunities, and some of the sources you can use to help you do that.

# The initial screen

Before assessing an opportunity in great detail, I quickly look at 3 main elements:

1. **Company profile**  
What is the company? what do they do? what sector are they in? how long have they been around for? how many employees do they have?  
There isn’t anything specific i’m looking for at this stage, but I’m just building an understanding of the stock such that all research I do from then on has context behind it.
2. **The technicals and charts**  
Look at the price history of the company, what’s the 3 month, 1 year and 5 year trends? how did the price perform during previous crashes? (2008 for example) did it recover quickly? has the price been trending downwards for a while now, if so what levels could it recover to?  
For example, I use TradingView to quickly look at price history and trends, in this case for AAPL. I drew a parallel channel based on where the recent bottoms and tops have been, allowing me to see price ranges over the last 9 months. I use this as a rough guide to where the current price is at for the stock.
3. **Price upside &amp; analyst ratings**  
Analysts usually give a target price and buy rating for companies, I use this as an indicator for possible upside and overall quality. After all, these people spend all day doing this, and some of the big equity research houses can really impact a stock price based on their grading.

# The main checks

If the company passes the checks above, I move on to looking at the opportunity in more detail, looking at the following:

1. **News, coverage &amp; sentiment**  
Search the opportunity online, what are people saying about it? What recent news has it had? Read through comments on Yahoo Finance, Twitter, Reddit, StockTwits. Try and read both bullish and bearish commentary so you get a good idea for both sides of the argument.
2. **Revenue &amp; Earnings**  
This is important, ultimately, every business wants to become profitable and grow that profit year on year. Have a look through income figures and growth rates, how does it compare to competitors in the same sector? How has that fared during the pandemic? If there’s been massive growth recently, will that sustain long-term? What are analyst expectations, are they low/high? Why?  
Do the same for Revenue. This is slightly less important than income, but can start to inform you about cost bases, is the company growing revenue heavily but little profit growth? Is that investment for future profit? How long in the future? do they have a high profit margin?
3. **Financials**  
You want to assess the health of the company’s finances and balances (good EPS ratio, cashflow, debt ratios, debt maturity, quick ratio, book value etc).  
Here you are trying to assess financial red flags and signs of good capital management. Does the company have a lot of debt? is it due soon? How will this company fare during a crash? How did it manage through COVID? Does the company have enough cash to survive big losses? Does anything not add up on their balance sheet?
4. **Valuations**  
Build up an indication to how the stock is priced (PEG ratio, P/E ratio, P/CF, P/B etc, this article helps explain the ratios), is the company over-valued? under-valued? How does it compare to the market it’s in? How does it fare compared to sector competitors? Can you identify reasons for valuations? (some companies trade “at a discount“ because investors are not sure about the company’s future or management for example).
5. **Competitors &amp; Sector**  
Have a look at the direct competitors, how are they performing? are they priced similarly to your opportunity? if not, why? how does the company you’re assessing stack up? what is this company’s “moat”? what differentiates them from their rival? how hard is it to compete with this company? Look at the overall sector too, how will it fare long-term? What drivers could affect the sector?
6. **Employee ownership &amp; trading**  
Look at how much equity the employees of the company own, especially the executives, are they highly remunerated based on stock price? If they are equity weighted it’s in their best interest to increase the share price, some executives check their price every hour… Are they generally buying or selling the stock?
7. **Stock liquidity &amp; size**  
What’s the market cap of the company? Does it have sufficient volume traded? lower market cap/ volume companies are more volatile and sensitive to big trades, meaning you could lose more or not be able to get your money out quickly.
8. **Company management**  
What’s the background of the CEO and executive board? do they have sufficient experience in the sector? What do employees think of the CEO? have a look through Glassdoor for reviews on management styles and culture.
9. **Ownership structure**  
Try to assess how the company is owned and managed, what's the share structure? How many institutions hold this company? have they recently purchased or sold a large chunk? Are there large chunks of preferential shares that could impact your position or return? What’s the history of investors? Have they invested in ‘pumps and dumps’ ?
10. **Price history/ Technical analysis**  
At this point, you should have a good understanding of the company’s health, future plans, history, balance sheet and management. While all of those things could be positive, the price history of the stock could still be a blocker. Do some technical analysis on the opportunity, what’s the price history? long-term trend? RSI and stochastic indicators? MACD, bollinger bands etc.

# The unconventional checks

The above covers off a lot of the foundational and straightforward checks you should perform for any investment opportunity, and should provide you with a good starting point for you to do further research if needed.

Having said that, great research into opportunities doesn’t stop here. The above might not tell the full story, especially when you are looking at opportunities with limited history or data (penny stocks for example). In that instance, it’s necessary to do some unconventional research and think outside the box.

Some of these points are inspired by a [reddit post I found](https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/lwvisz/7_unconventional_ways_to_dd/), which I highly recommend you read.

1. **Look in places/ ask questions others won’t**  
There's always something to learn from research even if you don't end up making an investment in a company. Curiosity makes an excellent research partner.  
Try to pick out holes in the company and research, what could go wrong? what are people overlooking? What have you not covered? Does anything not feel right? Why?  
This will be difficult to do at first, as you are unsure what to cover and what feels right. The point here is, a lot of the research you do should be unsuccessful, but it helps develop your sense for the market, and will allow you to sniff out iffy looking investments/figures.
2. **If they offered you a role, would you work for them?**  
Usually you can tell alot about the company and its likelihood for success from the management team and their approach. That’s why professional institutions spend a lot of time focussing on and meeting the upper management.  
What’s their track record? How do they come across in interviews? How do they reward and talk about their employees? Would you work for them?  
Try and assess the equity structure of the company. Is the company set up in a way that it's easy to benefit the CEO, Investors and Preferred shareholders and the expense of common stockholders? Do insiders get rewarded with equity, making the success of the company their personal gain too?
3. **Model the extremes, both risk and upside**  
Try to gain an idea of what happens in the best and worst case scenario. How much could you lose and how much could you gain? Thinking like this sometimes gives you ideas of “asymmetric risk“.  
Look for opportunities where the upside/downsides are unbalanced, and structure your whole portfolio that way too (don’t lump all in on risky investments, but some potentials which could really boost gains.)
4. **Project potential, not just finances**  
One of the best performing funds for the last decade, Scottish Mortgages Investment Trust, was built on the thesis that “big changes in technology can provide large revolutions to lifestyle and capability, changing the way we live and operate“  
The notion here is that some companies can fundamentally change the game, and with it, revenue and earnings. Try to forecast Amazon’s current revenue 20 years ago, it was unthinkable for an online store. In the same way here, try to think about the potential of the company and its sector, on horizons of decades, not quarters.

# The sources

Google is your best friend here, a lot of the things you need aren’t hard to find, it’s just about knowing what words to type into the search bar!

Luckily, a few great websites exist these days that you can use:

* [Koyfin](https://app.koyfin.com/home)
* [Yahoo Finance](http://finance.yahoo.com/)
* FT Portfolio (A premium service, but well worth having for their data and news coverage)
* [Marketbeat](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/AAPL/price-target/)
* [TradingView](https://www.tradingview.com/) \- Great for technical analysis and ideas
* Wikipedia - Useful to know the company story and history
* The companies site - you’d be surprised at the number of people that have invested into a stock without having even seen their website.
* Seeking Alpha - News and commentary
* [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/) \- fantastic for education and understanding terms &amp; concepts, I find myself frequently on here remembering how certain ratios are calculated.
* [FinViz](https://finviz.com/) \- Financial screener &amp; visualizer, great for spreadsheet style analysis
* [Marketwatch](https://www.marketwatch.com/) \- Market &amp; stock data

# The conclusion

The above should hopefully provide you with a good framework of how to assess opportunities, the approach to take and types of questions you should be asking.

This will be lengthy and confusing to begin with, but the more companies you look at and assess, the quicker and easier this whole approach will become.

There are angles I haven’t covered in here, such as how to size and time opportunities, in the bigger context of how to shape up your whole portfolio. That is a whole other set of which I will leave for another time. If you are keen to read more about these, let me know!"

stocks,"Why do people choose NIO over Xpeng? Hey all, I've been long on Xpeng since late last year and keep noticing ZERO hype about it where as all the hype regarding Chinese EV players landing with NIO.

While I'm fond of both companies and think both will prove to be extremely successful and huge EV players in the next 10 years, I think ya'll need to pay attention to Xpeng moreso than NIO.

Excluding fundamentals, Xpeng has shown consistently over the past three quarters faster and more significant growth quarter to quarter, and month over month than NIO. Those numbers are pretty non-negotiable because they're statistics, not opinion. NIO is still larger, but Xpeng is rapidly catching up.

Lots of the claims I see around this sub are in regards to NIO ""being the future of Chinese ev because of luxury subscription services, battery swap options, and future expansion into European markets""...can I ask what ya'll are smoking? Xpeng is ALREADY IN NORWAY. They entered Norway last during Q4 2020. Regarding battery swap...although it leads to faster charging solutions (because of lack of charge), it's not going to be sustainable and as faster actual charging solutions become available, this NIO service will become less of an advantage. For subscription services... Cmon guys. Ya'll know that these services were exactly the reason why NIO was on the brink of bankruptcy last year? It's a EV company! Not a luxury club. I really think people are overestimating that area as a future peer-advantage.

Xpeng doesn't have to worry about any of that. They don't swap batteries, they simply altered their models to utilize LFP (Lithium phosphate batteries) instead of Lithium Ion. Lower range but faster charging and... Let's be honest. Chinese EV clients are going to be living in cities. LFP batteries with 80% the range for cheaper aren't a deal breaker by any means. Subscription services don't exist because they aren't a smart idea for EV companies, and XPENG ALREADY ENTERED THE EUROPEAN MARKET IN Q4 2020. Guys, they're already better than NIO in this area, not even counting growth potential.

Xpeng devotes more money towards R&amp;D than any of its competitors, has better tech already, and is the first EV Company to be launching a mass-produced Lidar equipped EV ever. All of this isn't including they're autonomous system with rivals Tesla and definitely exceeds NIOs tech.

So my question stands... What's with the hype of NIO  when Xpeng is the better bet?"

stocks,"The Weekly DD - Roblox (RBLX): Can it live up to the hype? One of the most anticipated IPOs of 2021 is labeled as a “children’s game”. Can Roblox live up to it’s recent hype? How does this kid’s game generate more than $1 billion in revenues over the last 12 months and grew it’s top-line revenues at over 100% from 2020 to 2021. The Weekly DD brings you a deep dive on Roblox (RBLX).

**Overview**

What exactly is Roblox (RBLX)? Roblox is an online entertainment platform where users interact with each other through something called a “metaverse”. The metaverse is a virtual space where real life and online worlds come together allowing users to engage in activities and experiences, and socialize with friends. There are two segments of users that create the ecosystem that is Roblox. The first are the content creators and developers, the second are the users/consumers who populate the metaverse and participate in said activities.

**Business Model**

Roblox relies on in-game micro-transactions to earn revenue. Users will buy items, both permanent and consumable, to enhance their accounts or the games they play. 30% of revenues are paid out to the developers of the games and the remaining goes to Roblox. For anyone doing their own analysis on Roblox I think it’s important to put a larger emphasis on “net bookings” vs “revenue” due to the way they recognize deferred vs captured revenue. Here’s a brief explanation from their investor presentation.

**Strengths**

Roblox’s strength and opportunities lie in the growth they have experienced over the last several years which saw some big tailwinds due to covid. There is still room for growth internationally and they have recently signed a deal with Tencent that will allow them to penetrate the Asian market (huge potential).

67% of their user-base is under the age of 16. Their users will eventually grow up from their teens into their twenties and capturing a more mature market will provide them with a great opportunity.

Lastly, they have the capability to not only be a gaming platform, but also dominate the virtual education scene. A transition into education would open new addressable market, which at the moment has been very limited.

**Risks**

As always, like any company there will be some risks associated to the stock performance. First, Roblox has been extremely hyped. From the IPO and ARK funds taking a stake, to Jim Cramer pumping, the company has seen good exposure and the stock price has greatly benefited.

On a more fundamental level, I thought it was interesting that a company that has been doing business for over 10 years did **not** scale that well coming off covid tailwinds. Revenue and net bookings have been growing at 140% and 160% YoY, respectively. However, their main expense buckets: cost of revenue, infrastructure costs, and development fees have been growing at almost the *same rate as revenues*.

**Final Thoughts**

Although I really like Roblox as a company, it is my opinion that the hype surrounding the name does not give a great entry point to the retail trader (at least currently). This company will be around for many more years and it will be interesting to watch how it develops. There may be better entry points down the road due to the high-volatility nature of this ticker in the post-IPO state. For a company that is still not profitable after 10 years of running and that didn’t scale as well as I thought while riding the coat tails of covid lockdowns, I will be sitting on the sidelines with my investment in this name. That doesn’t mean Roblox can’t eventually grow into their valuation. Roblox has many catalysts that I mentioned above and can possibly open a lucrative amount of addressable market for their taking. Just like anything in life, we’ll see how it goes."
stocks,"Question about taking profits... Still want the shares. A green question, but I would like to hear it explained, as I am still in the beginner's course here.

At the depth of Pandemic, I opened my RH account (I know...) and bought $100 of FORD at avg price of  7.75.

MKT value now is 185, and 86% return. I'm in this as a money maker... So does ""take the profit"" dictate taking the $85 out, so that I'm left with only the original 100 invested? Even if I want to keep some stake, and perhaps grow my position. 

I know the simple answer is to follow my own interests. But I do not have any business training, and as I'm reading and learning a lot, now (like half-Kelly, etc.) I wonder if it does make more financial sense to withdraw profits, even if I plan to re-invest in shares at a higher price.

source: https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/01/business/dealbook/robinhood-fine-ipo.html

___

Robinhood clears the decks for its I.P.O.
Robinhood racked up another big fine yesterday, this time from the financial industry regulator known as FINRA. It’s the latest blow to the online brokerage, which has faced a series of accusations of misleading and marooning customers. But the company sees an upside to its latest legal run-in, too: It believes it has resolved lingering issues enough to move forward with its long-anticipated I.P.O.

FINRA hit Robinhood with a $70 million fine, the regulator’s largest ever, for a host of sins, including giving customers wrong information about trading on margin, failing to properly determine whether customers should have been approved to trade options and not properly shoring up its technical systems to avoid a series of outages between 2018 and 2020 that led to losses for customers.

That’s on top of previous fines, including a $65 million one by the S.E.C. in December for misleading customers.

And the hits may keep on coming. Lawmakers, who pummeled Robinhood’s C.E.O., Vlad Tenev, during a hearing in February, want tougher penalties: “Robinhood won’t clean up its act with slap-on-the-wrist settlements,” Senator Elizabeth Warren tweeted. “Our regulators need to show some backbone to hold Robinhood accountable.” The company still faces several pending suits and investigations:

Massachusetts’ top securities regulator sued Robinhood earlier this year, seeking to bar the company from operating in the state because of its aggressive marketing tactics.

The S.E.C. is still reviewing the company’s role in the January meme-stock rally.

Robinhood is a defendant in dozens of potential class action lawsuits from retail traders arising from trading restrictions during the meme-stock frenzy. The cases were consolidated into a single case in South Florida and divided into four parts, including “the Robinhood tranche.” Next month, the plaintiffs must file a single combined complaint for each of the four claims — and it could drag on for a long time.

But the, uh, good news for Robinhood is that it’s moving ahead with its I.P.O., with the brokerage set to publish its prospectus imminently, DealBook’s Michael de la Merced and Erin Griffith report for The Times. Settling the FINRA investigations appears to have been the final legal hurdle that the company wanted to clear before “flipping” its hitherto confidential I.P.O. document. (Keep your eyes peeled for the rundown of the company’s legal issues in the document, which could run to novella length.) If all goes to plan, expect Robinhood’s own shares to begin trading before the August doldrums."

stocks,"DD: $WHR Whirlpool, a well Internationally-Diversified Appliance Stock Background: I originally came across this stock studying it during a project for an International Business class, and learned about how Internationally Dominant the appliance brand is. 

Markets:

[https://www.whirlpoolcorp.com/global-locations/](https://www.whirlpoolcorp.com/global-locations/) 

HQ'd in Benton Harbor Michigan, North America: has 14 Headquarters for manufacturing/distribution in North America in US, Canada, Mexico. 

Europe, Middle East, Africa: 6 plants in Italy, 3 in Poland, 4 elsewhere in the region

Latin America: 1 plant in Guatemala, 11 in South America

Asia: 4 plants in India, 4 in China, 1 in Singapore 1 AUS plant

Whirlpool is one of the most internationally dominant companies I've ever researched. It's no wonder it came up in a case study of my international business class, and as a IB major, I believe that companies like these have a huge advantage. With massive supply chains, and integration into multiple markets, stocks like these are both flexible and capable of huge earnings growth, as their dominance in larger foreign markets allows them to slowly integrate into more specialized markets.

Their PE ratio reflects this as it is trading just over a ratio of 10, but earning around 17 in it's 5 year average. A ratio of 10 is generally reasonable regardless of industry, and it's also ahead of it's dividend yield average, currently yielding at 2.57% 

With this international diversity, risk of political barriers to earnings are lower when so much of its sales are driven by foreign markets. 

Their balance sheet is also balanced with the company having a current ratio of about 1, but no huge concerns with long term debt. The company is neither under nor overleveraged in my opinion, and still has time to take advantage of cheap fed interest rates in the US

If you want a stock whose earnings is less affected by US markets, consider adding WHR to your portfolio."

stocks,"Question About the Bid/Ask Price Hi All, Apologies if this is a silly question, but I’ve researched and just can’t find a direct answer.

There have been situations when I’ve been invested in a stock and have watched the bid/ask price closely only to be confounded by the ask price’s actions. There will be situations when the ask price will refuse to budge over the last price sale. Sometimes even staying below the last sale for quite some time.

In the situations in which the ask price stays at the last sale price, it will just stay there even while quite a few sales at that price are being done, until eventually of course when a last sale price is lower and closer to the bid price, at which time the ask price just simply drops.

I understand the ask/bid price is based off supply and demand, but logic says when demand is there at that current price, ask for a little more, I just don’t get it!!  This has happened to me on stocks that were allegedly being shorted, but I wasn't sure if that would play into it.

stocks,"Connecting the Dots: My High-Conviction Bet on Paysafe (PSFE) It was evident that PSFE had finally found bottom last week.  For months, we saw all the tell-tale signs of market manipulators expertly shaking out retail shareholders with order flow, short volume, massive block trades and 13F’s showing institutions steadily loading up.  In this context, just as PSFE was to be officially added to the Russell 1000 and 3000 indexes, it seemed a little suspicious that Paysafe was suddenly being hyped and trending on WallStreetBets.  I had to wonder if this was an engineered event to generate more liquidity since market makers were clearly running out of sellers right when they had to fill a lot more institutional orders.

That’s all just monkey brain theory that ultimately doesn't matter because my plan is to hold PSFE for a long time.  There is a clear strategy with this company that will take some time to come to fruition and I want to be in on the ground floor, before all the rosy ER’s come in.  With a fintech that does roughly as much transactional volume as Square and, despite recent reports, has similar growth to PayPal, it’s no surprise that institutions want to accumulate at levels so low that the stock is almost completely de-risked from a long-term perspective.

The comprehensive DD below is for investors with a longer view who may have been caught in the recent hype. Know that you’re not alone. We saw the same thing right after CNBC’s Jim Cramer called Paysafe, “the ultimate stock for this moment” and market analyst Steve Grasso repeated his calls for it go to “$45/$50 and then settle in before moving higher from there.”  After initial spikes, deep-pocketed short-sellers methodically crushed retail holders, eventually bringing the price down to where it was last week.

But informed short sellers knew they couldn't push too far because that price was really not far from the price paid by noted fund managers like Dan Loeb (Third Point 41.5 million shares), David Tepper (Appaloosa Management, 10 million shares), Aaron Cohen (Survetta Capital, 13 million shares), Dipanjan Deb (Francisco Partners, 20 million shares) and Leon Cooperman (personally owns 1.1 million shares).  A price probably lower than paid by Wells Fargo’s several funds (12 million shares) and even by Blackstone when they raised their initial stake of 123 million shares to a total of 160 million shares.^(1)  Also, it’s worth noting that, since they all decided to invest, Paysafe has created significant value including securing new revenue streams in the US iGaming market and expanded partnerships with Coinbase, ESL Gaming, Luckbox, and Microsoft among others. ^(2)

With a presence in 120 countries, Paysafe is an extremely diversified global payment processor: #1 global leader in iGaming, #2 global digital wallet, #4 globally in integrated merchant processing. Ever since private equity groups Blackstone and CVC took Paysafe private, they’ve been going through a major restructuring to reduce risk, increase margins and profits. It's because they are still very much in the middle of that process that I like it so much as an investment opportunity. Here are a few key points:

&amp;#x200B;

* In 2017, private equity groups Blackstone and CVC raised their bid five times to ultimately to take Paysafe private for $3.9 billion.^(3)  Blackstone says their typical investment term is “upwards of 7-10 years” ^(4) which aligns with the investment time-frame implied by an inside source close to those negotiations who said, “There is a fundamental change in the way we pay for goods and services, away from the cash and cheques of our parents’ age,” adding that the private equity firms “have a decade-long thesis that this shift will only grow and grow and they want to get in now.” ^(5)
* Under Blackstone/CVC’s stewardship, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion (28% CAGR pre-Covid). Last year, due to Covid-related brick-and-mortar business and sporting event closures, along with their long-standing strategic decision to exit specific high-risk Asian revenue channels, 2020 revenue stagnated.  This is the reason they recently reported only 5% YoY quarterly growth.  In their Q1 ER, management noted that, without those channel exits they would have reported growth in the “mid to high teens.”  But even if you include 2020’s stagnant growth, their overall revenue growth since 2017 was still 18% CAGR. This is roughly the same as PayPal’s current projected growth. ^(6,7)
* A few months ago, Paysafe was brought public through a reverse merger transaction with acclaimed deal maker Bill Foley, Chairman of Fidelity. The deal paid down $1.2 billion in debt and gave Blackstone/CVC about $5.6 billion in cash and shares.^(8)  The fact that Blackstone's recent 13F shows they bought back 37 million shares, combined with statements from them and Paysafe's board, indicates that they did this deal, not for a mere 44% gain on a four year investment, but because Bill Foley is an extraordinarily successful and well-connected deal maker who has a proven track record for generating exponential growth.
* Inorganic growth through M&amp;A is a major pillar of Paysafe’s strategy going forward.  Bill Foley, now Chairman of Paysafe and a major shareholder, is a proven M&amp;A synergy wizard, particularly in the financial services arena.  Foley took Fidelity National Financial from $3 million market cap to $10.8 billion. Yeah, that’s and “m” and a “b”.  Over just the last five years, Foley grew Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun &amp; Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B).  Through his proven M&amp;A playbook, Foley also grew FIS from $2.5 billion to over $91 billion market cap. That’s a 36x return.  He says  “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” ^(6,9)

**Deleveraging, increasing margins and profit**

* Paysafe recently confirmed they are on track to meet 2021 projections of $1.53 billion in revenue, $930-$970 million in gross profit, double-digit growth and expanding 30-35% EBITDA margins, and $103 billion in transactional volume.  Paysafe’s already strong $362 million in 2020 free cash flow was reported to be on track for 29% growth in 2021.  Notably, their multi-year projections don’t include growth from their ""active M&amp;A pipeline"" and their ongoing US iGaming expansion (projected at 55% CAGR).
* Q1's earnings disappointed some because, as part of their restructuring, they had $90 million in one-time non-recurring expenses associated with the merger and paying down $1.2 billion in debt. The company noted: “Results included interest expense of $58.5 million, an increase of 53% compared to the prior year, reflecting the expense of capitalized debt fees as a result of debt repayment on March 31, 2021. Net loss also included share-based compensation of $72.4 million, compared to none in the prior year due to shares vested on completion of the Transaction.""
* Take away the $90 million in one-time expenses and, rather than reporting a $49 million loss, the company would have reported $41 million in quarterly net profit, thereby beating all analyst estimates. All signs indicate they are on track to beat estimates going forward, although I have noticed a few platforms raising those estimates recently.
* In addition to paying down $1.2 billion in debt, an improved Moody’s credit rating has enabled the company to refinance roughly a billion at a 1.25% lower interest rate, with an option to reduce it another 25bp.^(10)  Foley says: “One of the keys to this transaction and value creation for our shareholders is the reduction of Paysafe’s leverage ratio to 3.6x Debt/EBITDA.”  Notably, this Debt/EBITDA ratio is far better than the majority of their fintech peers, and the resulting improved margins stand to make it better still.
* The combined effect of overall recent debt management will be a savings of around $92 million annually.  This secures higher margins, increased cash for M&amp;A and higher profits which, in my view, will lead to raised price targets and positive price action catalysts.
* As part of their restructuring to cut down on operating expenses and further increase margins, Paysafe has recently forged agreements with Snowflake and AWS as they move to cloud-based integration for easier migration between their platforms, easier cross-border payments and planned expansion into global banking as a service, having identified a $58 trillion TAM.

**Highly competitve**

* Unlike other payment processors, Paysafecard enables those without basic ID metrics, credit cards, or even bank accounts (the 1.7 billion “unbanked” globally) to engage in eCommerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY.  Just today, Microsoft introduced Payesafecard to its Xbox platform in 22 countries.
* In various segments, Paysafe has recently expanded their partnerships with FOX bet, Roblox, Fortnight, Coinbase, Amazon, Twitch, Microsoft/Xbox, bet365, ApplePay, Draftkings, Spotify, Youtube, Visa, Betfair, PayLease, ESL Gaming, Luckbox, Amelco, BetMGM, Ceasar’s, and Pointsbet among many others.
* \#4 globally in integrated merchant processing, Paysafe’s proprietary scalable electronic payment platform was voted “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution”, “Payment Processor of the Year,” and “Best Payment Method.”
* They are #2 globally in the digital wallet space with a presence in 120 countries. They own Neteller and Skrill, which was voted “Best Digital Wallet” for “best consumer take up”, “most innovative technology” with “greatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.”
* People are usually more likely to leave reviews when a payment platform doesn’t meet their expectations. That said, Trustpilot rates Paysafecard as “Excellent” (4.7/5 stars-31,981 reviews), Paysafe’s digital wallet Skrill as “great” (4.1/5 stars-18,037 reviews) and Skrill Money Transfer as Excellent (4.8/5 stars - 8,349 reviews). ^(11)
   * By contrast, Truspilot rates Stripe as “Average 3.4/5 stars- 6,208 reviews), Venmo as “bad” (1.2/5 starts - 222 reveiews), Zelle as “bad” (1.2/5 stars - 326 reviews) and PayPal as ""bad"" (1.2/5 stars-18,555 reviews). ^(12)

&amp;#x200B;

**“At Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.”**

**“It’s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate.""** \- Bill Foley

&amp;#x200B;

* Paysafe is the #1 global leader in iGaming payment processing, a space that is extremely difficult to enter, due to managing risk and a very complex regulatory landscape. Paysafe’s advantage here is a large aspect of its MOAT, as discussed below.  Paysafe is often an integrated back-end payment processor so most don’t realize they are using it but they are already integrated with 75% of all US iGaming operators. Paysafe is actively laying the groundwork for their US expansion in the wake of a US Supreme Court decision allowing state-legalized sports betting.
* Bill Foley says, ""It’s going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else…we’re seeding the future growth right now by state and by operator... The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective... I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that’s headquartered or located in Las Vegas. There will be money to be made for everybody... We’ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It’s pretty exciting”
* In his letter to investors, fund manager Dan Loeb said, “We believe the US is poised to become the largest online gambling market globally as it begins to deregulate state by state and Paysafe is exceptionally positioned to capitalize as the global market leader.”
* Compass Point analyst Michael Del Grosso, who initiated coverage with a $19 price target, noted, “PSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States,” adding, “we believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.” ^(13)

   * RBC Capital 5-star analyst Daniel Perlin: “We believe PSFE offers a unique combination of digital wallet capabilities, accelerated cash conversion for consumers who would otherwise be out of the ecommrece loop, and integrated payments, all focused on specialized &amp; complex end-markets, which creates a competitive moat and pricing power.” “recent underperformance is largely due to the complex nature of PSFE’s business and the FTAC II transaction” and adds his view that Paysafe offers one of the best combinations of services in online payment space: “PSFE has created a unique two-sided network enabling merchants to accept online &amp; in-store payments (in specific niche verticals), while also offering consumers a digital wallet &amp; eCash solution, which converts cash-heavy users to digital users. We believe it’s this combination that enables PSFE to generate superior take rate economics vs. peers.” ^(14)
   * BMO Capital, 5-star analyst, James Fotheringham: “PSFE is a global leader in iGaming (online betting related to sports, poker, and other casino games, as well as lotteries and bingo). Indeed, 36% of PSFE’s revenues are from global iGaming. That is far more than for any of its peers.” iGaming deposit volumes in the U.S. will grow “at more than five times the rate of growth elsewhere in the world” with a ""5-year CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of between 40% to 55%."" ^(15)
   * Evercore ISI analyst David Togut 'praised Paysafe for its “robust risk management operation,” and its high rankings in several key performance indictors globally, including cash network, stored digital wallet value, and amount of partnered independent merchants.' ^(16)

**MOAT:**  **“robust risk management operation”**

So why does Paysafe dominate iGaming and why how is it able offer eCommerce services to the 1.7 billion globally who can't even manage to have bank accounts or credit cards?

Their industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant or unwilling to enter. CEO Philip McHugh from transcript : “When we talk about a deep and a wide MOAT, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit where it’s hard to copy.…We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It’s a real strength of ours. We’ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we’ve upgraded the team, we’ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.”

“We can de-risk some transactions where the market has abandoned many of these players…we bring millions of consumers into the ecosystem. We bring unique ways to pay and access funds that a typical card processor certainly can’t do. When you have that two-sided network, you change the conversation. When we speak to some of our largest iGaming customers, we’re not only talking about take rates and comps, we’re talking about revenue-generation, we’re talking about attracting the types of customers that they want and they need in their ecosystem. That’s a really, really powerful position to have.” ^(9)

&amp;#x200B;

**Valuation:**

A while back I looked at a basket of fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign.

* Paysafe reports 30%+ EBITDA margin,  mid to high teen EBITDA growth, and $362 million in free cash flow (now on track to increase 29%),
* By comparison, a third of the peer group reported negative EBITDA, half reported negative EBITDA growth, and a third negative free cash flow.
* Paysafe also has better EPS than over half the group and better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them.
* The group's collective growth rate of \~12.5% is in the range of Paysafe's 10-13% projections but the company's estimates may be intentionally conservative as they do not take into account their current expansion into US iGaming nor do they factor in their ""active M&amp;A pipeline.""  Foley is apparently known for under-promising and over-performing.
* As noted above, Paysafe was growing 28% CAGR pre-Covid, but taking into account last years slow down due to Covid-related business closures and strategic channel exits, it grew at 18% CAGR, a rate on par with PayPal's projected growth.

Given all the above factors, it seems fair to look at Paysafe's potential price based on an average of peer multiples:

Paysafe’s share price with average of sector peer multiples:

* EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09
* EV/Rev ratio : $83.91
* EV/FCF ratio : $87.86

Average: $97.95

More realistic price after removing all outliers in each category which put PSFE share price over $100

* EV/EBITDA ratio : **$50.75**
* EV/Rev ratio : **$44.64**
* EV/FCF ratio : **$44.18**

**Average : $46.52**

In a nutshell, the basket of sector peers has an average growth within Paysafe’s conservative projections yet they trade at 350-750% higher multiples. With Paysafe having better financials than most, it is hard to argue that this is proportionate. Either the entire field has to come down or Paysafe has to go up.  While I don't necessarily agree with his time frame, market analyst Steve Grasso's call for ""$45/55"" may actually be quite reasonable.

stocks,"Understanding Enterprise Value Almost everyone considers P:E when buying stock in a company, but have you considered their [EV/EBITDA](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/072715/what-considered-healthy-evebitda.asp)? One is not necessarily better than the other, but It can be very helpful to consider a companies Enterprise Value.

 

If you were considering buying 2 cars, and they both cost $30k, but one had $2000 cash in the glove compartment, and the other had $2000 in unpaid parking tickets in the glove, that would be important to you, right? If you only look at market cap and not Enterprise Value (EV), you are ignoring what's in the glove compartment.

 

Consider 2 companies with a similar market cap, say INTC ($226.7B) and CSCO ($223.4B). If you just look at their market caps, you might say they are close enough (1.5% difference) that you will just directly compare their income statements. But Cisco has $29.4B in cash and only $14.5B in debt, so when you buy their stock, you are also buying some of their cash reserves. This is included in the Enterprise Value (EV) which is $223.4B+$14.5B-$29.4B=$208.5B

Intel has $23.9B cash and $36B debt, so their EV is $226.7B+$36B-$23.9B=$238.8B

So when you consider their cash and debt, Intel can be considered 14.5% more expensive than Cisco instead of 1.5%.

 

It's not always the be all end all, but it can be very helpful to look at Enterprise Value when you are comparing stocks."

stocks,"Investing Advice So since.last November.I have started to put my savings into stocks. At first I was playing around with lots of penny stocks and having an even number of wins and losses.

But now I feel I would like to invest my money in some company/ETFs that I can really set and forget and maybe put money into some riskier growth areas.

At the moment I have money in Apple, AMD, Microsoft be it very small positions.

Then I have some money in riskier stocks but ones I believe will be go up over the next few years and these are companies I do believe in. I canrlt name them or my post gets deleted.

I can afford to add a few hundred £ each month but want that money to now go into less speculative stocks.

I've been reading on here and have heard people mention stocks like MU, AMAT and TSM.

ATM all my safe stocks are in tech companies but I would like to diversify and that's why I am looking for advice.

Many Thanks."
stocks,"Little test. I put a small amount of money into every stock Jim Cramer has pumped on Mad Money or Squawk on The Street for the last week. Now, we either love or hate cramer (i love him tbh, his coke filled rants are comedy gold) but as much as this might not be popular, his calls do seem to make a lot of sense.

I took one stock per day, the one he pumped hardest, usually on mad money. I missed a couple of shows because I watch from the UK so can only get it online through some shitty VPN.

I ended up putting a minimum of £100 and a maximum of £345 into each stock.

Anyway, here's the results; I'll start with the one he recommended first, about 9 days ago, and build up to the most recent;

    Chewy - Up 6.8%
    American Express (he pushed this hard for 3 days) - Up 1.59%
    Facebook - Up 5%
    Ford - Up 1.17%
    Citibank - Up 4.68%
    TakeTwo - Up 3.48%
    Wells Fargo - Up 0.11%

He also pumped several others, which I didn't invest in. These are;

Clean Energy, down about 50 cents, but it's a meme stock so it's unpredictable.

Kinder Morgan - He pumped this about 2 weeks ago before I started my test, it's about evens.

Perkin Elmer - He pushed this for 2 days, its up about 7 dollars.

So yeah, Jimmy C. Might not be a bad follow after all. I know he can be a bit snakey, but in reality, if I was to dump my lifes savings into the stocks that he'd been offering advice on, I'd have a return of 22% in the space of a week. That's meme stock territory gains on its own, but done with with stocks that are pretty much 'classic' low risk stocks and kinda bulletproof.

The report doesn't confirm that these are alien spaceships, but the authors don't really know for sure (at least that's what they are officialy telling).

He wrote this in 2013 and few days ago US officials have published the report.

There are more possible connections and leads to July 18th, 2021 as the date the aliens might reveal themselves: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Throawaylien/comments/o198g3/july\_18th\_connections\_and\_leads\_megalist/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Throawaylien/comments/o198g3/july_18th_connections_and_leads_megalist/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

I've noticed people beginning to think about the risk of an imminent crash lately on various finance and, uhh, stock-gambling subreddits. What stocks to buy in case there's a crash? Where is safe in a crash? That sort of thing. Take a look around, do some searches for 'crash' or 'bubble', you'll see it. A change in the mood. I track about 10+ finance forums every day, and I keep seeing it coming up every single day on daily threads and topic posts.

Of course, there are always people worrying about downside, the risks, and there are always people yelling the market is about to crash, perma-bears etc. ""Scared money don't make money"", and a stopped clock is right twice a day.  Why might this time be different? 

The backdrop
=====

The market is presently doing well following the idea of the 're-opening play' in addition to the free money fountain of central bank programs and government fiscal stimulus. However, I think the delta strain is going to prevent re-openings lasting more than a few weeks, and I think sentiment is going to turn sharply on that. 

Delta can often break past vaccines, unfortunately, and it spreads like absolute wildfire among the unvaccinated. Regardless, the EU and USA are opening up anyway! Given the R0 of 6 of delta, we should see very rapid spread when mask mandates, lockdown restrictions are removed, and people are socialising like crazy in the Summer of Hedonism. 

I would expect by end July to mid-August, delta will be causing very big problems pretty much everywhere in the world; it's established and spreading in 80+ countries already. Other strains are also a problem and we may see new variants of delta or entirely new strains showing up in the next 2-3 months. 

Do you think delta is the most deadly or infectious variant of covid we'll ever see? 

Consider: it's already about 2.5x faster spreading, more infectious in younger adults, more likely to cause symptomatic disease, new symptoms that can cause it to be misidentified, it has reduced the protectiveness of vaccines noticeably. If you look at the death/infections rate in covid-naive unvaccinated populations like Taiwan, it's potentially a lot more lethal too. That's how much covid 'improved' itself in the 12 months that constituted the bulk of its spread so far, and right now it's spreading (and getting lottery tickets to improve itself) in more people than ever. 

If it's not rapidly eliminated and has another 12 months to circulate, mutate, and continue getting stronger and work around vaccine antibodies, how bad might it become? Are state &amp; national governments in the EU &amp; US &amp; Japan etc taking actions that would eliminate covid before it gets any stronger, or taking actions that will likely allow it to continue to spread and develop?

The Bear Case
=====

My key argument: Central bank and government stimulus programs were timed and globally synchronised on the assumption of the re-opening play throughout this summer. Taxpayer funds and central bank willingness/effectiveness may be exhausted should this continue another year - or two. Does anyone think life around the world will be back to 'business as usual' by the end of summer? Or will it be still 'the end of the beginning' as delta begins to reach the people that alpha failed to reach? The liquidity trap for central banks is also a real concern as printing continues and rates stay close to zero, added to uncertainty about the security of income in many sectors. 

The number of doses of vaccine given worldwide is about 2 billion. The number of doses required to fully vaccinate the world just once is about 16 billion. Will covid continue to circulate and improve? What about new animal strains (remember the mink in Denmark?). What will happen to the stockmarkets and consumer demand in emerging markets with low levels of vaccination? 

Even if covid magically disappeared overnight in the developed world - and it won't - how can the US &amp; EU stockmarkets do well if most of the world is still being ruined by covid and new dangerous strains continue to emerge? 

Now consider: A CAPE10 PER of 38? - 38! good lord! (https://www.multpl.com/shiller-pe) - Government debts globally hitting dangerously high levels vs GDP in most developed countries? A struggling global supply chain? Stalled, chaotic re-opening plans? This re-opening can't afford to fail, but as delta arrives perfectly timed with summer re-openings and incomplete vaccination, how can it succeed? 

The world is already struggling where delta is well established this month.  https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/weekly-trends/#weekly_table . Some countries where delta is well established already: Russia, Indonesia, Bangladesh. Some countries with highly successful vaccination programs: United Kingdom, Israel, Seychelles. Sort by 'weekly case change' or 'weekly death change', ignore the small countries. Those are 'weekly' figures. Extrapolate out 6-8 weeks. 

For discussion: What do you think is going to happen here? How do you think governments will respond? How do you think the market will respond? 

Other examples
====

Consider: Taiwan, Australia, Vietnam, China, New Zealand, were successful in holding back covid for 15 months. But delta sneaked past all their defenses. Now they are engaged in various levels of restrictions to try and stop it. If they can't keep it under control, how are countries with low rates of vaccination and limited/nonexistent restrictions ever going to manage? 

And then we get into the economic costs of continuing to push hard on burned out healthcare systems, the economic costs of long covid, the economic costs of permanent damage to economies  (businesses that went bust and won't ever re-open - hospitality, tourism etc). A lot of businesses can survive a bad year. But it's been 18 months now struggling like this. How many of these businesses can survive 2, maybe 3 terrible years? How much of the economy can we afford to lose before we have a really serious crisis on our hands or permanent economic damage?

Too much like feb 2020
======

To me the whole situation today rhymes far too much with the sentiment and backdrop in February 2020. A deadly strain spreading. Market hitting new highs. Too many big countries not taking it seriously, Asia &amp; ANZ making a serious desperate attempt to stop it spiralling out of control.

The main difference with the February 2020 scenario? We're starting from a far, far, far higher point of stockmarket valuation (the SP500 is not just 'expensive', it's at the 2nd highest point of valuation ever, per CAPE10, and the highest ever in terms of broker margin, buffett ratio). 

The investor backdrop is bubbling hyper-bullish sentiment and outright gambling on most forums, manias and pump/dumps erupting multiple times a day, and bearly [!] an inkling of bearishness. Yet we're going forward from here with companies AND consumers AND governments AND central banks that have taken a balance-sheet beating for the last 15 months. We're looking at a far more deadly strain of disease that spreads faster, hits harder. We're looking at governments that have already burned out the political support and willingness-to-suffer of their populations.

This is not a recipe for success. This is a recipe for March 2020... on steroids. 

Some counter-arguments against my case
=========

&gt; ""The vaccines are effective and will bring covid to a halt"". 

By definition, disease with a natural R&gt;3 will continue to circulate even if vaccines are 66% effective against infection and 100% of the population is fully vaccinated. Contrast: The R of delta is around 6, the effectiveness of one of the best vaccines (AZN) is around 60%, and barely a handful of countries will have fully-vaccinated rates above 50% by the end of summer. 

&gt; ""Well, OK, vaccines won't stop it, but they will stop people dying of it. That's what matters. We don't lockdown for 20000 flu deaths/year.""

What we are seeing from delta is that AZN &amp; PFE/MDNA vaccines are **extremely** effective at preventing death generally, though less so in older people or immunocompromised people. I have read that a fully vaccinated 80 y/o has about the same chances vs covid as an unvaccinated 50 y/o, but I don't have the source to hand right now; sounds about right though. 

Vaccines aren't nearly so effective at stopping someone spreading covid to vulnerable members of their family. While vaccines have a wonderful effect in reducing hospitalisations too, delta hits hard and spreads fast, so hospitals are already beginning to get quite busy again as a result. The problem is that this means regular hospital operation is going to be affected. If you have a hospital full of ultra-hyper-contagious-but-not-deadly plague, you can't be doing regular surgeries etc. So people will unfortunately die from that, from delayed surgeries etc, specialities on hold to help out in the covid wards. Flu has an R around 1.5 and it slams the hospital system hard every year. An ongoing (and worsening into the end of the year) slamming of the hospital system with a mostly-non-lethal-but-still-needs-oxygen/vent disease, that spreads between wards with an R of 6, that is a different matter. There's also the issue that e.g. teachers, retail, dentists, doctors, hospital staff are simply exhausted and emotionally burned out from dealing with this. The systems are under a huge amount of pressure as it is even today. It isn't realistic to expect governments to keep saying 'tough shit', all the public 'ignoring' covid all around, while these sectors crumble under the pressure.   

&gt; ""Regardless of whether it spreads, or whether people are dying, no matter how bad it gets, governments will simply not lock down again. End of story.""

We saw in Sweden last year that if governments fail to enact a lockdown, a large part of the public will do it themselves anyway. And many businesses cannot operate at full productivity if workers keep falling ill and ending up long-term sick or in hospital, even if those workers remain alive. Many businesses cannot profitably operate on 30-50% custom. Ultimately, democratic governments cannot force you to go out and get slammed by a deadly plague providing you have enough money in the bank to avoid it. The retail &amp; hospitality economy will not prosper if the only people out shopping/eating/holidaying are those unable to afford the luxury of hiding at home from a massive covid outbreak.

Remember, whether it's 1987 or 2020, you don't get a warning before the rug gets pulled from under your feet. A trip down memory lane. https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ES4uVEcXsAEqZkT?format=jpg&amp;name=4096x4096 . https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51829852 . Not that long ago, really?

Also - ""Be Fearful When Others Are Greedy"", the sage wrote. But what does **greedy** look like? Does it look like 'my stock is worth $1m/share'? No. **Greedy** looks like this: smart, sensible, sane people saying things like 'well OK, sure this market seems pretty weird, idiots being stupid, but the music's still playing, and I think there's still time to skim a quick 5-10% and get out before it all falls apart. There will be a bit of warning before shit hits the fan; I'll run for the exit when I see it'. 

The steamroller has arrived, it is right there, towering over them, but still their eyes are on the pennies on the ground, even though they know they ought to know better. But it hasn't started squishing ... yet. Then the moment arrives, and the door for everyone to get out is...  so very narrow. Painfully mixed metaphors but you see my point.

A closing note: every day, the next major stockmarket crash always gets one day closer. It's like the theta decay on a long-dated option whose expiry date is a secret. Hardly there at all for months or years, the signal lost in the noise, then suddenly, it arrives, it's the day, and everything is gone at once. 

Stay safe everyone, get your vaccines, and don't catch the plague. The zero-th rule of making money is: be alive to enjoy it.

Popular investing platform Robinhood has agreed to pay nearly $70 million to the financial industry regulatory authority (FINRA) to settle allegations that the brokerage caused customers “widespread and significant” harm on multiple different fronts over the past few years. That is the largest financial penalty ever ordered by the organization, a non-government entity authorized by Congress to oversee hundreds of thousands of brokers across the U.S. Specifically, FINRA’s investigation found that millions of customers received false or misleading information from Robinhood on a variety of issues, including how much money customers had in their accounts, whether they could place trades on margin and more.

The inaccurate information cost customers more than $7 million, FINRA found, and Robinhood is required to pay restitution to affected users. Other allegations addressed in the settlement include that Robinhood approved risky options trades for thousands of users when it should not have and did not do enough to prevent system outages in March 2020 that adversely affected millions of users. Robinhood has invested in improving the platform and is building out its customer service team, Robinhood spokesperson Jacqueline Ortiz Ramsay writes to CNBC Make It in an emailed statement about the settlement.

“We are glad to put this matter behind us and look forward to continuing to focus on our customers and democratizing finance for all,” she says. Robinhood was launched in 2014 and attracted millions of customers, many of them first-time investors, with its easy-to-use app and industry-changing commission-free trades. But it has come under fire multiple times in the past few years, most recently during the GameStop rally earlier this year when it restricted trading. FINRA’s investigation found that Robinhood’s customer service issues go back much further. Between 2018 and 2020, for example, Robinhood failed to report tens of thousands of customer complaints to FINRA that it was required to report, the organization says.

FINRA also alleges that Robinhood has “negligently communicated false and misleading information” at different times since September 2016. Those misleading and false statements had hurt customers financially, FINRA found. The report also referenced the tragic story of a customer with details matching that of 20-year-old Alex Kearns, an investor who died by suicide in June 2020 after Robinhood showed a negative cash balance of $720,000 in his account. FINRA found that his balance was inaccurate, and that the value of his position was half of what the account displayed. While Robinhood has offered options trading since December 2017, FINRA says it has “failed to exercise due diligence before approving customers to place options trades,” relying on algorithms, rather than people, to approve customers for the risky investing move.

“As a result, Robinhood approved thousands of customers for options trading who either did not satisfy the firm’s eligibility criteria or whose accounts contained red flags indicating that options trading may not have been appropriate for them,” FINRA writes.

Finally, the company failed to supervise the technology it uses to provide its core services between January 2018 and February 2021, resulting in a series of outages and systems failures. One of these outages occurred on March 2 and March 3, 2020, during extreme market volatility. FINRA says these outages cost certain individual customers tens of thousands of dollars. Robinhood did not admit nor deny the charges, and it still under investigation by the SEC. On Wednesday, the company published a blog post to highlight the changes it has implemented to address customer concerns."
stocks,"Do all brokers charge for buying dtocks? So I'm still extremely new to investing, and I signednup for an account with Hargreaves Lansdown and put £100 into the account. But before I actually went to buy any stock I noticed that they charged £10 for each transaction. And I wasn't going to buy stock from a single company, I was going to buy some from multiple, but then thay would mean I would lose like 40% of the money I put into my investing pot. This seems very expensive, probably not a big deal for people who have been investing for a while or have just have more money, but I'm not super well off and that is a fairly large sum of money for me to just lose like that.

TL;DR tickers: TSLA, ARKX, ROKT, UFO, INTEQ, IRDM, ASTS

We can’t invest in Starlink, and I wish we could. I’m looking for stocks &amp; ETFs to benefit from Starlink and Starship. I am holding $TSLA IPO, and that’s good stuff.

First the ETFs. $ARKX. Kind of some out of the box choices, but it is clearly built around Starship being a big deal in coming years. Space will be much cheaper. I also have $ROKT &amp; $UFO. Those aren’t geared around Starlink, but I want to own space stocks.

$GOGO. They sold their commercial aviation division to Iridium ($INTEQ.) The bankruptcy court approved INTEQ buying the division. I bought some INTEQ on the cheap, even though I know better than to buy a stock while in bankruptcy. (INTEQ is a huge government and military space server provider with lots of assets in orbit, btw.) Anyway, GOGO now only services private jets.  With no space assets and a dominant position for cell data, they could greatly benefit from Starlink.

While looking for Starlink plays, I found some stocks that seem to be outside of the reach of Starlink.

$IRDM. Iridium does old school sat phones. Pretty amazing for data emergencies if you are at sea or hiking on a mountain. These are places Starlink cannot cover well.

$ASTS. These cats are trying to send normal cell signals from satellites. Best I can tell, the tech looks legit. If it works, it will be very valuable. In fact, it will kill $IRDM, probably. I do not know if it will work, so this is a gamble. Worth the gamble, I think.

Got any other ideas for tickers that will greatly benefit from or immune to Starlink and SpaceX? Please share."

# Risks

The company is witnessing inflation related to raw materials. During January and February 2021, commodity costs grew to its all-time high. The company is encountering supply-related challenges with respect to some of the products including OSB, plywood, lumber and particleboard, thereby leading to the price hike.

Although the demand for single-family residential housing remained very high, the company faced troubles meeting those demands due to labour and material-availability constraints.

The company witnessed volatility in the lumber market throughout 2020. Being a nationwide supplier of building material, the company is very susceptible to fluctuations in market prices for such commodities."
stocks,"Is selling covered calls until assigned a way to get a small discount in price? Lets say I have $10,000 that I want to invest into MU. I don't believe in timing the market short term, so I am fully prepared to purchase 100 shares today at current price. I believe in their value or whatever.

Would it not always be best to just sell slightly OTM weekly puts until it drops a tad and I get assigned? If I was going to purchase and hold at the current price anyways, then me getting assigned at a lower price with premium would be better than if I bought now. However, if it expires worthless, I just collect premium, but that is a pretty decent return because it was only a barely OTM put. Seems like an easy way to get a 4-5% discount on stocks if you were 100% committed to holding for years after purchase. Only downside would be if the stock rockets up in a week and never returns to that value, but that seems like a smaller risk I'd be willing to take. Am I missing something?"

stocks,"Making money by inverting negative sentiment created by stock bashing and trolling This works particularly well for penny stocks which are more prone to rapid sentiment changes and price swings.

I found a trend. I tested it out. It actually worked out well for me several times now. But it’s a really difficult strategy to execute.

My theory was that you can identify a good entry point in a stock based on a negative change in online sentiment which is NOT correlated to company news and updates or market performance etc.

I believed that if the online sentiment changed to a negative one overall without there being an underlying reason, that it was a good sign that people shorting the stock were anxious to keep the price down and others were bashing it online to get a better entry point.

My theory is that the bashing behaviour doesn’t occur at random. It occurs strategically.

If people know the share price is going to go up in the mid term and want to keep it quiet to get a better entry point there are going to be some people who attack the stock online to try to bring the price down to give themselves more time for a lower buy in point.

If people have been shorting a stock and need time to exit their positions as they are anticipating a rise in share price they will be inclined to do the same as well.

So, in a way, online stock bashing could be seen as an inverse indicator of the current overall expectations of the actual future share price.

Here’s how the strategy works. Use websites that provide indicators of stock sentiment on social media. Pick out companies which have recently had strong negative sentiment. Figure out if there is a valid reason for the change in sentiment based on publicly available information about the company.

If nothing has changed in the companys underlying performance and they were in an uptrend before the negative sentiment began, begin to investigate the nature of the online sentiment.

Go on Reddit, Stocktwits or Twitter and actually read through all the comments you can find. Check to see whether or not the negative comments are baseless.

If the sentiment of the stock online is negative for a good reason, such as anticipating a logical negative outcome, then stay away.

If the comments bashing the stock are baseless and can’t be backed up by logic, fact or reasonable predictions then you probably have a winner.

Unfortunately this strategy can be stressful. You have to read a lot of negativity. You have to think critically and have extensive knowledge of how the market and businesses work. You have to be able to discern bullshit and emotional statements from logic. You have to be able to tell the difference between genuine criticism of a company’s performance and false criticism which can sound logical but often skews the facts to try to generate a negative view of the company. But those types of statements won’t stand up to solid research on the company.

If a stock is being heavily attacked online using flawed logic and emotional statements and there are no red flags about the company other than a recent change in share price caused by the above bashing and trolling behaviours then you probably have a good buy in point as the stock will now have an unfair lower price point caused exclusively by bashers.

If you strongly believe this is the case and there is no discernible grey area after solid investigation, just buy the stock. Ignore websites that give price targets as those are always generated based on existing numbers including the dips caused by bashing.

You have to be willing to hold until the bashing behaviour subsides or until the company’s performance proves them wrong. Once it does and investor sentiment returns to the norm you will gain by the artificial price suppression being lifted. In addition, companies being bashed like this usually have something going for them so you can capitalize on their progress at the same time.

I guess you could say this strategy basically takes advantage of trolls and bashers and uses the price suppression resulting from their online behaviour as leverage to amplify your gains."
stocks,"100% of school buses could be electric within 15 years: Lion Electric VP Add the funding from the “infrastructure” bill and the buses should start rolling!

Electric school buses may be the next wave of EVs to hit the commercial market, one executive within the industry says.
Patrick Gervais, Lion Electric (LEV) VP of marketing and communication, discussed the progress made with electric vehicles on a Yahoo Finance Live segment Tuesday afternoon.
“I think there’s a really good intention to electrify 100% of school buses within the next couple of years,” Gervais said. “We could feel the hype all across the United States. I mean, we’ve delivered buses in New York, in Minnesota, all across the country.”
The infrastructure bill, which is supported by President Biden, is expected to provide an additional $15 billion to electric vehicles infrastructure. Under the framework of the bill,  $7.5 billion is to be allocated to schools and public transit organizations to help convert to electric buses.
Gervais noted that a transition to electric school buses would have a plethora of benefits besides a reduction in carbon emissions. “There’s no noise pollution, so it’s more quiet and the kids are more calm and more concentrated when they go to school,” he said. “These are the kids and the people of tomorrow [who] will drive electric cars in the future.”
Currently, less than 1% of school buses are electric. Over 400,000 school buses drive over 3.5 billion miles each year, according to a Bellwether Education Partners study. The transition to electric buses will take initiative, but with the right moves, Gervais said, the entirety of the US school bus fleet could be electrified in 10-15 years.
Abroad, electric vehicles have sparked the interest of consumers of late — 11% of the 11.6 million new cars registered in the EU, Iceland, Norway and Britain last year were either fully electric or plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. Meanwhile, EVs and plug-ins accounted for less than 3% of new car sales in the United States.

Stocks traded mixed today, with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) rising while the Nasdaq (QQQ) fell modestly after hitting record highs for many consecutives days. In short, stocks continue to hover near record highs. Market participants are encouraged a stronger-than-expected gain on private payrolls and tempered inflationary fears.

Consumer confidence has also risen and pointed to Americans' increased propensity to spend, with the Conference Board's consumer confidence index racing to its highest level since February 2020. 

David Lefkowitz, UBS Global Wealth Management Head of Equities, said “If you look at what's really been powering the economy and powering the stock market, it's been the fact that there's been so much fiscal stimulus poured into the economy. What's really crucial though is that a lot of that fiscal stimulus has actually not been spent this year. It's sitting on the balance sheets of consumers."" I totally agree. Consumer spending accounts for roughly 70% of US GDP. Now that the economy is reopening thanks to effective distribution of the vaccine, I expect saving-laden consumers to step out and spend big this summer after enduring social distancing guidelines for more than a year. 

Today marks the last trading session of the second quarter of the year, so I thought it would be useful to take a look back at the performance of different assets since March. Year-to-date through Tuesday's close, the S&amp;P 500 has increased 14.3%, the Nasdaq by 12.7% and the Dow by 12%. The 10-year Treasury yield hit a year-to-date peak of 1.77% in March but is on track to end the quarter yielding just under 1.5%. The West Texas intermediate crude oil rebounded by 23% as demand for energy picks up. Digital currencies, on the other hand, had a very difficult quarter, with prices sharply down across the board compared to the beginning of the quarter. 

**Highlights**

* Pending home sales were up 8% in May month-on-month, helping reverse April's 4.4% drop, according to data from the National Association of Realtors. This brought the pending home sales index to 114.7, or the highest reading for the month of May since 2005. 
* Chinese ride-hailing giant Didi (DIDI) began trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The company sold 316.8 million shares to raise $4.4 billion, making it one of the largest initial public offerings of a Chinese company in the U.S. since Alibaba's (BABA) $25 billion listing in 2014. Trading began trading at $18, roughly 29% higher than its $14 IPO price, though throughout the session the stock lost most of its IPO gains. 
* General Mills (GIS) said it is raising prices across nearly all its grocery categories by around 7% due to higher costs for ingredients and labor. 
* Ford Motor (F) said it will be forced to cut output across more than a half-dozen U.S. factories in July due to continued pressure from the global shortage in semiconductors.
* PayPal (PYPL) is intensifying competition with Square (SQ) by launching its own physical card reader to put in stores. While both are undisputed leaders in fin-tech, PYPL has always focused more intensely on peer-to-peer transactions while SQ put more of an emphasis on consumer-to-business transactions.
* Twitter Inc on Tuesday named Sarah Personette as chief customer officer to oversee the social media platform's global ad sales, global content partnerships and revenue operations. The company has been making a big push to increase revenue lately. 
* **\*\*Current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\*\***

stocks,"Would it be better to automate or manually select the securities in my Roth IRA portfolio? Title. I threw this on the PF sub but wanted to ask your thoughts here, too.

I'm 18 and banking with Wells Fargo - my money has a lot of time to sit. Because of that, I suppose I'd be more comfortable with risk, but sometimes I get FOMO: maybe I'll miss out on a better ETF, stock, etc. that an algorithm would have picked up on. (As for indexes, I don't have the kind of money to buy more than 4 shares of S&amp;P directly lol. I was more so contemplating and comparing all the ETFs that track an index/mutual funds, for example. And obviously there are so many of those.)

I also have the option to mix automation and manual trading and delegate a certain amount of money to each type of trading per year. What to do?"

stocks,"What's up with IPOs and how did I shoot myself in the foot? Ok, so, I only started actively investing in April of this year and only $25 a paycheck, because you know, don't invest more than you can stand to lose. I check the Nasdaq's IPO calendar every so often and saw LegalZoom just waiting to be picked up today. I'm not very analytical in my approach to stocks at the moment because there is so much to learn/know, and even then it's a bit of a crap shoot.

So, I saw LZ on robinhood this morning with a price of $28.00. I put a limit order in at 9AM for a few shares at $28.00 because it wasn't actively being traded yet. So I check in a short time ago to look at something else and see that the order wasn't executed and the price jumped to roughly $36.

Can someone kindly explain to me what happened? If the initial price listed was $28.00, then why wasn't it executed at $28 when it was open for trade?"

stocks,"21 decisions to sell, got almost all of them wrong I've always suspected that one of the most costly mistakes I've made when investing has been selling prematurely, but I never dug through my data to determine if that was actually true.  So I decided to do that.  I went back over 21 separate decisions I've made to sell stocks over the past 12-18 months to see what happened in the months after the sales.

None of these were short-term trades, they were all intended to be long-term investments when I bought them but ended up deciding to sell.  Sometimes it was based on technical signals (new downtrends, violation of the 50 day moving average, price running up too fast and getting over-extended beyond the 50 DMA) but other times it was based on concerns about valuation.  Sometimes it was pure impatience, getting frustrated with a stock going nowhere and wanting to find a better opportunity.

Out of the 21 sell decisions, 18 of them turned out to be wrong in the sense that the price ended up higher than my sell price within the ensuing weeks and months.  In only 3 of the 21 cases did the decision to sell turn out to be a good one.  But the important thing is what I can learn from this to improve my decisions in the future.  Here are some observations:

1) A break below the 50 day moving average is a very unreliable sell signal, especially if the stock remains in a longer term uptrend.  Price dropping below the 50 DMA theoretically signals a change in the medium term trend, which could foretell the beginning of a longer term downtrend.  But in almost every case where I sold after the stock dropped below the 50 DMA, it reversed course within days and continued up.  The only case where this turned out to be a good signal was when the stock traded below the 50 DMA for several weeks.

2) Don't sell stocks based on concern about valuation.  Valuing stocks isn't an exact science; I'm not a professional and even professionals can have very different opinions about the fair value of a stock.  In every single case where I sold because I thought the stock got ""overvalued,"" it continued climbing.  This is where some of my biggest mistakes happened in terms of lost profits.  For example, I sold APPS last October for a 6x return at $32 only to watch it hit $100 within 5 months.

3) Selling when the stock dropped was always a mistake.  This overlaps with (1) because the drops typically coincided with a technical signal (breaking below the 50 DMA or breaking a support level), but every time that happened the stock reversed course soon after.  Unless the selloff reflects an underlying change in the long-term prospects for the business, you should be taking advantage of drops to buy not sell.

To be fair to myself, some of these decisions could have turned out to be correct if I moved the money elsewhere and saw better returns than if I had left the money where it was.  But the results clearly show that premature selling is a costly mistake."
stocks,"Polish company ""BLO"" informed today about the cooperation with KONAMI. What can we expect?

stocks,"WTF are these companies? I'm new to stocks. With that said:

&amp;#x200B;

I've seen a bunch of random tickers on Yahoo Finance that I've never heard of. Now I'm not aware of all the industries in the world and the companies in these industries, so that could be one reason as to why I find these tickers/companies random. But I can't help but to have a weird impression of these companies. They feel like they are shell companies, pump and dump schemes, with no real value to offer. For instance CUEN (Cuentas Inc.). Their financials look bad with declining revenue and increasing  negative earnings. Yet their stock is up over 130% today. Besides, when I change the interval to maximum I see that what looks like a short squeeze in October 1st 2010 where it cost $600,000. Was their shares outstanding really low? Like say 100 shares outstanding? Can a public company have that low of shares outstanding? Or was their shares outstanding about the same as now, 13.83M? If so, then they'd be valued at roughly $8.3 trillion which doesn't make sense, since there were no trillion dollar company back then. Are there really shell companies in the public exchanges?"
stocks,"EBITDA- what are your thoughts about it? EBITDA - Earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization, considered a controversial financial metric because it hides capex and basically eliminates the losing value of company assets.

On the other hand it's one of the most accepted metric today, every article will use it and mention it, investors comparing companies EBITDA and a lot of companies mention it in their financial statements. 
What are your thoughts about EBITDA? are you using it for your DD?"
stocks,"Last March during covid crash I purchased DAL and UAL now I am up 60-80%, they have yet to fully recover to pre covid, should I wait or sell So last March I first started to invest, I bought to some dividend stocks as well as covid crash such as CCL, FL and as mentioned the airlines Delta and United airlines. I am up 60-80% on both. It’s not a lot of money as I have about 20 of each but it’s a lot to me. Being that neither pay a dividend and I have already achieved pretty good growth in the recovery would it be wise to cash out now and move the funds to something more stable. Airlines have yet to reach pre covid numbers but with all the talk about a possible future crash coming It might be wise to exit these positions and look to buy the dip again. I know there is no right answer here but just trying to get a feel from the community. And if I sell I could get into VTO/ VOO or add to my dividend portfolio. Only thing is dividend stocks (as well as everything else) also took a massive hit last drop. I know that there likely won’t be as big a loss as covid times but would I really be doing anything for myself if I get out of airlines and travel and go immediately   into something else? I do want to keep my money in the market."

stocks,"Virgin Orbit Successful Launch Virgin Orbit successfully launched its first commercial satellites into space this morning. This following the recent approval from the FAA for the first commercial space flight license. 

The race between Branson and Bezos has been publicized and recently there is speculation that Branson is quietly looking to edge out Branson for the first to fly. 

Albeit that Branson’s attempt to fly first seemed highly speculative at the first announcement of Bezos flying it now seems like a fair expectation as there have been numerous well publicized articles declaring Branson’s secret ambition. According to SEC regulations that would require denial or clarification on part of SPCE, whom has not declared it false and ambiguously announced a flight without a passenger list. 

Aside from the ambiguity on part of SPCE it has several well timed catalysts that have come to fruition over the last couple months. This is speculation yes, however, it is becoming tangible in numerous ways.

stocks,"PAVMZ warrants…what to do? 
I currently own 8,000 PAVMZ warrants in my traditional IRA purchased at $0.75 each. Each warrant allows me to purchase one share of PAVM at a price of $1.60; the warrants expire in 2024. From what I can tell, there is no cashless exercise provision.

While I’m currently enjoying the fact that my warrant purchase has provided me with a 535% return (as of today), I’m trying to work out my strategy when the warrants are either called by the company or when 2024 arrives, whichever comes first. I am bullish on PAVM. 

Let’s assume that PAVM goes to $10 a share, and PAVMZ reaches $8.40 at the same time. The way I see it, I can either a) pay the $12,800 to exercise the warrants and ride with 8,000 shares of PAVM stock at $1.60, or b) sell the warrants for $67,200 and buy 6,720 shares of PAVM. 

Questions:

- Are these my only two options? Am I overlooking other options?
- If I exercise the warrants, would the $12,800 come out of my IRA balance, or would I have to pony that up from my checking account?"

stocks,"Looking to a pullback &amp; beyond   

Been reading recently of how many Redditers are advocating for another pullback/recession given the amount of money sloshing around the economy or the various deadly Covid variations making the rounds of other countries or some combination of both. Some Redditers, even though rather aggressive have a lot of good points.  Not saying they are wrong, but it would seem time to take prudent steps to get your portfolio in order and shake loose some money.

Unfortunately all of them seem to be firmly glued to extremes - either sell everything now and sit on cash or keep money in the market until the very last second and then pull it all out of the market in the nick of time (never worked for me). I am working a different angle that is a longer game.

What both approaches above share is buy once then forget until panicked selling. Admittedly it uses less time lurching into buying and then lunging into selling than my method. 

I buy dividend stocks so that I can watch my money grow with or without a recession. Not saying never participated in the occasional rocket:  jail stock, health stock or  gaming stock. Just went in for a quick profit on the meme's and was out. Quick &amp; clean. But the dividend stocks are treated differently.

After doing DD, I closely monitor these stocks for their price movement after I buy them. When I initially buy it is a small amount - \~ 40% of what I ultimately want to own. I keep this as a core position then trade in the stock - buying when it has a pull back and selling when the trading position goes higher. My ultimate goal is to own these dividend stocks at a average cost of less than $3-$5/share in less than 3 years.

Using this method, I own a good handful of stocks at less than $3/share which makes just about any crash meaningless to these stocks in my portfolio. So far have used this method on ¼ of the  stocks in portfolio. Stocks have done this to include: 

AES - avg. cost $3.57 \[did have a cost basis of zero, then a buying opp occurred\] - Currently selling for $26.25

CVA - avg. cost $.46 \[ yeah that is correct 46 cents\] Currently selling for $17.47.

CC - avg cost $8.75 \[still working on this one\] Currently selling for $34.64.

CWEN - avg cost $10.46 \[still working on this one\] Currently selling for $26.67.

HEES - avg. cost $13.20 \[still working on this one\] Currently selling for $33.24.

HASI - avg. cost $.74 Currently selling for $56.73.

HTGC - avg. cost $6.33 \[still working on this one\] Currently selling for $17.01

IIPR - avg cost $24.62 \[afraid that is about as good as this will get\] Currently selling for $193.55.

RF - avg cost $1.21 Currently selling for $20.08.

SPTN - avg. cost $.124 Currently selling for $18.79

SKT - $7.57 \[ still working on this one. Bought stock 4 months before became a momentary meme stock. Thanks Redditers for making this a meme stock one time\] Currently selling for $18.79.

The bulk of my portfolio are made up of stocks like MAIN, FE, ET, ETRN, IRM, etc that were bought at decent to good prices and am looking for a correction/recession to add to them. With the stocks I have gotten down in price recently - CVA, CC, RF, SPTN I have a pretty good head start on cash that has been freed up to indulge the other dividend stocks I own and get their cost down.

There is just something, to me, about having a stock that has a YOC of 190% (HASI) \[$.74 (stock price)/by $1.40 (yearly dividend)\] that makes me smile at night when I go to sleep."

The consensus call on Wall Street is that the EV pioneer delivered about 201,000 vehicles in the second quarter, but expectations might be creeping upward. “We believe 200,000 is the line in the sand and right now it’s biased upside given stronger Europe and China demand,” Wedbush analyst Dan Ives told Barron’s.

stocks,"UK platforms for stock investing Anyone know of any good UK platforms (besides Freetrade. I use them right now but they keep on sectioning off different stocks to higher paying members, which is annoying) that one can use in relation to investing, whether that's as an individual retail investor, or working with a particular fund of sorts.

Main things that I'm looking for:

1) Relatively low trading/commission fees or membership costs

2) A platform that has many, as well as a wide variety of ETFs, and US and UK listed stocks and shares. These shares would ideally be well organised and categorised as well, or the platform would at least enable users to make their own categories and lists on the app/website

3) Reputable and reliable. This platform doesn't attempt to pull fast ones on heavily traded stocks, and it also protects its investors via different regulations, insurance policies etc

4) Something where it's relatively quick and simple to liquidate funds

Any help would be sweet, thanks."
stocks,"What is a publicly traded company that is analogous to Aldi? I have a personal opinion/belief that the inflation we’re seeing is not transitory and that the Fed is in a self created trap with the inability to raise rates in any meaningful way.  Food price inflation plus any slowdown in the economy post helicopter money should mean lots of shoppers head down market into discount grocers. We’ve already seen this play out with the rise of the dollar stores over the past several years.  I would love to be able to invest in Aldi right now as I think they’re very well positioned for an inflationary market but they’re a private company. I’d love to hear if there are other public discount grocery plays, or private label/generic food companies you think are poised to do well in this market."

stocks,"What is going on with Cigna (CI) I've bought and sold and bought CI at a loss and am continuing to watch.  The company profile is decent, growth prospects are good and it's trading at a low P/E.  Research shows good growth prospects and there's a small dividend for the stock.  But I watch it continue to take a downward trajectory.  Analysts give it a green light.  It seems to defy all the publicly available research.

UNLESS there is something else going on that nobody is publicly relaying or I have missed.  Does anyone know if there are struggles within this company that I can't find?  This stock doesn't make sense to me.  

Discosure: I currently own the stock and re-bought back in about 1% loss ago after pulling out of a 5% loss previously and watching it go down further.  Thought I found a good re-entry.  Maybe not.  

Might update if there's a 5% move either way."
stocks,"Trading with technical analysis vs investing with fundamentals Good morning! 

I was just scrolling the sub and noticed a handful of people talking shit on technical analysis, it doesn’t work, it has never been proven to work, etc..

I want all you TA bashers to know that you don’t know what you’re talking about. 

There are some aspects of TA that I deem utterly useless like “head and shoulders” or “cup and handle”. 

As far as the basics go, like channel trading, support and resistances, rsi indicator, these things are incredibly accurate if you have a solid game plan of entries, exits, and stop losses.

I have a watchlist of about 150 stocks that I believe are fundamentally solid that I have been trading in and out of for years. Made almost 400% last year and i’m up over 100% this year even though my trading has drastically slowed.

For those of you that think TA is just squiggly lines on a chalkboard, you are very wrong. I have roughly 3 years worth of proof  and so do many others that know how to use it correctly and manage their risk exposure."

stocks,"Sentinel One - This will go HAM I have experience in the cyber-security industry.

Crowdstrike stands in a league of it's own.  That's why they are valued at like $58 billion.  They use a threatgraph of all their clients endpoints meta data, storing only meta data (like, this person opened a word document), and have the second largest data footprint on AWS (Netflix is #1...with movies...and insanely huge ops).

SentinelOne has a similar approach.  The platform is slick, has a nice Ui, and is created by israeli cybersecurity experts.  It has less data to work with to correlate attacks, but still has amazing potential as they have huge clients (think, one used to be the biggest company in the world...). It works on LINUX (servers!) which is a huge advantage, because CrowdStrike does not.  However, they don't use in-person threat hunting (or it is not quite as developed) they use Ai threat-hunting (most deem inferior, but still amazing and comparable efficacy).

100+% revenue growth YOY, $135Mish revenue.  Coming out valued at approx $8B, vs CS's $58B.

one of maybe 3 total solutions that are truly effective against ransomware on endpoints at the highest level (think, S1, crowdstrike, and carbon black).

it's cheaper than crowdstrike, and crowdstrike is expensive, but a more hollistic platform.  S1 will be for companies that want to save some money but still get top tier endpoint protection, and will eventually compete head to head as the sole challenger.  Also some clients like the ability to have endpoint protection for servers running on linux, not sure if crowdstrike has that yet. Think, Mercedes vs BMW.  

My personal price target (maybe 40-50 per share) before I think it's over valued is $25B mkt cap, so I think this is a decent 2x play over the next year, possibly more if Biden admin invests more and more in cybersecurity, since S1 and CS are the two best solutions, and both are used by govt. already."

The alternative would be to sell shares to pay back the margin and free up sufficient cash to purchase the OTC shares, then re-buy the marginable shares on margin (assuming it's permissible to take on margin debt while owning OTC shares). This would cause a taxable event I'd prefer to postpone.

Had the business/investment not failed the money could've remained tied up for years making so-so returns.

stocks,"Long term company research &amp; analysis on SoFi (filter through the noise) I’ve seen a ton of posts about trading SOFI and short squeezes etc. but I’m investing in SoFi for the LONG TERM and here’s why:

1. SoFi actually had positive EBITDA in Q1 and is forecasting $27M in EBITDA for 2021! How many high growth, recent IPO’s can say that!  SoFi is forecasting $254M EBITDA in ’22, $484M ’23 ($1.17B in ’25 but that’s a bit of a wild card since it’s so far in the future…).  That’s a 162% CAGR over 3 years and 113% CAGR over 5.  They exceeded guidance in Q4’20 and in Q1’21 !!!  Their forecast is also somewhat conservative since it excludes the impact of the pending bank charter acquisition which could increase these #’s.  It also excludes some of the new offerings that were just announced like Auto Loans and IPO investing (underwriting).  
2. Rapid revenue and customer growth! Forecast of $980M in 2021 to $2.1B in 2023 is a 29% CAGR over 3 years (28% CAGR over 5 years).  2.28M unique customers in Q1 and targeting 3M customers by the end of 2021.  They have a great track record of upselling existing customers (very low cost to upsell vs. acquire) with about 1/4 of their customers using multiple products, this should only improve as they add more product lines (like auto loans…and hopefully options soon!)
3. Galileo technology platform actually turns a major cost center into a profit center and makes them a true Fintech vs. just an online bank like Ally etc.  Galileo is expected to grow 55% CAGR from 2020-2025 with an estimated 62% margin.  This gives them a great B2B model and de-risks a 100% banking model.  Galileo is the Fintech engine behind 70M accounts (Q1 #’s) and customers include Robinhood, Chime, Monzo, Revolt etc. Galileo’s APIs power functionalities including account set-up, funding, direct deposit, ACH transfer, IVR, early paycheck direct deposit, bill pay, transaction notifications, check balance, and point of sale authorization as well as dozens of other capabilities. 
4. Future bank charter with the pending acquisition of Golden Pacific Bancorp will help juice profitability and revenue growth and lowers their cost of capital.  This is expected to grow profits from $484M in 2023 to $718M in 2023.  If their estimates are correct AND the acquisition goes through that would increase the 3-year earnings CAGR from 162% up to 198%!  This deal should close by the end of 2021
5. Solid leadership:  Anthony Noto, CEO has a strong background in Finance with Goldman Sachs and the NFL (CFO) AND Technology from Twitter (COO).  Chris Lapointe, CFO also has a great mix of Tech (Uber) and finance from Goldman Sachs.  Similar story with the rest of the executive team.  Strong marketing with SoFi stadium in LA (Superbowl venue) and SoFi’s investment team is frequently on CNBC (Liz Young etc.)
6. Rising interest rates is actually POSITIVE for SoFi!  Banks pay customers a relatively low interest rate on short term deposits and charge customers a higher interest rate on longer term loans.  As rates rise their margins increase.  With rates at record lows, a rapidly recovering economy and inflation on the horizon rates should only go higher (maybe substantially and much faster than normal).  The bank charter only enhances this….
7. I invested a little in SoFi (via IPOE) originally after it pulled back and wanted to invest more BUT before I did, I opened accounts at SoFi to verify that it’s all that they say it is.  So I opened a checking account, 2% cash back credit card, active investing account, automated investing account.  This is the real deal:  Products are SUPER competitive (2% cash back on a CC with NO annual fee!), Checking account pays 0.25% with no fees, $0 stock trades for active investing and direct access to IPOs (I participated in their 1st 4 IPOs today - 6/29) and no cost automated advisor investing.  They really treat you like a “member” and customer service has been great so far.  The mobile App is very user friendly with a ton of added features (credit score, education etc.).  
   1. If you own SoFi stock for the long term and you’re not a customer yet – you’re doing yourself a disservice.  You are an owner in the company and you should be profiting from your own banking!  Try them – you’ll love them and start consolidating all your accounts to them like I am.  
8. Post lockup period (ended Monday 6/28) we should see a lot more interest from  ETFs, Mutual Funds, Institutional investors and analysts.   Volume should dissipate and the stock held its ground even with 50M shares trading a day (10X normal volume). There is a ton of demand for not only high growth but also PROFITABLE companies and FinTech specifically.   Based on their market cap and projections for profitability they should be added to the Russell indexes next year and possibly the S&amp;P Indexes if they can meet the profitability criteria etc. 

Analyst Price Targets:

Oppenheimer:  Overweight $30 Price Target

Rosenblatt = BUY $25 Price Target

I personally don’t follow Analysts too closely but it does drive institutional investor buying and helps give you a sanity check. 

Based on the multiples of other FinTechs my price target is $50 in 3 years assuming they hit their guidance.  

There are obvious risks if multiples come down or if they miss their targets and there is a very high short interest right now but so far they have delivered on all their guidance and growth.  

I’ve seen a ton of posts on SoFi trading with a lot of hopes and dreams of a quick hit or WSB pushing it higher and that’s not why I put my money into SoFi over the past few months.  I’m an investor not a gambler...but I have been buying some of the dips when it does on sale.

Disclosure:  I’m long SoFI and it’s my largest holding.  I continue to buy more on dips and plan to add more in general as they meet their targets and goals, release new products.  I clearly have a vested interest in SoFi going higher but I wanted to share some of the research on the company vs. all the hype that's flying out there right now."
stocks,"My long as hell, silver DD Sorry this is a bit long winded, but I wanted to put out my entire investment case for silver, maybe just to feel better about having invested most of my life savings into it. I own silver mining stocks, ETF's, and options, but this is the case that ties them together. This is just my opinion. Do you own research, since I’m not qualified or interested in, giving investment advice.

**Supply**

First, it’s important to consider that silver is not like other commodities. It sounds kind of silly, but if we were talking about wheat, oil or pork bellies, the supply and demand would have to match, in the long term and the short term. Gold and silver are mostly valued based on existing stockpiles. They have been mined for thousands of years, and for most of that time, excluding the last 150 or so years, almost everything ever mined was still in some sort of usable form. This is why these metals can act differently than almost other commodities. If the price of corn spiked higher, farmers would switch crops to farm more, and it would eventually correct the price to the cost of production and a reasonable profit margin. Gold or silver could go for a long time being too expensive or too cheap, and it wouldn't immediately correct itself, since the price is based more on the huge stack already mined, rather than just what's going to be mined in the next year. This one frame shift is really key to understanding the current state of the market.

Silver is primarily mined as a byproduct of Copper Lead, Zinc, and Gold mines. This may seem like a random interesting fact, but it actually effects the market a whole lot. If we were talking about lithium instead of silver, and the lithium price went up 5x, every lithium mine in the world will go into overdrive, try to expand production as fast as possible, build any new mines they could, and that will eventually reverse or slow the price increase. If you have a mine that produces 90% of their revenue from lead and zinc, they aren't likely to do the same expansion if the 10% of production that’s silver goes up 5x.

I’ve heard some people talk about the market size of silver as being $1.5T. That's the rough value of all silver ever mined in 3000 years, and is pretty irrelevant in this context. The amount of silver in investible bar form is under 3B oz, which is less than $80B. The Comex has about 110M oz, in registered inventory, and 244M oz in eligible inventory. Eligible inventory is inventory that could be put up for sale if the owners wanted, so it might not be for sale at any given price. The LBMA has 1B oz, but around 85% is already owned by ETF’s. There is lot of silver in the world, but very little for sale in an investment grade, at anywhere near current prices. For a market apparently worth $1.5T, it seems like you could buy every bar in available in the world for about $7B. That’s obviously not counting the existing demand, so it might not take a huge amount of new demand to move this market significantly.

Never forget that every oz of silver in the world is already owned by someone. When people talk about “new” supply coming on the market, that has to be someone who wasn’t willing to sell at the old price but is willing to sell at the new price.

Although there has been much more silver mined through history, silver inventories have been chipped away for decades by industrial consumption, while gold inventories have grown. Don’t forget that although gold has grown, so has the human population, and especially the population those with enough wealth to own gold or silver.

The whole mining industry has been slumping for a very long time. Discoveries of new significant deposits are not only down, but new additions to PM reserves fail to add as many oz as are produced each year. If you consider that it takes years between exploring, drilling, permitting, more drilling, and construction of a new mine, there could be a very big lag between the price going up, and any significant new supply entering the market.

Some people say that if the price goes up any significant amount, a flood of silver will come in from old coins, silverware, jewelry, etc, and correct the problem. In 2011, when silver hit $50/oz, the amount of silver recycled, went up about 50%, from around 100M oz to 150M oz, but that increase was only a small fraction of the mine supply (over 800M oz), so the broader supply demand picture didn’t really change much. There’s still a huge amount of silver in coins, silverware, jewelry, etc, but if it didn’t come back into the market at $50 in 2011, why would it come out of hiding now, for less? Also, although there are still lots of old silver teapots and spoons, they don’t make a lot of new silverware and every year that stockpile shrinks as old spoons get melted down. Much of the silver used in the “silverware” portion of the current demand pie, is used for electroplating, and that silver is never getting recycled.

Over the past several decades, some of the supply demand imbalance in the silver market has come from governments eroding their silver stockpiles. Many countries used to make coinage from silver, so they had to keep stockpiles, both functionally for making more coins, but also as a strategic and central bank asset. Today, the US, Canada, UK, and most other developed countries, have sold the majority of their silver reserves decades ago. The US government had 350M oz in 1970, and around 50M oz from 2006 to today.

&amp;#x200B;

Silver is found in the earths crust at about a 14/1 ratio to gold. Current mine production is about 8/1, and existing stockpiles of investment grade product are not known well enough to compare, but I’ve heard estimates ranging from 3/1 to 1/1. The current price is 68/1. Gold hit it's all time high in 2020, but silver was half it's nominal all time high, or less than a quarter of it's inflation adjusted high.

If you take a more broad view of value over time, gold and silver have historically been valued along the lines of their production and naturally occurring scarcity, from 10/1 to 15/1. This ratio held for thousands of years. If you look at an inflation adjusted chart of silver prices going back many hundreds of years, silver prices were usually many hundreds of dollars. From 1720-1900, the silver price never dipped below $100, and was as high as $500, in todays dollars. For most of the last 3000 years, an average skilled labourers days wage was 0.1 oz of silver.

Lots of people are talking about a shortage of silver, and it’s so much bigger of a deal than most realize. Mints are admitting they can’t source material, and shortages that were once limited to small bars and coins, have spilled over into 1000 oz bars. These days, there are shortages developing in so many things, so it’s seems normal, but this shortage is nothing like the others. As I said at the beginning, if most other shortages are self correcting by the functioning of the markets (planting more corn, etc), but this market is valued based on a stockpile built over 3000 years, then a shortage means we’ve run out of the stockpiles, and the one and only thing that can correct the supply, is higher prices. Given what we saw in 2011, with very little new silver coming back into the market at $50 (or an average though the year in the mid 30’s), it’s safe to conclude that the price it would take to truly balance the market, with no more stack to erode, would have to be dramatically higher than that.

**Demand**

The most important thing to understand about the demand side of the silver equation, is how it’s changed over time. For thousands of years, silver was money. Before the last 150 years, pretty much all the silver ever discovered was still around, and the demand was that it became money the moment it was found. That’s a pretty simple demand case. If you were a prospector in the 1700’s, you could walk into a bar and spend silver or gold you found that day. If you spun some wool, you’d have to trade that for silver or gold before you could spend it.

Then, over time, more and more uses for silver started to appear. This is when silver gained its hybrid, monetary and industrial status, and this status is really key to understanding silver in the world today.

Today, around 60% of silver demand comes from industry, and that demand is quite inelastic. If a company makes smartphones, and the average phone uses $0.35 worth of silver, you don’t stop making phones when the price of silver quadruples, and your phone needs $1.40 worth of silver. Silver is used very broadly, since it’s found in alloys used in most electronics. Because of that broad industrial usage, and the difficulty recovering such small quantities, about 2/3 of the silver consumed is never recovered. If you have a gold watch, someday that watch will break, and the gold will probably end up in a gold bar. If you make a cell phone, one day it will break, and most will end up in a landfill. Even some of the silver that goes through a recycling process still ends up being melted into an alloy so it still isn’t recovered as silver.

Also, industry demand is almost always hard to substitute. Silver is the most conductive element, most reflective element, and has natural anti microbial properties. These properties are elemental and irreplaceable. I’m sure if people could easily use copper instead, they probably already would have. There is a natural trend where a single product, like a solar panel, will use less silver per unit, as manufacturing becomes more and more efficient, but that effect is counteracted by more and more products using silver and higher quantities of production driving that efficiency.

Silver’s industrial demand is highest in fast growing sectors like electric vehicles, solar panels, and electronics. EV’s use significantly more silver that gas cars, and also use lots in their charging infrastructure. The average solar panel uses 0.6 oz of silver, and 5G networks are expected to increase silver demand significantly as they roll out. The trend is clear, the future needs silver, and things that haven’t been invented yet, will probably need the irreplaceable properties only silver can offer.

The other side of silver demand is its monetary or investment demand. At the core of this demand is silver’s historical role as a store of value, as well as the investment case I’ve been spelling out in this and my last post. Silver’s monetary history revolves around it having the key properties of money: durability, portability, divisibility, fungibility, uniformity, limited supply, and acceptability. It’s worth noting that every element on the periodic table that meets these characteristics is already considered money. If you eliminate all gasses, all the elements that are reactive and non durable, all the elements that are too abundant to be portable (lead, iron, etc), the elements that aren’t easily divisible and fungible, so they can’t be divided and reformed, at the end of all that, you are left with only the precious metals. Maybe you can make the case for copper and nickel, but guess what those have been used for.

So, we’ve established that silver is a store of value based on inherent qualities. That makes it a safe haven investment, since people look to stores of value when the future becomes uncertain. For decades now, the world has been lulled into a false sense of security by the US dollar global standard, coinciding with a period of particularly low inflation. A key driver of that period of low inflation, is deflation in prices of consumer goods, because of globalization. Basically, we keep printing more and more money, but China keeps cheaply producing more and more products. This has kept inflation contained in localized asset bubbles (stocks, real estate, art), and most people haven’t seen it effect their lives much (until recently). That could change quickly. The low prices we’ve grown accustomed to, probably won’t keep dropping as we keep printing more money. In short, once China already produces everything, there’s no prices left to bring down to offset the printer.

For years, pretty much every country in the world has been printing money like crazy, and the only thing that makes it not look crazy, is the fact that everyone else is doing it, and currencies are only valued relative to other currencies. People call this the race to debase. Inflation has gone from a non issue in the minds of the world, to the issue of the day, and that’s unlikely to change any time soon.

Much of the developed world has forgotten about gold and silver, with academics referring to it as a barbarous relic, and with the biggest pools of money, hedge funds, pension funds, endowment funds, collectively owning less than 1% of their portfolios in gold, and presumably a fraction of that amount in silver. For individuals, the percentages are probably a bit higher than for funds, but as a share of all wealth in the west, precious metals are a rounding error, even today and even with all the attention we give to the space. It’s just not on most people’s radar yet.

Basically, we have a good case that demand should be higher, but it’s actually pretty low in the grand scheme of things, with most individuals owning none and even the biggest funds not bothering to hold any. Despite this, let’s consider how the market is holding up to this (actually very low) demand.

I can remember a couple times when interest among retail investors spiked up, and premiums on coins and small bars went up dramatically. Every time this happened before 2020, the market would stabilize in months and premiums would fall back down. Producers of small bars and coins got a bigger incentive to make more, so they did, and the market calmed. In 2011, my local dealer would sell me high premium coins, but he could also get me 1000 oz bars at $0.60 over spot.

When covid hit, premiums rose again, but this time they stayed high. The reason is that this time the shortage is across the entire market. My local dealer passes on the prices he pays with a small markup, and his prices have stayed high on coins and bars, but also now his premiums on 1000 oz bars are up to $2.50. Shortages have reached every corner of the market, and there could soon be a time when it simply becomes unavailable.

Scarcity is an incredible driver of behaviour. There are a lot of companies who really rely on silver, and who currently use just in time inventory, so they can’t keep their operations going for long without new inventory. If I recall the toilet paper aisle in March 2020, when people start to sense a shortage, they tend to stock up. Unlike toilet paper, this won’t just be driven by fear and need. This would be driven by fear, need, want and greed. Imagine if toilet paper were a target of huge speculators that could easily and cheaply, house many years of global production, and suppliers couldn’t easily ramp up production, to respond to the shortage. It probably would have left a whole lot more desperate people, willing to pay a whole lot more.

Silver is a market that probably deserves more demand than it’s getting, but in reality has so little demand that the biggest funds and investors barely notice that it exists. Even this tiny demand has been enough to clean out existing stockpiles and create a shortage. The sleeping dragon in this situation is that industrial users need to buy, regardless of price or market conditions. Prices will rise, shortages will grow, and then industrial users will have to compete with a larger and larger group of investors for scarce supply.

**Summary**

This is a small market, with growing and inelastic demand, and an existing supply demand imbalance, that has been eroding available inventories for years. It’s currently in short supply (in an investable, deliverable form), and that shortage is getting worse by the day. The silver market is historically prone to wild spikes, and this time, a large spike up in price would actually be reverting to a more normal historical price (over the very long term), in terms of the ratio with gold, and in absolute inflation adjusted price. The physical price diverging from the paper price may force the Comex and LBMA to make more deliveries than they are basically built for, dry up any available inventory, and may cause a large number of paper contracts to owe physical metal they have no way of obtaining at anywhere near current prices.

Industrial users are the sleeping dragon in this situation, needing hundreds of millions of oz per year to operate their businesses, and historically relying on just in time inventory. Now they are being forced to wait to get inventory, and may start to see a shortage ahead. Some may decide that the risk of not getting product or having to pay much higher prices is too great, so they need to take some of the dwindling inventory for themselves. The more scarce it becomes, the more industry will want to stock up. Speculators will get wind of this, and further compete for the last scraps of bullion.

This situation looks to me like a big bonfire, soaking in the gasoline of paper leverage, that may ignite anytime. I’ll be sitting by with my marshmallows, waiting to sell into a market that might look much different than when I bought."

What is the unique feature that makes it so different or what is the huge growth potential that is going to hold this valuation. I am thinking of building a short position. I am not saying that it will not be a major player but in way is it worth such a multiple of Carmax, Autonation, Lithia etc..

Firstly, the revenue is not there yet. We just coming off a very hot used car market and shortage in the new car side. Book values are crazy and CARVANA is putting and has been putting to much money in cars. Where are they going to get the inventory to reach the revenue of others?

They have no service or parts like the new car franchises which is a big revenue and profit center. F&amp;I products sales penetration is less with online as well. They have their own financing which i suppose is their big feature like carmax or even better Drivetime. 

The online buying and delivery option can be done by any other franchise. There is nothing unique to it. If you look how lithia motors for example expands their used car inventory in 500mile areas to compete. 

They spend a lot of advertising dollars on Cargurus, [car.com](https://car.com) etc.. With online only what are their conversions like compared to the others that have active sales departments.

 **AMMO, Inc. Reports Financial Results for its Fiscal Fourth Quarter and Full Fiscal Year**

**– Annual Adjusted EBITDA of $8.1 million and Adjusted EPS of $0.07 per share –**

**SCOTTSDALE, Ariz., June 29, 2021** — AMMO, Inc. (Nasdaq: POWW, POWWP) (“AMMO” or the “Company”), a premier American ammunition and munition components manufacturer and technology leader, is pleased to announce it has reported financial results for its fiscal fourth quarter and year ending March 31, 2021.

**Financial Summary for Fiscal Fourth Quarter 2021 vs. Fiscal Fourth Quarter 2020**

* Sales for the quarter were $24.2 million – an increase of 409\*\*%\*\*
* Gross Profit Margins increased to approximately 23% – an increase of 179%
* Operating expenses as a percentage of sales decreased 58\*\*%\*\*
* Adjusted EBITDA increased to $4.8 million — an increase of 296%
* Adjusted EPS increased to $0.04 – an increase of 167%

**Financial Summary for Fiscal 2021 vs. Fiscal 2020**

* Sales for the year increased to $62.5 million – an increase of 300%
* Gross Profit Margins increased to approximately 18% — an increase of 173%
* Operating expenses as a percentage of sales decreased 61\*\*%\*\*
* Annual adjusted EBITDA increased to $8.1 million – an increase of 213%
* Adjusted EPS Increased to $0.07 — an increase of 150%

AMMO is positioned for exceptional growth in Fiscal 2022 after establishing a new standard for the Company. Demand fundamentals in the US domestic ammunition market are exceedingly strong and we are seeing no indication of slowing. The Company broke ground on its new state-of-the-art plant, scheduled to be fully operational in approximately one year. And we have established the Company as a cutting-edge design firm, announcing a contract for the design and manufacture of technologically advanced ballistic match ammunition for the US Department of Defense. Our fiscal fourth quarter delivered the best quarterly performance in Company history, with even better quarters reasonably expected to follow throughout Fiscal 2022.

Additionally, the Company experienced sales growth of 46\*\*%\*\* quarter-over-quarter, a $7.6 million increase.

The Company’s margins have also increased to approximately 23% for our fourth fiscal quarter, an increase of 179% or $7.1 million year-over-year. When depreciation and amortization are added back to the cost of goods sold, our gross profit margin increases to 27% for the quarter.

Our operating expenses as a percentage of sales was 25\*\*%**, representing a 58**%\*\* decrease from the prior year quarter. For the year, our operating expense as a percentage of sales was 27%, a 61% decrease from the prior year.

Net Loss for the quarter was approximately $463,000, which includes approximately $3.4 million of non-cash expenses. Net Loss for the year was approximately $7.8 million, which also included $10.1 million in non-cash expenses.

Adjusted EBITDA has grown to $4.8 million for the quarter – 296% increase from the prior year. For the year, our Adjusted EBITDA was $8.1 million – 213% increase from the prior year.

The continuing improvement in adjusted EBITDA and margin shows the impact of the scaling we are beginning to see in our operational costs. We expect our first half fiscal 2022 EBITDA to be better than the second half of fiscal 2021 as a standalone.

AMMO’s adjusted earnings per share (EPS) increased to $0.04 for our fiscal fourth quarter, representing a 167% year-over-year increase. Our adjusted EPS increased to $0.07 for the year, representing a 150% increase from the prior year. Adjusted EPS is a metric the Company values as we believe it is a better representation of the Company’s true operating performance.

The revenue guidance for the 1st quarter of our 2022 Fiscal Year is $41M and will include two months of operations from our newly acquired Gunbroker.com assets. As previously announced, we expect to achieve profitability in this quarter."

Riding off what the gentleman shared above, I would like to share my opinion on the *when* to buy in. 


The stock, as seen in the daily chart [over here](https://imgur.com/RbgmdOk)  has been ranging for a while. Mostly I would say because of profit taking and seemingly reaccumulation of positions.





This means, whoever has been reaccumulating here has a strong position to send the stock to another rally. This is also seen by how it seems ready to move as it retests last point of support (see **lps** on the chart) would be the last test it needed before taking off.

You manage the micro risks within your control and hope the macro risks outside your control does not bite. If a true zombie apocalypse or an outer space asteroid that wiped away dinosaurs was about to hit, what good really will a doomsday prepper's risk management do? Reality never really plays out the way it looks in the movies. I'm definitely betting no one would care what your 20 year alpha or sharpe ratio is. If there is risk (seen or unseen) in everything we do, then risk must be our very existence. Your thoughts?"

GoldSpot Discoveries Corp., is a technology services company in mineral exploration. GoldSpot is a leading team of expert scientists who merge geoscience and data science to deliver bespoke solutions that transform the mineral discovery process.

GoldSpot produces Smart Targets and advanced geological modelling that saves time, reduces costs and provides accurate results. 

Their AI tech has been applied in order to gain more accurate and efficient drill holes than previously possible. Some of their past examples are showing great proof that their technology concept works, and more specifically, their methodology as well.

Some of the best drill results using their AI guidance has been 19m of 92.86 g/t Au, which is about 1764 grammeteres. That result is definitely in the higher-end of results.

Some of their financials have gone well with tier net income growth hitting all time records with 92% increase in consulting revenue. As well as net income of about $5.7M compared to about $60K in the year prior.

GoldSpot also recently announced that they have been engaged by Ethos Gold to apply its desired AI discovery tech at their Toogood Project on New World Island in Newfoundland. The work will be ordered to help triangulate drill ready targets of gold deposits across the 118km2 property.

Tl;DR:

Tesla entered the S&amp;P 500 to great fanfare on Dec. 21, 2020, in a rebalance of the index. It surged well over 20% in its first month, but since then has fallen, standing now with gains of about 5%, lagging the S&amp;P 500’s (^GSPC) near-16% gain in that same timeframe.

Tesla’s entry meant one company had to leave, as the S&amp;P 500 does not become the S&amp;P 501 when a new company joins the club. To make room, S&amp;P had to kick out Apartment Investment and Management (AIV) from the index, but since that December 2020 rebalance, the company’s stock spiked almost 60% — and though it went down still stands around 40% higher than it did when it got the boot."

I also understand they may not always hit their 2x or 3x goal or whatever it is and have higher expense ratios. 

However, if the benchmark is pretty stable, SP500 or Nasdaq for example, why wouldn’t one want to buy and hold a leveraged ETF longer term? Even if it doesn’t hit a 3x goal, wouldn’t it still be more profitable than its tracked fund? 

Take QQQ and TQQQ (3x leveraged) for an example. QQQ is up 241% over the past 5 years. TQQQ is up 1,592% in the same time.

stocks,"Be greedy when others are fearful part II - Intel This is something I've been thinking about lately.  I guess to keep it short, a company like Intel still has a lot of gas left in the tank and a lot of discussion around the company seems to be a zero-sum game.

I don't really think this is the case and I feel that many investors are essentially missing out on an easy pitch with Intel's future developments.


Special DD to satisfy ""high effort"" posting in a discussion flair:

""Thanks for joining today. Intel delivered a strong Q1 that beat our January guide on both the top and bottom line, driven by exceptional demand for our products and exquisite execution by our team. We shipped a record volume of notebook CPUs. We launched new competitive Intel Core and Xeon processors.

Mobileye had its best quarter ever. With tremendous industry support, we unveiled our IDM 2.0 strategy, setting a bold new course for technology leadership at Intel. The response from employees, partners, and customers has been incredible. Our teams are reinvigorated, innovating, and executing.

The PC ecosystem, in particular, is experiencing a resurgence. This remote work and learning dynamics of COVID led to more PC shipments in 2020 than at any point since 2012, and that's continuing. 2021 is shaping up to be the largest PC market ever. In fact, we shipped more notebook CPUs in Q1 than in any other quarter in our history

Total platform unit volumes were up well over 30% in the first quarter. In many markets, one PC in every home is no longer enough. The number of PCs per household, what we call PC density, is increasing. We are seeing strong growth in education where, on a global basis, the number of PCs per 100 students and teachers still remains in the single digits.

Every student needs a laptop, and we have a long way to go. In addition, there are over 400 million PCs running Windows 10 that are over four years old today, which is an enormous PC refresh opportunity. Intel is leading this rejuvenation of the PC with marketing, user experience, and purpose-built innovation at the software, silicon, and platform level. We shipped Tiger Lake-H for notebooks and Rocket Lake for desktops, and customer reception has been enthusiastic.

As a sign of our improving execution, we qualified Tiger Lake-H ahead of schedule in 10 nanometers, and we expect 10-nanometer unit volumes to cross over 14 nanometers in the second half of the year. Our Intel Evo platform gives buyers the very best mobile experience, and we're deepening our ecosystem engagement with partners, including Microsoft, Google, and Samsung to advance the PC experience in new, innovative ways. We see no signs of PC demand slowing and believe the industry will return to shipping more than 1 million units a day. With over 100 million Xeon servers in the installed base, the world runs on Intel.

Building on that foundation, we recently launched our most advanced high-performance data center platform optimized to power the industry's broadest range of workloads from the cloud to the network to the intelligent edge. At the heart of this is our new third-gen Intel Xeon Scalable processor codenamed Ice Lake, which offers nearly 50% gen-over-gen performance improvements across a range of workloads. We are already shipping Ice Lake to more than 30 customers, including major cloud providers, communication service providers, enterprise and HPC customers. Another trend driving demand for more and more optimized computing performance is the infusion of artificial intelligence and machine learning into nearly every application.

As the only x86 datacenter CPU with built-in AI acceleration, Ice Lake provides 74% gen-over-gen improvement on AI workloads. And our Habana discrete solutions address the needs of those customers with extreme AI demands in areas like training. Sometimes customers want both. For example, you see San Diego will use Intel Xeon and Habana AI accelerators to power their new Voyager supercomputer.

Mobileye set a new quarterly record. Mobileye's assisted driving technology continues to win over automakers with eight new design wins in Q1. We have programs with 13 of the 15 top automotive OEMs. Mobileye continues to open new categories such as delivery transport with the win at Udelv and is rapidly evolving to power L4 fully autonomous robotaxis beginning next year.

We continue to have extraordinary success winning the next-generation 5G environments. A great example from this quarter is our collaboration with Google Cloud to develop solutions that help communication service providers accelerate 5G deployment across multiple network and edge locations. We're already seeing significant adoption of OneAPI and OneAPI-powered toolkits for high-performance computing, AI, and data analytics. Developers and customers are embracing One API's open standards-based approach for unified programming across architectures and vendors.

 This includes leading cloud service providers who are embracing OneAPI at scale. The unprecedented demand for semiconductors has stressed supply chains across the industry. We've doubled our internal wafer capacity in the last few years, but the industry is now challenged by a shortage of foundry capacity, substrates, and components. We expect it will take a couple of years for the ecosystem to make the significant investments to address these shortages.

This fundamental industry challenge underscores the importance of our unique and differentiated IDM 2.0 strategy. IDM 2.0 utilizes our internal factory network to reliably deliver leadership products and provide the industry another source of foundry capacity through our new Intel Foundry Services. Leveraging our IDM advantage, we are working aggressively across our global supply chain to solve substrate shortages to satisfy our customers' surging demand and gain market share. For example, by partnering closely with our suppliers, we are creatively utilizing our internal assembly factory network to remove a major constraint in our substrate supply.

Coming online in Q2, this capability will increase the availability of millions of units in 2021. It's a great example where the IDM model gives us flexibility to address the dynamic market. It's clear the industry and Intel will need more capacity to meet strong future demand, which is why we are dramatically expanding our foundry capability with Intel Foundry Services starting with a $20 billion investment for our first large-scale foundry operations in Arizona. We plan to expand other locations and establish Intel Foundry Services as a major provider of committed foundry capacity in the U.S. and Europe while ensuring a sustainable and secure semiconductor supply for the world. Since its announcement, the industry response to Intel Foundry Services has already been incredible. We are engaged with well over 50 potential customers today. We're seeing excitement from some of the top technology giants in the world across industry verticals ranging from automotive to high-performance compute and cloud service providers

We've been responding to and proactively engaging with automotive component suppliers on how we can help them with their supply chains and alleviate shortages in both the near and long term. We're doing our part to address this global supply crisis, but we cannot do it alone. The investment needed at the scale required is immense, and it will require close industry and government partnership to address this need. Governments around the world are recognizing the critical nature of semiconductors and the need to increase advanced chip manufacturing capacity and prepare for the future.

We are encouraged by President Biden's recognition of semiconductor manufacture as a critical component of our national infrastructure and its inclusion along with key research and infrastructure investments in broadband in the American Jobs plan. Looking ahead, we're confident our strategy will drive innovation and technology leadership for Intel. 7 nanometers is progressing well, and IDM 2.0 puts us on a path to restore process performance leadership and build on our industry-leading packaging technologies. With IDM 2.0, we will have superior capacity and supply resilience by leveraging our internal and external capacity and a superior cost structure.

By accelerating our clock rate of innovation, we will deliver leadership products in every category. In the PC business, we will follow the successful launches of Tiger Lake and Rocket Lake with Alder Lake, which is currently sampling and will ship in the second half of this year. Within the next couple of weeks, we'll tape in the compute tile for Meteor Lake, our first 7-nanometer CPU for 2023. In the data center, we will follow the strong ramp of Ice Lake with Sapphire Rapids, which is scheduled to reach production around the end of this year, and ramp in the first half of 2022.

Overall, our 2023 road maps are firm and under execution, and our 2024 and 2025 plans are well under way to provide unquestioned leadership products in every category we participate in. The Intel innovation machine is fired up. Before I pass it to George for the details in the quarter, let me reiterate how excited I am to be back. You can feel the energy inside of Intel, the passion to innovate, and the drive that made us great."""

**With more than half of Americans admitting to shopping for their BBQ supplies last-minute, limited edition grilling kits provide a convenient solution beginning July 1**

SAN FRANCISCO, June 28, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- DoorDash (NYSE: DASH), the nation's leading last-mile logistics platform, announced today a partnership with Beyond Meat**®**, a leader in plant-based meat, to offer limited-edition, July 4th grilling kits to help customers host the ultimate BBQ featuring this summer's hottest grilling essential: the sizzling new Beyond Burger®. The kits are available exclusively on DoorDash for on-demand delivery from [DashMart](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3209823-1&amp;h=575202139&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.doordash.com%2Fintroducing-dashmart-1891ecc0257d&amp;a=DashMart), a new type of convenience store owned, operated, and curated by DoorDash.

&amp;#x200B;

 

As many people prepare for a summer of grilling and gathering, the kit also provides a seamless way for consumers to get their grilling essentials without taking a last-minute trip to the grocery store. According to a national consumer survey that polled 1,000 U.S. adults\*:  


* **Grilling is king:** Nearly three quarters (73%) of Americans agree that grilling is a must-do activity this summer -- more than visiting family (69.4%), traveling long distances (42.7%) and going on dates (36.1%).
* **Plant-based meat -- good for you and for BBQ**: Consumers are increasingly reaching for plant-based options. Over three quarters (78%) of Americans want plant-based meat at cookouts and BBQs, and more than half (65%) are choosing plant-based options to eat healthier -- particularly millennials.
* **Delivery to the cookout rescue:** Nearly everyone (91%) can relate to needing supplies in a pinch. More than half (60%) of Americans admit to shopping for their BBQ supplies last-minute, with nearly three-quarters (72%) forgetting an item when they do so.

 

In addition to the Beyond Burger®, the grilling kits offer a custom grilling mit, apron, grilling tools, a bottle opener and a recipe card with custom dishes. The new burger is crafted to look, cook and taste like beef while offering strong nutritional benefits—such as: 35% less fat, 35% less saturated fat, fewer calories and no cholesterol compared to an 80/20 ground beef burger patty—to bring the thrill of grilling plant-based meat to a backyard near you. Additional items*—*from snacks, beverages, ice cream and more*—*can be purchased on-demand from DashMart to complete the gathering.

""This 4th of July weekend, we're excited to partner with DoorDash to further our mission to make plant-based options more accessible to all,"" said Rebecca Infusino, VP of Retail Sales, Beyond Meat. ""There's nothing more classic and delicious than a perfectly grilled, juicy burger on a hot summer day. We've made this classic pastime even better this summer with the great taste and nutritional benefits of our newest Beyond Burger, and the unbeatable convenience of having it delivered to your BBQ in under an hour.""

stocks,"50 years of tax cuts for the rich failed to trickle down &gt; Tax cuts for the wealthy have long drawn support from conservative lawmakers and economists who argue that such measures will ""trickle down"" and eventually boost jobs and incomes for everyone else. But a new study from the London School of Economics says 50 years of such tax cuts have only helped one group — the rich.  
&gt;  
&gt;The new paper, by David Hope of the London School of Economics and Julian Limberg of King's College London, examines 18 developed countries — from Australia to the United States — over a 50-year period from 1965 to 2015. The study compared countries that passed tax cuts in a specific year, such as the U.S. in 1982 when President Ronald Reagan slashed taxes on the wealthy, with those that didn't, and then examined their economic outcomes.   
&gt;  
&gt;Per capita gross domestic product and unemployment rates were nearly identical after five years in countries that slashed taxes on the rich and in those that didn't, the study found.   
&gt;  
&gt;But the analysis discovered one major change: The incomes of the rich grew much faster in countries where tax rates were lowered. Instead of trickling down to the middle class, tax cuts for the rich may not accomplish much more than help the rich keep more of their riches and exacerbate income inequality, the research indicates.

A conspiracy, also known as a plot, is a secret plan or agreement between persons (called conspirers or conspirators) for an unlawful or harmful purpose, such as murder or treason, especially with political motivation,[1] while keeping their agreement secret from the public or from other people affected by it. In a political sense, conspiracy refers to a group of people united in the goal of usurping, altering or overthrowing an established political power. Depending on the circumstances, a conspiracy may also be a crime, or a civil wrong.[2] The term generally implies wrongdoing or illegality on the part of the conspirators, as people would not need to conspire to engage in activities that were lawful and ethical, or to which no one would object.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

stocks,"Romeo Power - Major EV Recovery + Squeeze Candidate Romeo Power is at $8.48 as of this post, but I believe it will soon be much higher. I will keep it to the point. Romeo Power's stock was heavily beaten down after revising down 2021 revenues because of cell supply shortages that affected the entire EV market. It appears these cell shortages are being addressed and could allow them to get back on track with forward revenues- some EV related stocks have already recovered, but RMO has been left out of the recent run. On May 13th, the company announced they had made major updates to cell supplier agreements and were ""Shortly signing a deal for multiple gigawatt hours with a top tier supplier"" - Lionel Selwood, CEO. It has been over 6 weeks now since this statement, which drives me to speculate that ""shortly"" is almost here, especially with the management addition announcement on June 16th for their new CFO, Kerry Shiba - who has managed Billions of dollars for several decades, and has helped many companies outperform. 

&amp;#x200B;

Speaking of ""short,"" the current float is 24% shares short, as the company is barely 25-30% off of its all time lows of $6.60, and over 80% off of its all time high of $38. Mind you, this company has deals to produce with PACCAR and BorgWarner. BorgWarner is also a major shareholder in the company. This is a legit and well resourced company that seems to have taken a series of overreaction hits the last several months. 

&amp;#x200B;

Vanguard recently added over 7.5m Shares in their index funds on 6/1, and now own around 15M shares out of the 94M available in public float. BlackRock is also in on this with atleast 2M shares. The company was also included in the Russell 3000 on June 25th. Most analysts have an average fair value of $12-15, implying 45-80% upside from current price. We've seen this ticker jump over 50% in one day on April 6th and I don't think that was the last time we'll see that, and I think if we do get cell supplier news with a ""top tier supplier"" Panasonic, LG, BYD, or any of the giants which are mostly Asia based-  this time the gains might truly stick, as a solution to the cell supply shortages are the looming piece of news, that I'm sure Romeo's management knows, will shift the investor sentiment entirely. 

&amp;#x200B;

Again do your own DD but most of what I've stated here are just observations available to the public yet not heavily discussed. TLDR; Romeo has Moon potential and the stars are aligned for it to happen sooner than later."

**BULL ARGUMENT**

Iridium has the largest constellation and orbits closer to Earth than any other networks. This allows for shorter network registration times and low communications latency. Globalstar only has [48 satellites](https://sbs-satbill.com/globalstar-billing-platform/) and *does not* cover the poles. Specifically, Globalstar only has coverage [between the latitudes 70 north and -70 south](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1023/A:1019164909332).

In addition to having more satellites and more coverage of the Earth, [Iridium was certified](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/worlds-first-truly-global-real-time-maritime-emergency-service-launched-by-iridium-301193130.html) to use in the Global Maritime Distress and Safety System in December 2020. This ended a monopoly that had previously been held by Inmarsat since the system started in 1999.

Iridium is already a top key-player for global maritime satellite communications. The respective market was valued at $2.39B in 2021 and is [expected to reach $3.96B in the next 5 years](https://www.marketwatch.com/press-release/global-maritime-satellite-communication-market-2021-is-expected-to-register-a-cagr-of-69-with-top-countries-data-industry-size-share-business-growth-revenue-trends-market-demand-penetration-and-forecast-2021-06-15). That is a CAGR of 6.9%.

Iridium just secured a [$30M R&amp;D contract](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/iridium-awarded-30-million-research--development-contract-by-the-united-states-army-301318757.html) with the United States Army to develop a payload to provide more effective sensor-to-soldier data transmission when in the field. Matt Desch, CEO of Iridium, commented on the contract, ""This is one of the largest engineering contracts in Iridium's history... It also represents another phase in the evolution of our growing relationship with the Department of Defense."" Moreover, the U.S. Department of Defense has partnered with Iridium for more than 20 years and is the largest customer. In September 2019, Iridium secured a [7-year, $738.5M](https://spacenews.com/iridium-lands-seven-year-738-5-million-defense-department-contract/) contract with the Department of Defense for unlimited use of the Iridium satellite constellation.

Iridium completed a [$3B multi-year constellation upgrade](https://investor.iridium.com/2019-02-06-Iridium-Declares-Victory-3-Billion-Satellite-Constellation-Upgrade-Complete) in 2019, replacing all satellites and upgrading the supporting ground infrastructure. To complete the upgrade, eight Falcon 9 rockets were used to launch 75 satellites into low Earth orbit ([66 operational, 9 in-orbit spares](https://www.roadpost.com/iridium-satellite-network)). Final payments to SpaceX for those launches were made during the second quarter of 2019.

**BEAR ARGUMENT**

Iridium relies on single-source suppliers for the manufacture of most of the subscriber equipment, and purchases parts that are periodically subject to shortages. There is a large reliance on a few significant customers, particularly U.S. government agencies meaning a loss of that business will significantly impact revenue. Moreover, Iridium relies on a single primary commercial gateway and primary satellite network operations center.

Last, but not least, Iridium is in debt. Specifically, [$1.39B as of March 2021](https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/telecom/nasdaq-irdm/iridium-communications/news/does-iridium-communications-nasdaqirdm-have-a-healthy-balanc). Iridium also has liabilities of $88.3M falling due within a year and liabilities of $1.81B due beyond that which outweigh the cash and short-term receivables by $1.62B.

**CONCLUSION**

I'm bullish on Iridium and I only see good things for the long term. Although in debt, I think Iridium can handle the current debt levels. They continue to be the front runner for government contracts and are the only provider that covers the entire globe. From December 2019 to December 2020, Iridium saw an increase of 176K subscribers (14%) and I believe this will continue to grow. Voice and data, and IoT revenues have historically generated higher margins than subscriber equipment revenue, and this trend will likely continue. The diverse customer base including end-users in land-mobile, IoT, maritime, aviation, and government will continue to grow overtime.

stocks,"NVDA 9% of portfolio? I upped NVDA in my IRA before it started running recently and also have about 5% in my taxable so now it's 9% of my portfolio and I'm thinking of taking the small profit and what I put in in my IRA (4%) and redirecting it to something low risk like JNJ maybe.

stocks,"Gold Miners With Potential BASICS

This is a gamble, but I think it has limited downside and significant upside potential. I have taken some small positions to leverage a potential rise in gold prices over the next 6 months.

$GOLD and $KGC are both fundamentally sound, well established companies. In terms of P/E valuation they are both trading at moderate discounts - $GOLD about 25% &amp; $KGC about 40%, compared to industry average. Both of these companies trend with, but do not directly track, the price of gold. The gap in P/E valuation should close, especially if gold prices get back close to $2000/oz.

In addition to the Fed tanking gold prices after their meeting, at about the same time $KGC reported a fire at their Tasiast project mine in Mauritania. They have since provided a mostly positive assessment of the damage, and mining operations have resumed. They did however revise the 2021 projected output for the mine down to 2.1m oz. from 2.4m oz.

Gold took a decent hit after the Fed meeting. Prices dropped from about $1900/oz to about $1750/oz in a week. As a result, share prices for $GOLD &amp; $KGC have taken a hit. Before the Fed meeting $GOLD was trading at the $23-$24+ level. $GOLD closed @ $20.89 on 25 June. $KGC was trading around $8.00 before the Fed meeting and the fire, closed @ $6.38 on 25 June. Here are some price points for comparison.

&amp;#x200B;

* Gold price peak 6 Aug 2020 - $2071.05
* $GOLD 18 Aug 2020 - $31.22
* $KGC 19 Sep 2020 - $10.31

&amp;#x200B;

* Gold price before Fed 14 Jun 2021 - $1859.45
* $GOLD before Fed 14 Jun 2021 - $23.15

&amp;#x200B;

* Gold close 25 Jun 2021 - $1781.70
* $GOLD close 25 Jun 2021 - $20.89
* $KGC close 25 Jun 2021 - $6.38

FUTURE PRICE FACTORS

Predicting the price of gold is tricky, and frankly there are many factors which are beyond my level of understanding. My thinking is this: Inflation is real, significant and not transitory. As the US and other economies continue reopening, and inflation begins to squeeze the budgets of more and more working people, regardless of what the statistics say, it is going to become more commonly reported in the news. The result will be that retail goldbugs will put persistent upward pressure on the price of gold, even if central banks try to mitigate the rise. I also expect commodities in general to recover and rise through the rest of 2021. Gold is a unique commodity, but commodity price increases should apply upward pressure on gold as well. I don’t predict the price to spike to new ATH’s (although it could), but I do expect the price to be back to $1900 level or higher by EOY.

On the downside, I really don’t see gold prices falling significantly from here. For that to happen I think you would need to see a roaring US economy with moderately and steadily rising interest rates, significantly tightening money supply, very moderate inflation, and a profoundly strong dollar. That seems like a black swan from where we are now.

$GOLD and $KGC have floats of 1.8B and 1.3B shares respectively, so they can't be pushed around for very long. While high volume can have an impact on price short-term, because the earnings and values of these companies are so closely tied to the price of gold, longs won't be able to hold the price artificially high, and shorts won't be able to hold the price artificially low for an extended period.

CURRENT POSITIONS:

&amp;#x200B;

* 100 shares $GOLD
* 300 shares $KGC
* 20 x $GOLD 20220122 $25C
* 40 x $KGC 20220122 $10C

$KGC options are a bit more speculative than $GOLD, but both are cheap right now, with low to moderate IV, and decent theta. Both chains have good liquidity.

BOTTOM LINE

If you think the price of gold will be going up through the rest of the year, $GOLD and $KGC are both cheap buys now. If you think the price of gold is going up but aren’t sure it will be before the end of the year, buy shares and skip the options. Owning these companies should provide gains much better than owning actual gold or gold ETF’s. Based on previous price points, if gold rises 6.6% to $1900, I expect $GOLD up conservatively 15% to $24.00, and $KGC about 25% to $8.00. Those are conservative estimates. The Marketbeat analyst consensus PT for $GOLD is $33.25 and for $KGC it is $10.54. Overall, I'm looking for a 2-3 bagger on this play. Will reevaluate at the end of the summer, unless there is a big move before then.

Like I said, my understanding of gold market dynamics is pretty rudimentary. Happy to hear criticism and contrary opinions."

I've had the ARK funds in mind since they had the limelight this year but at the time I was looking, there was a lot of negative sentiment and then they took a tumble. Then I just forgot for a couple of months until now.

stocks,"Short Volume ≠ Short Interest! Tldr; *Short Volume is NOT the same as Short Interest. Short volume does NOT cause a short squeeze.*


I’ve seen lots of posts commenting “the stock is xx% shorted!” So posting to clarify something:

Short volume is NOT the same as short interest! Very big difference, do not confuse the two and spread misinformation. 

- Short volume is number of shares sold short and traded that DAY. 

- Short interest is the total % of the float out on loan being shorted. 

- Short volume is almost always higher than short interest. Also as volume increases so does short volume. 

- They are not tied to each other. Short volume can in theory be one shorted share traded back and forth 1 million times to show a short volume of 1 million. In reality it is almost always the same group of shorted shares, or people trading on preexisting shorted positions. Increasing short volume ≠ short interest. Correlation does NOT imply causation. 

*Short volume does NOT trigger a gamma squeeze nor a short squeeze.*

I have seen many posts saying various stocks are “ XX% shorted” when in reality they are referring to the short volume. Most of these stocks are too diluted to experience a gamma squeeze or a short squeeze.

Also people saying “short interest increased XX% overnight” Short interest reporting does not happen overnight, it’s monthly for FINRA and always 2 weeks delayed, as the report month end and release the reports 2 weeks later. You are looking at short volume."

**Mining vs producing:** Something people are bringing up to me a lot, which is a good point, is why this company is not mining until 2028 if they do and why they are putting up a factory immediately.  It's a good question and it made me concerned also.  I did some research and apparently Biden's administration wants US EV manufacturing dominance to be on the processing side and NOT the mining side.  They'd rather let other countries mine, then ship to us on barges, where we process it.  So in this case mined graphite processed into battery grade graphite.  source:   [Exclusive: Biden looks abroad for electric vehicle metals, in blow to U.S. miners | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/biden-looks-abroad-electric-vehicle-metals-blow-us-miners-2021-05-25/)

**Production timelines:** Some people brought up to me the fact that it wouldn't be 2022 until they were producing, tbh this made no sense to me.

**Competition:** People brought up to me stocks like $NMG, Syraah mining, and others that are trying to mine and produce graphite.  I did some research and these are sort of prop up companies that aren't really ready yet, REDACTED style, they are going after mining right away and mostly mining.  They don't seem to have a production focus and none are US based, so I personally don't like them as much.

**Commodity prices:** Some people pointed out to me that commodity prices, which graphite is one, fluctuate.  I have two things to say about this, first this is only relevant to miners since they sell graphite, not to end products for EV (battery grade, refined balls of processed graphite).  Two, EV demand will be there, so demand for graphite will be there, so demand will lead to supply constraints, which will lead to graphite producers benefitting.

**Alternative batteries:** Some people brought up solid state batteries, silicon anodes replacing graphite anodes, and other possible changes in the science landscape.  I would say, none of these even work yet."
stocks,"Wide-Moat ETF Rebalance * The VanEck Vectors Morningstar Wide Moat ETF (""MOAT"") invests in U.S.  companies that possess wide economic moats as per Morningstar's  methodology.
* \[MOAT\] owns 40 to 50 stocks with wide  moats and that are trading at a discount to fair value, usually in the  15% to 25% discount range. When moat ratings change or the discount to  fair value becomes comparatively noncompetitive with others, the  position is replaced. Not only do the components change based on moat  rating and discount to fair value, but the portfolio is re-balanced to  an equal weighting as well. This creates a relatively high annual  portfolio turnover of around 25%.

stocks,"$POWW potential run up It is known that America’s economy runs on 3 things: McDonald’s, freedom, and guns. There are not many things that Americans enjoy more than these 3 items; however, some say ammo is a close contender. We are currently experiencing an ammo shortage like no other. [People are currently scalping ammo and selling it for 3-4X MARK UP.](https://outsider.com/outdoors/viral/ammo-shortage-scalpers-buying-ammunition-profit-resale-making-issue-worse/) This is insane and we have not had a shortage of ammo like this before. 

If we take a look at the charts of one of the largest gun manufacturers and ammunition providers in the US, Smith &amp; Wesson (&amp;SWBI), you can see their stock price has rose over 60% in the last 10 trading days. This is due to them blowing their earnings expectations out of the water and a share buyback announcement. In the conference call with the higher ups of &amp;SWBI, the CEO himself states the shortage may continue to worsen and he does not believe it will get better anytime soon. 

Now here comes the good stuff: Ammo inc., also known as $POWW. This is a relatively new company that was listed on the NASDAQ on December 2020. They have some of the best financials you can hope for. Here is a link to their [investor presentation in April.]( https://ammoinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/AMMO-Inc.-Investor-Presentation-April-2021.pdf) Going back to the fiscal year of 2018, they are experiencing and projecting a 160.6% CAGR which is amazing. Their guidance for their net sales in 2021 was reported as $58M; however, they have now increased their guidance to $62.2M. For a company to increase their guidance by so much in such a short amount of time, you know good things are cooking. Due to this being the end of fiscal year of 2021 for this company, the addition to their guidance will be portrayed in their next earnings report, which comes out TOMORROW. I am banking on the fact that they will blowout their earnings just like Smith &amp; Wesson. Their net sales, gross margin, and adjusted EBITDA are increasing tremendously year over year. They recently acquired a US department of defense contract to manufacture multi-purpose rounds. The company is becoming more and more financially efficient while also being in an extremely high demand area. 

If the earnings are not spectacular tomorrow, then this will still be a good long term hold due to &amp;POWW’s exciting future. They are building a new production facility in Wisconsin that will increase their production capacity by over 100%. This facility will be finished and in production in early 2022. Just the fact that ammo in such high demand and experts believe it will not get better anytime soon, I feel good about this play."

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Monday, June 28, 2021 **PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, June 28, 2021**

Stocks traded mixed today, with the Dow Jones (DIA) underperforming while the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and the Nasdaq (QQQ) kept pushing higher, with each recording new intraday highs, encouraged by the Fed’s outlook that interest rates won’t be raised until 2023. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield fell, hovering near 1.48%, an encouraging sign for equities. Looking ahead, market participants are waiting for the June Jobs Report, set to be released this Friday. Consensus economists are looking for payroll gains to accelerate to 700,000 in June with an unemployment rate down slightly to 5.7%, with these metrics improving against May's payroll gains of 559,000 and jobless rate of 5.8%. 

Last week, President Joe Biden announced he had reached an infrastructure agreement with a bipartisan group of senators, which catalyzed a jump in industrial stocks that had been lagging the last few weeks. The deal, which would cost $1.2 trillion over the next five years, commits  $312 billion toward traditional infrastructure priorities such as roads, bridges, public transit, airports and waterways. The bulk of the remainder will be invested in water, broadband and power grid restoration, according to a fact sheet provided by the White House. 

Gabriela Santos, global market strategist at JP Morgan said, “The way we're thinking about it is, it has the positive side of the deal in terms of the equity market perspective: More spending on physical infrastructure, electric vehicles, 5G and broadband, without the tax increases which would have been a negative from the equity market perspective. This is certainly a positive especially for the more domestic, cyclical-heavy parts of the market, as well as parts of technology like semiconductors, which are more related to the 5G and the green theme."" 

Moreover, the Federal Reserve released the results of its “stress test” on US banks, an annual test instituted after the 2008 financial crisis meant to determine the financial health of lenders during an extreme hypothetical financial crisis (not unlike what was experienced last year).The test used a hypothetical “severely adverse” scenario where the U.S. economy saw GDP shrink by 4%, the unemployment rate rise to 10.75%, and the stock market contract by 55%. In the end, the test showed the 23 largest banks could withstand $474 billion in losses from loans and other positions and still emerge with more than double the minimum required capital.

The results of this stress test are extremely important because last year, during the height of the pandemic, the Fed imposed restrictions on banks on capital distributions like dividends and buybacks in order to ensure banks would have enough capital to weather the storm. Given the clean bill of health, these restrictions have now been fully lifted, paving the way for banks across the board to raise dividends and ramp up stock buyback programs.

Looking ahead, market participants are gearing up for Q2 earnings season, which is expected to be a repeat of Q1 record-setting season, with earnings expected to continue being super-charged by stronger than expected demand from savings-loaden consumers and the continued reopening of the US economy thanks to effective distribution of the coronavirus vaccine. So far, analysts are looking for S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 61.9% year-on-year in aggregate, according to FactSet data – an estimate UBS's Head of Equity Derivatives Research Stuart Kaiser said may still be ""need to be revised higher.""

The dismissal deals a major setback for the agency's complaint that could have resulted in Facebook divesting Instagram and WhatsApp.

In the filing, the court states that the FTC did not prove Facebook maintains a monopoly.

Facebook broke 52 week high after this news. This year is the reopening economy and digital advertising will help FB to increase more revenue. The PE ratio is still very reasonable, and FB will help small businesses to advertise more effectively."
stocks,"Welcome To The $1 Trillion Club, Facebook. Facebook joins the [$1 trillion market cap club](https://assetdash.com/) following the FTC's ruling.

A federal court on Monday dismissed the Federal Trade Commission’s antitrust complaint against Facebook, dealing a major setback for the agency’s complaint that could have resulted in Facebook divesting Instagram and WhatsApp.

“Although the Court does not agree with all of Facebook’s contentions here, it ultimately concurs that the agency’s Complaint is legally insufficient and must therefore be dismissed,” reads the filing from U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. “The FTC has failed to plead enough facts to plausibly establish a necessary element of all of its Section 2 claims -- namely, that Facebook has monopoly power in the market for Personal Social Networking (PSN) Services.”

Who's next to join the $1 trillion club?"
stocks,"OPEC meeting Thursday, oil positions What do you oil bulls think OPEC is going to decide on July 1st? I believe they will continue to be very conservative and favor higher prices for the time being.

I don't believe that US shale is in a position to ramp up production to compete right now either as most cos are still delivering cash to shareholders (finally,) and I believe that before ramping up production they would like to see the current price of oil to stick around for more than 1 month before investing in higher output.

That being said, I believe higher prices will stick around for the summer and I don't believe OPEC will ramp up production until the end of summer when they have a clear sign that demand is here to stay. This makes sense to me logically, but it does leave out a lot of factors.

With EU coming back from the pandemic, maybe OPEC will be inclined to ramp up production to avoid oil prices that will compare to 2008-14. That would also cause US shale producers to react/invest quicker than most expect.

Oil prices are taking a dive today for sure, and I have actually bought calls today. I currently own Exxon, and I used to own Devon and Suncor, but I instead, sold the shares and bought ITM calls that are for next year that I plan on executing if the thesis stays the same. Oil is a swing trade, but I would like the opportunity to go long if I like what I see in 6 months. I do have price targets and also plan on selling majority of my oil trade at these price targets and evaluating if a long position would be worth it when the time comes. 

Today I purchased OXY calls for Jan 22, a new addition to my port.

I purchased MORE, Devon and Suncor calls. I did not buy more exxon calls today and actually instead trimmed my shares that I'm up on to diversify into the more leveraged names. I did not sell even 10% of my position though, I just wanted exposure and more leverage on my other names, as my Exxon position is very heavy, and I wanted to take advantage of the price action leading up to this OPEC meeting."
stocks,"Difficult answer to find regarding brokerages. So, I’m looking for a brokerage that ticks ALL of these boxes, I’ve branched away from WeBull, and I’m trying to find something with these two features.

1.) Instant buying power as margin that allows purchase of options contracts with instant margin. 

2.) The ability to trade options spreads without a minimum account value. 

I’ve used several brokers and the only one that fit these two categories was Robinhood. That was my first brokerage and I refuse to go back to it, prefer something with in-house charts, and access to technical indicators.

stocks,"Thoughts on Grupo Supervielle (SUPV) What I’ve read ——Grupo Supervielle is one of Argentina's larger banking firms. Shares were trading for $30 as recently as 2018. However, the one-two punch of the recent Argentine economic meltdown and COVID-19 pandemic caused the stock to plummet to as low as $1.53 per share last year. The stock has rebounded to around $2.20 now and could have a lot of room to run. As it stands today, Supervielle is trading at just seven times trailing earnings, making this one of the cheapest stocks around both in terms of price and valuation. There is upside from a fundamental standpoint as well. Argentina is a large exporter of base metals such as copper. The price of these metals has soared this year thanks to the current inflationary wave. Furthermore, upcoming Argentine elections this fall could weaken the country's ruling left-wing party, offering a more constructive business climate for Argentine banks going forward."

stocks,"Is there any justification for NIO's current value? I hold 10 shares with an average price of 33$, was also part of the early run up getting in at 17$ before it skyrocketed last year. However, I'm conflicted on whether to keep this as a long-term hold or sell now due to it's enormous valuation.

I understand that a lot of the market cap is based on it's potential, but is there any good reason to believe it should be valued higher than current dominant car companies like Ford? Even if the best case scenario plays out for Nio and they are a force in the future EV market, do we have good reason to believe they will have a bigger piece of the pie than GM currently does?

The only reason I can imagine the current justification would be valid is if we have reason to believe there will be a lot less competition in the future EV market and they will be among a few dominant players as opposed to a more fractured market we currently have. Interested in bullish/bearish takes on their current valuation."

Everyone can see all the bids/offers as they stream in throughout the day. But we eliminate the millions of trades that are irrelevant to the market's mission of price discovery and capital allocation. I'm not in favor of stopping exchanges from offering intraday trading, but I think the standard, most liquid exchange should be an auction.

stocks,"ProventionBio is a steal right now I wanted to give everybody a heads-up with one stock, ProventionBio, as I expect this to go up significantly this year due to the release of a new drug in July. 
 
ProventionBio (PRVB) is a pharmaceutical company whose target approach is to prevent the onset or progression of disease. They currently have no marketed drug, but have one drug in the pipeline to prevent disease progression of Type I Diabetes. This drug, teplizumab, is expected to be approved on July 2nd. It has already been incorporated into the American Diabetes Association guidelines to be given at early onset to prevent/delay progression into full-blown Type 1 diabetes.
 
Here’s why I think PRVB will be worth significantly more after the release of teplizumab. Type I Diabetes occurred in 1.4 million adults and 187,000 children in 2020 alone. If half of these people were given teplizumab which experts believe to be very high (50-100 thousand per treatment course), this will make the company lots of money. The company currently has a market cap of 580M. If the cost of treatment is $50,000 and only 250,000 patients received the dose, that is 12.5 billion per year. Studies are also showing that many more diabetic cases in adults are caused by Type 1, and not type 2 diabetes, meaning that the market for this drug is only going up. 
 
The stock is a steal right now, as there was a setback for PRVB a couple months ago. All data from the clinical trial shows teplizumab to work well at delaying T1D onset. However, absorption studies were not consistent due to using old technology from when PRVB bought teplizumab from Eli-Lily. The FDA said that their absorption and other pharmacokinetic data needs to be more consistent before it would be approved. The company needs to just use more modern approach to developing the drug to get consistent absorption of the drug, which is very doable as monoclonal antibody based drugs are extremely common these days. Once that is fixed, it should be approved as an FDA advisory committee already recommended approval in late May. This drug did receive a fast-track designation due to its potential impact on Type 1 Diabetes. 

ProventionBio also has other drugs in the pipeline for Celiac Disease (currently no treatment) and lupus. I have great faith in this stock going way up in the next few years! 

I am not a financial advisor, but am a pharmacist, and just like the stock!"
stocks,"Advice needed on $TTWO - Take Two Interactive Hi everyone. I predict that GTA VI (made by Rockstar who are owned by Take Two) is going to absolutely dominate the multi billion pound gaming industry when it launches, maybe sometime early 2024. I think that any announcements about it are being purposefully delayed due to the fact that GTA V (8 years after launch) is still incredibly successful, having managed to generate nearly a billion dollars last year. 

If the new game embraces the ‘Battle Royale’ style of gameplay made popular by Fortnite, PUBG and COD like I think it will, then it’ll be targeting an even more lucrative market: Fortnite generated $5.5 billion in its first year. 

Then consider that hype significantly impacts certain areas of the market more than most as a new wave of poorly informed investors (like me) have entered the arena, and news of a release date will certainly generate a lot of positive movement when it comes...

Then consider that any further lockdowns are likely to increase spend on gaming...

So my question is, why should I not put 40% of my portfolio into $TTWO now that it’s sitting at $178 (with a high of $213)? What am I missing? I’m sure there’s something, but I’m new to investing and I don’t know what I don’t know yet! Thanks!"

stocks,"I have been trading stocks frequently the past year, including day trades. I am having trouble figuring out what Tax issues may arise. A couple of years ago I opened up an online brokerage account, and slowly started putting money into the account to play with the stock market a little bit with the intention of learning a little more about how the market works.  I was not playing with any large sum of money (it's all relative, but in my case after a couple of years of throwing money in I had about $1,500) as my real investments and retirement accounts are in much safer investments (mainly mutual funds).  The past few months I decided to give myself $1,000 of that account to essentially gamble in the market a little, buying and selling 1 or two stocks at a time every couple of days, using my 3 days trades most weeks, that sort of thing (no options or complex investments).

I have been trying to look into the tax side of things and (being typically a very cautious person) I just want to make sure I am not setting myself up for any tax issues at the end of the year if I keep playing with this account the way that I am.  I am sure I have run into the wash sale rule this year by buying and reselling the same stocks multiple times in the course of days or weeks.  I understand the basic concept of that rule, but not sure that I fully understand the tax implications.  I assume, at the end of the year, if I have essentially cashed-out that play account I would essentially just be paying the typical capital gains tax based on where I ended.  Is that correct? Are there other issues that I need to be aware of buying and selling frequently the way that I am?  I appreciate any feedback."
stocks,"Yield farming with covered $AMC options? 100%+ IRR I know 'option yield farming' sounds stupid, but hear me out why I am calling it this way.  
  
Are you bullish or bearish on $AMC? Does not really matter and you can earn an extra yield on your position without risking any more dollars.  
  
How? Very simple.

* If you are bullish on $AMC, write (i.e. sell) out of the money calls with the exercise price where you liked to sell your position. If $AMC shoots up above the exercise price, you just cash out at the price you wanted to sell anyways. And if the stock does not reach the exercise price before the option expiration, you pocket a juice option premium.
* If you are bearish, write (i.e. sell) out of the money put options with the exercise price where you liked to close your position. As with above, if $AMC drops below exercise price your position gets closed out at the price you wanted anyways. And if $AMC share price does not reach the exercise price you pocket the whole option premium.

As AMC volatility skyrocketed, option premiums are staggering. One can easily find trades to earn 10% in a month. And then roll over again and again for the next few months.  
  
That's 120% annual IRR.  
  
Recently, we have [managed](https://www.specialsituationinvestments.com/2021/06/amc-entertainment-amc-options-trade-100-upside/) \+100% on selling $AMC options 3x out of the money. Crazy.  
  
Again, all of this incremental yield is without any additional risk. Just additional return on your long/short $AMC position."
stocks,"Taxable account tax question When it comes to “taxable accounts” please let me know if I got this correct.

1. Contributions are not taxed because you already paid tax on them prior to putting them into the account.

2. When you sell a stock you only pay taxes on the capital gains and not on the contributions.

3. When you reinvest the capital gains(that you already paid taxes on when you sold) they are now considered contributions and not taxed again.

So if everything above is correct...would I be taxed once I finally withdraw the “entire balance” from the brokerage account? For example. Save money for 10 years, paid capital gains each year on sold stocks, finally withdraw it all and pay off my mortgage. I assume not but I don’t want to make a mistake.

I just wonder how the government keeps tract, do they only watch the capital gains?Because if I withdraw 150,000 in one year thats a lot if they tax it again. But again this shouldn’t count because if I’ve been buying and selling I would have already paid the capital gains tax. Hope this wasn’t too confusing. Thanks!"

stocks,"Is anyone invested in Square? Here's some positive news but with sky-high valuations, is it a good buy at these levels? # SQ Stock Rises From Pandemic Crash

Most recently, Square’s first-quarter results released last month saw revenues climb a staggering 266% year-over-year on sales of more than $5 billion. Of course, in 2020 Covid-19 was just hitting U.S. shores and folks everywhere were being introduced to lockdown orders. And to be sure, it’s a low base for making comparisons. But still, right? Right!

Just over a year ago when shares initially struggled off the market’s March 2020 bear market bottom, most pundits were reading SQ stock its last rites on worries the failure of the company’s important smaller merchant base would drag Square down with them. The reality turned out much differently. Cash App has been a large part of that success generating gross profits of nearly $500 million on growth of 171%. And now SQ appears to have a couple more aces up its sleeves.

As InvestorPlace’s resident growth maven Louis Navellier recently discussed, Square has committed itself to building a U.S.-based open-source, solar-powered Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD) mining facility. Along with the project reported to be a proof-of-concept effort, Square is looking to solve well-known challenges tied to Bitcoin’s egregious energy consumption and proof-of-work standard.

* They have mines in Canada and Australia. I think they still have upside to them tbh. With their recent development projects boarding detour, I believe they will just continue to grow.
* Their management has improved, and their revenue growth is improving even more.
* They have a nice dividend, and imo they are among Canada’s best gold miners. They recently introduced the [Automatic Share Purchase Plan](https://www.kl.gold/news-and-media/press-release-details/2021/Kirkland-Lake-Gold-Introduces-Automatic-Share-Purchase-Plan/default.aspx)

* They basically have the largest gold reserve base in the industry. They have gold mines in has ownership of gold mines in Nevada, Colorado, Ontario, Quebec, Mexico, the Dominican Republic, Australia, Ghana, Argentina, Peru, and Suriname.
* They recently [acquired GT Gold](https://www.newmont.com/investors/news-release/news-details/2021/Newmont-Completes-Acquisition-of-GT-Gold/default.aspx) too, which only made them even more profitable.

stocks,"Etsy to acquire Elo7 BROOKLYN, N.Y., June 28, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Etsy, Inc. (NASDAQ: ETSY), which operates two-sided online marketplaces that connect millions of passionate and creative buyers and sellers around the world, has signed a definitive agreement to acquire Elo7, a privately held marketplace for unique, handmade items, ranked as a top 10 ecommerce site in Brazil. Etsy will acquire the business for US$217 million in cash, subject to certain adjustments for Elo7's working capital, transaction expenses, cash and indebtedness, and reduced by the value of certain equity awards of Etsy to be granted to Elo7 employees in connection with the transaction. Following the closing of the transaction, Elo7 will continue to be headquartered in Sāo Paulo, Brazil and operate as a standalone marketplace run by its existing leadership team.

Considered a leader in 'custom and made-to-order' merchandise in Brazil with strong local brand awareness, the Elo7 marketplace connects approximately 1.9 million active buyers with approximately 56,000 active sellers and currently has approximately 8 million items for sale, the majority of which are made to order. Elo7's marketplace includes items from over 40 retail categories, with more than 50% of gross merchandise sales (GMS) from ""special event and life moment"" categories such as wedding, baby, home decor, and children's parties.

Josh Silverman, Etsy, Inc. CEO, commented, ""Elo7 is the 'Etsy of Brazil,' with a purpose and business model similar to our own. Following our recent agreement to purchase Depop, we're excited to bring another unique marketplace into the Etsy family. This transaction will establish a foothold for us in Latin America, an underpenetrated ecommerce region where Etsy currently does not have a meaningful customer base. We look forward to welcoming Elo7's talented leadership team and employees to the Etsy family.""

stocks,"Morning Update for Monday, 06/28/21 Good morning everyone! I hope you had a nice weekend and were able to take some time to relax. 

*This list is geared towards day trading. With the momentum watchlist especially, I am typically in and out very quickly, only occasionally longer than a couple minutes, usually faster scalps.* Always have a plan when you enter a trade (for profit taking and for taking a loss), and use proper risk management for your account.

**Main Watchlist:**

Gapping UP:

* NTLA: Massive gap up, worth keeping an eye on for further movement. Possible premarket support at 135. 
* CRSP: Possible support around 150. I'll be watching how things look closer to open, but should be seeing high volume today.  
* SPCE: Worth keeping an eye on for further momentum after the big day on Friday. 
* LI: Potential resistance on the daily chart around 34. 
* AVXL: Seeing strong volume and price action in premarket, worth keeping an eye on for further momentum. Seeing lots of volatility, just make sure not to chase trades. 

Gapping DOWN:

* BA: Potential support level right around 245. Could retract to 240 if it drops below 244. 
* CCL:  Gapping down below SMA(50). Potential support level at 27. 
* MOXC: Could retrace down to the 16 level, particularly if it can't get back above 20. 

**Market Outlook:**

Stocks are looking at a mixed open, after finishing off last week on a strong note. SPY is trading a bit under 427, with the potential to set new ATH once again. DIA is trading right around 344, hovering right around that support/resistance level. Tech stocks are showing some strength, with QQQ trading a bit over 350. Gold, silver, and crude oil are all slightly down at the moment. EV stocks are somewhat mixed this morning. 

Some important news came out regarding CRISPR technology this weekend, so gene-editing stocks will be a hot topic today and likely throughout the week. Worth keeping an eye on NTLA, CRSP, BEAM, EDIT, etc.

Remember to use proper risk management, by making sure you size appropriately for your account and have a plan for every trade you enter (both for taking profits and cutting losses). Happy trading everyone :)"

stocks,"PHM Due diligence 

PHM is poised for success with the current housing shortage.  They have the reserve capital and access to cheap capital from their LOC that will allow them to accommodate the inevitable demand for more housing units.  

What differentiates residential construction from riets is that Riets seek to capitalized rising housing prices and charge higher rents to maximize profits.  Residential construction is creating value and in PHMs case, doing it in an affordable way while using durable materials and strategic locations.  

The housing shortage is a part of a bigger problem - too much demand.  A shortage leads to rising prices, and in the current economy, this will work both ways for PHM.  

They will sell homes for higher, their assets will appreciate, and they will benefit from building more homes for at least 3 years (inflation and interest rates will start getting sweaty in 2024).  For a short period of time, debt and capital obligations will rise but then revenue, net income, and balance sheet size will all increase.  This probably won’t increase margins because they already have competitive margins and CAPEX will be higher anyways.  

There are a number of alternatives to PHM, notably MDC which is extremely similar but about 1/4 the size of PHM.  Both will do before inflation becomes visible with rising rates, and there will be significant growth, probably 25% YOY.  

I have about 5k cash in my investments account and $500 in PHM.  I have 3600 in a margin account.  If you guys convince me, I’ll move my cash into my margin account and buy some long term calls."

stocks,"$BA — Citing a serious flight test incident and lack of design maturity, FAA slows Boeing 777X certification https://www.seattletimes.com/business/boeing-aerospace/citing-a-serious-flight-test-incident-and-lack-of-design-maturity-faa-slows-boeing-777x-certification/

In yet another blow to Boeing, the Federal Aviation Administration last month formally denied the jet maker permission to move forward with a key step in certifying its forthcoming giant widebody airplane, the 777X.

In a sternly worded letter dated May 13, which was reviewed by The Seattle Times, the FAA warned Boeing it may have to increase the number of test flights planned and that certification realistically is now more than two years out, probably in late 2023.

That could push the jet’s entry into commercial service into early 2024, four years later than originally planned.

The FAA cited a long litany of concerns, including a serious flight control incident during a test flight on Dec. 8, 2020, when the plane experienced an “uncommanded pitch event” — meaning the nose of the aircraft pitched abruptly up or down without input from the pilots.

Boeing has yet to satisfy the FAA that it has fully understood and corrected what went wrong that day.

The letter was signed by Ian Won, the manager of the local FAA office that judges whether Boeing has met all regulatory standards. He also told Boeing that a critical avionics system proposed for the airplane does not meet requirements.

And he expressed concern about proposed modifications involving late changes to both software and hardware in the electronics of the jet’s flight controls.

“The aircraft is not yet ready,” Won wrote. “The technical data required for type certification has not reached a point where it appears the aircraft type design is mature and can be expected to meet the applicable regulations.”

An FAA official, who asked not to be identified in order to speak freely, said the drag on 777X certification is now “the subject of a lot of attention” at high levels both within the agency and at Boeing.

Boeing’s last all-new jet, the 787, had to be grounded in 2013 when its batteries smoldered in flight. The next new plane, the derivative 737 MAX, was grounded for 21 months starting in 2019 after flawed new flight controls caused two fatal crashes.

Now the forthcoming 777X is having a troubled certification process. Is this just the FAA getting tough because of all the scrutiny?

The FAA official said that even if the MAX crashes hadn’t happened, the list of serious issues now raised about the 777X would merit rigorous regulatory attention.

Within the FAA, the person said, “there’s a general feeling that Boeing has kind of lost a step,” referring to the slide away from a historic reputation for engineering prowess.

And because of all the missteps, the official added, “the days of Boeing being able to say to the FAA ‘Just trust us’ are long gone.”

In a statement Friday, Boeing said it “remains fully focused on safety as our highest priority throughout 777X development.”

The airplane is undergoing “a comprehensive test program to demonstrate its safety and reliability … to ensure we meet all applicable requirements,” Boeing added.

The FAA in a statement said safety drives its decisions and timelines.

“The FAA will not approve any aircraft unless it meets our safety and certification standards,” the agency said.

FAA exasperated

Boeing launched the 777X at the Dubai Air Show in the fall of 2013, and at that time targeted 2020 as the year it would enter service.

Set to replace the Boeing 747 jumbo and Airbus A380 superjumbo passenger planes — which are no longer built — as the largest airliner in production, the 777X is a stretch version of the successful 777 passenger airliner featuring a new, superlong, carbon composite wing with folding tips and the largest jet engines ever built.

Boeing invested more than $1 billion in a new composites fabrication plant in Everett to build the wings.

Inside the main Everett assembly building, Boeing also installed state-of-the-art, automated stations to robotically assemble the wings — equipment designed by Mukilteo-based engineering company Electroimpact — and completely changed the way the 777 fuselage and wings come together to make assembly more flexible and efficient.

The first of two 777X models and the largest — the 777-9X, which carries 426 passengers in a two-class configuration — made its first flight in January 2020, kicking off the test flight program.

By now, four test planes are flying out of Boeing Field and at least 17 more 777Xs destined for customers Emirates, Lufthansa, Qatar Airways and All Nippon Airways have rolled out of the factory.

Boeing will have to park those production aircraft and any more built from now through at least late 2023 until certification allows their delivery.

The FAA’s letter on the status of 777X certification is addressed to Tom Galantowicz, the head of Boeing’s internal organization consisting of engineers and managers who act as proxies for the federal agency, tasked with testing and verifying that a new airplane design meets safety standards.

The letter denies Boeing a specific approval for the 777-9X called “Type Inspection Authorization” readiness. Without this, Boeing cannot put FAA personnel on board flight tests and begin to collect certification data.

The wording suggests a degree of exasperation with Boeing pushing for TIA when the FAA deems it far from ready.

“The FAA and Boeing have been discussing the TIA readiness of the Boeing Model 777-9 in numerous meetings over the past nine months,” the letter reads, adding that despite Boeing’s assertion that proceeding with TIA “warrants consideration,” the FAA in contrast “considers that the aircraft is not yet ready.”

The letter then lists a host of shortfalls in Boeing’s readiness.

FAA demands data, not promises

Asked about the test flight that experienced the “uncommanded pitch event” in December, Boeing said the plane went on to land safely and that engineers investigated the root cause and have developed a major software update to fix the problem.

In the meantime, until that’s approved, Boeing has given the test pilots instructions on how to avoid the incident recurring so that test flights can continue.

Yet the FAA clearly isn’t satisfied with Boeing’s promise of a software fix.

“After the uncommanded pitch event, the FAA is yet to see how Boeing fully implements all the corrective actions identified by the root cause investigation,” the letter reads.

“Software load dates are continuously sliding and the FAA needs better visibility into the causes of the delays,” it states.

To confirm “the maturity and safety/airworthiness of the aircraft,” the FAA demands comprehensive and documented reviews of the changes resulting from the investigation into the incident, to ensure that a similar problem “will not happen in the future and this is not a systemic issue.”

The FAA separately highlights concern over a critical piece of new avionics on the jet — the Common Core System, a set of shared computing resources critical to the functioning of multiple airplane systems.

Won notes that Galantowicz conceded in a letter to the FAA earlier in May that the CCS has incomplete software and does not meet TIA requirements.

Citing a “lack of data” and the absence of a Preliminary Safety Assessment for the FAA to review, the agency’s letter declares that Boeing hasn’t even met its own process requirements.

Boeing’s CCS “review dates have continuously slid over a year,” the letter notes.

In turning down the 777X for TIA readiness, the FAA also cited a finding that the supplier of the avionics provided “inadequate peer review” in a safety analysis “resulting in inconsistencies … and incorrect reuse of 787 data.”

GE Aviation’s plant in Grand Rapids, Michigan, supplies the CCS, which builds upon the similar common core avionics system it designed for the 787.

GE, which touts the CCS as the “central nervous system and brain” of the airplane, deferred comment to Boeing.

Demand for 777X currently near zero

Another problem for the FAA is Boeing’s proposal of late changes to the 777X flight control system.

“Boeing is proposing modifications that will involve firmware and hardware changes to the actuator controls electronics of the Flight Control System,” the FAA states. “Boeing needs to ensure the changes do not introduce new, inadvertent failures modes.”

Other pending modifications to the design of systems around the jet’s horizontal tail or stabilizer, which controls the pitch of the airplane, will change the crew alerts that flag certain system failures.

“Design maturity is in question as design changes are ongoing and potentially significant,” the letter states.

Separately, the letter states in passing that the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) has also “not yet agreed on a way forward” with regard to 777X certification.

In an emailed response Friday, EASA spokesperson Janet Northcote said the agency is “cooperating closely with the FAA” on 777X certification.

“We are looking closely at the technical files with the FAA and Boeing and this work is still ongoing,” she said.

The FAA’s letter told Boeing that because of the gaps in the 777X technical data, it anticipates a significant increase in the required level of testing and analysis, “and the potential to increase the number of certification flight tests that will need to take place.”

The letter concludes by requesting that Galantowicz’s unit “close these gaps” before submitting any further requests for TIA approval and that “based on the information from Boeing,” 777X certification is realistically more than two years out, in “mid to late 2023.”

Ironically, the only positive for Boeing in this situation is that — because of the pandemic’s destruction of international air travel demand — no airline in the world wants a 777X right now.

When international travel begins to pick up again post-pandemic, airlines will begin service with smaller jets like Boeing’s long-range 787 until long-haul air travel gradually returns to a level approaching what was typical in 2019.

Yet at a Bernstein Research industry conference this month, Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun doubled down on the 777X despite all the setbacks. Once the jet is certified, he said, “it will have a 40- or 50-year run, and I think it will be one of the great runs of all time.”

“I have lots of confidence in it,” Calhoun said. “We love it.”

Boeing’s website lists 320 orders for the 777X, though because of the delays airline customers will have the option to cancel some of those and may switch to smaller Boeing jets.

Dubai-based Emirates, the largest 777X customer, reduced its initial order for 150 aircraft to 115, swapping out 35 of the 777Xs for 30 much less expensive 787s.

The original 777 flight test program in the mid 1990s, from first flight to certification, took 10 months. For the 737 MAX, that period was just over 13 months. During the problem-ridden and much delayed development of the 787, first flight to certification took just over 20 months.

The 777X is currently set to reach certification almost four years after first flight.

Citing the delays in getting the plane certified, Emirates airline President Tim Clark has said he doesn’t expect any 777X deliveries until 2024.

Realistically, that’s the earliest any global carrier might want to take delivery of such a huge aircraft. Four years late, that’s when the 777X may finally be ready."

As I said, the List will not be updated every month, the idea was to see how those stocks perform over 3-12 months, if someone decided to buy all top 50 at a certain time, in this case May 27.

Aside from top 50 highest rated, there are also other top 50 categories like ""Top 50 Value"", ""Top 50 Growth"" etc, for comparison."

stocks,"Rad - The Unbiased information you need to make a proper decision, information from the CEO to cash flows to debt, but simple. Good luck Happy Sunday everyone, and thank you very much for giving a few minutes of your precious time to read this post. I will not bore you with tons of data on Rite Aid, symbol RAD but I will cut to many key points that are unbiased so you can make a decision. But I do want everyday traders to see many of the key points..

I have traded RAD quite alot in 2021, I am a day trader. Most recently I made some trades on Thursday and still have 1 block of shares at 17.45.

RAD in terms of footprint in the US is the 3rd largest pharmacy in the US. 1st is CVS, 2nd is Walgreens. At current date they have about 2,500 stores after making a cash purchase of Bartel for under 100 million for drug stores in WA. This chain in WA was already profitable so this was indeed a very good acquisition. 

In 2017 Walgreens purchased exactly 1,932 stores from RAD for 4.4 billion dollars in cash. At that time in 2017, RAD was bleeding cash..... RAD had atrocious cash flows, was losing tons of money and had roughly 8.5 billion in debt.. Walgreens had tried to buy RAD completely but the government was against this. The coupon bond on their loan was closer to 10%......... Now RAD 2,500 stores strong is valued at 900 million as of this writing. They have 3 billion in debt at 6% rate. This matters so that you can see the finances have gotten better, but even this debt with the market cap, the better performing stores has the CAP + DEBT at under 4 billion.....remember Walgreens purchased 1,932 stores for 4.4 billion in 2017.

The old CEO of RAD really did RAD in, believe it or not RAD was actually close to a 100 billion dollar company, the one that sits at 900 million now! Just check a chart. John Standley first took SAV On.... which went bankrupt. He often hires all his buddies and then the ship sinks...... He actually tried to get RAD to merge with Albertsons when Walgreens buy out failed. When the new CEO Heyward Donigan came aboard about 2 years ago, it gave me reason to take a look at RAD again. Onboard she was given a $530,00 salary with many types of bonuses, that will be important later but right now I am trying to focus on the turn around. At this time 6-7 quarters ago RAD was under $5 and I was happily trading it.. While she has been on board she has dropped the debt by 4-5 billion. The company is now profitable again. She has lowered the coupon bonds, made a large acquisition. A complete redesign. If you take a look at the last 6 quarters you will see where she has beat on the bottom line..... .ALL 6!!!  You would think the stock as well as her should be rewarded..

The past 2 quarters she has revised down guidance...... only to beat...... I am wondering if she is doing what we call ""Sandbagging"" not worried about the stock price for now, but making guidance easy to easily beat. I did some digging which took me time and I found her pay package as well as a breakdown when she joined in 2019. She made 8.3 million in bonus for 2020....... Unfortunately we do not know what the board votes for her to receive bonuses.....In 2019 she received onboard bonus for joining the team... It says in the SEC document that the board will vote each year to determine how/what she needs to do to achieve the bonus..... it could be the bottom line earnings which I am not sure... but if that is the case it make sense for her to lower guidance each quarter and beat easily. However, short term the stock will suffer.

In 2021 for full year the company is expecting revenues of 25+ billion and is expecting to lose about 20 million. Her lowered guidance for 2022 called for earnings before interest+taxes of 450 million.. Analysts had it at 500.... So outside of interest on the 3 billion and now a lower rate near 6% they are expected to make 450 million.... that sounds good to me! I believe they will come in higher but you can do your own research.

Finally, you must ask yourself, in the past 4 quarters is this company doing better now over last year? How were earnings? What do the financials say? Is this stock worth 16.50 = 900 million or more? Going forward do I feel it should be higher or lower? Do I have this confidence to buy now? Has the ship turned?

Feel free to share thoughts and thanx for your time.."

Deep Dive - a great business that has recently been oversold over transient factors Original Post at [https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/o3a7ng/lzb\_lazboy\_inc\_deep\_dive\_a\_great\_business\_that/](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/o3a7ng/lzb_lazboy_inc_deep_dive_a_great_business_that/)

 Hello everyone, please see below my DD analysis on La-Z-Boy ($LZB). I would love to hear everyone's opinion.

**What Does La-Z-Boy Do?**

La-Z-Boy is one of the largest furniture manufactures in the United States. They are based in Monroe, Michigan, and they make home furniture, including upholstered recliners, sofas, stationary chairs, lift chairs, and sleeper sofas.

La-Z-Boy furniture is sold in thousands of retail residential outlets in the United States and Canada and is manufactured and distributed under license in other countries including the United Kingdom, Australia, Germany, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Turkey, and South Africa. La-Z-Boy holds US and international patents on more than 200 different styles and mechanisms. They employ approximately 9400 workers at this time.

La-Z-Boy Incorporated is divided into three reportable operating segments: the Upholstery Group, the Casegoods Group, and the Retail Group.

The Upholstery Group primarily manufactures and sells upholstered furniture to furniture retailers and proprietary stores. This includes recliners and motion furniture, sofas, lift chairs, loveseats, chairs, ottomans, and sleeper sofas.

The Casegoods Group primarily sells manufactured or imported wood furniture to furniture retailers, including tables, chairs, entertainment centers, headboards, dressers, accent pieces, and some coordinated upholstered furniture.

The Retail Group consists of 70 company-owned stores in the US. The Retail Group sells mainly upholstered furniture to end consumers through the retail network.

In July 2018 La-Z-Boy also acquired online furniture company Joybird for an undisclosed amount.

**The bull case**

* **Reason #1 - Oversold - It is trading well below fair value after being dumped over the past 2 days -** [Nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/an-intrinsic-calculation-for-la-z-boy-incorporated-nyse%3Alzb-suggests-its-21-undervalued) published an article 2 days ago saying the stock was trading 21% below value when it was trading at $42. Now it is at $36, the long-term support, which makes it approximately 33% below fair value. What is the reason for the selloff? In their earnings call, they issued a warning about a temporary negative impact to profit margins in the short term due to raw material price increases right now. However, they also said these issues will be offset by previously announced pricing actions as the company works through its immense backlog in the back half of the year. So basically, the selloff is an overreaction as their earnings report came out the same day Chairman Powell did his press conference and caused the whole market to dump.
* **Reason #2 - The stock will recover soon because it does this -** Because this stock has a relatively low market cap any negative news causes a dump that soon recovers. Simply looking at the chart over the past 6 months will show other such instances including the last major dump to this support level on February 1 and the subsequent recovery by 10%+ in only 8 days and a 20%+ recovery in just over a month after that.
* **Reason #3 - Never before seen boom in home furnishings -** Warren Shoulberg, a senior editor at Forbes, noted that LZB is the poster child for the boom in home furnishings sales. [r/investing](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/) does not allow linking to Forbes due to blog-style articles being published there so I will simply point out some salient points from the story -

&gt;If you want to know how real the boom in home furnishings sales is and how much America is spending to make their homes nicer, all you have to do is ask La-Z-Boy.By one measurement that the company uses, “written same-store sales” for the entire Galleries network doubled, increasing 100% for the quarter. For the year, those sales were up 31%.

Their CEO noted the following in the earnings call (also covered at Forbes) -

&gt;For the fiscal 2021 fourth quarter, record sales led to all-time record profits driven by increased production capacity, excellent performance by our company-owned La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries stores, and continued growth and profitability at Joybird.Fiscal 2022 is off to a great start with continued robust written order rates and a record backlog, setting us up well for a strong year of shipments ahead.

* **Reason #4** \- **LZB beat on all important metrics including EPS and revenue as per their June 15 earnings report** \- [**https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/LZB/earnings/**](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/LZB/earnings/)
* **Reason #5** \-**Despite LZB being an iconic furniture brand it is currently cheaper than the furniture industry average thanks to the recent selloff -** [**https://www.zacks.com/stock/chart/LZB/fundamental/pe-ratio-ttm**](https://www.zacks.com/stock/chart/LZB/fundamental/pe-ratio-ttm)
* **Reason #6 - Dividend-paying stock -** LZB suspended their dividend last year due to the pandemic but it has been reinstated as of this quarter. Part of the recent selloff was possibly also because the dividend was just paid this month. If they follow the same trend as they always have in years prior to COVID they should be expected to announce their next dividend in late August with dividend payment in early-mid September. Here is their dividend history-

[https://www.streetinsider.com/dividend\_history.php?q=lzb](https://www.streetinsider.com/dividend_history.php?q=lzb)

**The Bear Case**

* **Reason #1 - Continued global supply chain issues. Raw material prices skyrocket even higher -** The primary reason for the selloff appears to be management's warning about a temporary negative impact to profit margins in the short term due to raw material price increases. LZB's problems could be exacerbated if inflation continues to run hot and raw material prices skyrocket even higher.
* **Reason #2 - Suspension of dividends again -** LZB management suspended their dividend for 4 quarters due to Covid and only recently reinstated it last quarter. A major supply chain disruption or other internal issues could cause them to suspend it again.

**What are the transient factors that have affected the price of the stock?**

I am adding this section to clarify this point. I will quote directly from the earnings call which can be read in its entirety here-

[https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/06/16/la-z-boy-incorporated-lzb-q4-2021-earnings-call-tr/](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/06/16/la-z-boy-incorporated-lzb-q4-2021-earnings-call-tr/)

This is what caused the selloff-

&gt;Regarding production capacity, demand trends remained strong across the business with backlog at record levels, providing for a long tail. We anticipate ongoing incremental increases in capacity through fiscal 2022 as new assembly cells are added and efficiencies improve, which will result in continued incremental progress on delivered sales. However, we expect temporary significant pressures on profit margins in the first half of fiscal '22 compared to the very strong profit margin of this Q4. We expect to face ongoing global supply chain disruptions and escalating raw material and freight costs, which will cause volatility in results and will eventually be offset by our already announced pricing actions in the back half of the year as we work through our backlog.

Analysts clarified this point further during the call:

&gt;**Bobby Griffin** \-- *Raymond James &amp; Associates, Inc. -- Analyst*  
So Bob, I just want to circle right back quickly to your comments about the 300 bps of margin pressure just to make sure we're all on the same page of what's that referencing in kind of what timeframe. So is that in reference to the 10% EBIT margin that was posted in 4Q? And are you saying that 1Q and 2Q of 2021 should be down about 300 bps at the highest level possible versus first at 10% if raw material headwinds were as strong as they could be?  
**Robert Lucian** \-- *Chief Financial Officer*  
That's correct.  
**Bobby Griffin** \-- *Raymond James &amp; Associates, Inc. -- Analyst*  
Okay. And then -- so for both quarters kind of the same type of trajectory off the 10%. I mean, that would put 2Q though below where kind of it was in the October of '19 quarter which was 7.5%. Is that all just raw material related or mix of business or could we end up at 7% EBIT margins below than kind of where we were two years ago even?  
**Robert Lucian** \-- *Chief Financial Officer*  
It's mostly the raw material impacts that we're seeing. And again, we've taken pricing and it's taking a while for that pricing to work its way through. So it will work its way through by toward the end of Q2 into Q3 and that's when our margins will start improving.  
**Bobby Griffin** \-- *Raymond James &amp; Associates, Inc. -- Analyst*  
Okay. All right, that's helpful. And then trying to -- usually 1Q is the seasonally weak quarter, but with this large of a backlog that you have, I think in the 10-K it was $617 million or something called out. I mean, is the right way to think about the potential revenue side of things here in 1Q basically 12, 13 of what you delivered in 4Q or is there something wrong with kind of using that as an estimate?  
**Robert Lucian** \-- *Chief Financial Officer*  
I don't think there's anything wrong using that as an estimate.

As such, their margins may be lower this quarter if raw material prices continue to be as high as they've been but they've already taken actions that will cause this pressure to lift by the end of Q2 going into Q3 and while margins may be lower the actual revenue and profits will again beat records thanks to the immense backlog in orders that they're now fulfilling thanks to the additional capacity they have added.

**Financials &amp; Valuation**

LZB balance sheet can be viewed at [https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/quote/LZB/balance-sheet?p=LZB](https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/quote/LZB/balance-sheet?p=LZB) for reference to what I state below.

* LZB is a profitable business with a consistent adjusted EBITDA margin of around 10% which is in line with industry standards -[https://csimarket.com/Industry/industry\_Profitability\_Ratios.php?ind=407](https://csimarket.com/Industry/industry_Profitability_Ratios.php?ind=407)
* Debt-free - LZB is debt-free.
* Short-term assets ($926.2M) exceed short-term liabilities ($611.7M).
* Short-term assets ($926.2M) exceed long-term liabilities ($392.5M).
* Regarding valuation, I have already covered this in the bull case where LZB is now nearly 33% undervalued as per the [Nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/an-intrinsic-calculation-for-la-z-boy-incorporated-nyse%3Alzb-suggests-its-21-undervalued) calculation. The Nasdaq story only says 21% because it was published when the stock price was still $42 and it is now trading around $36.

Based on all this I believe LZB is a great business and iconic brand that is currently trading well below fair value. I believe this represents a great investment opportunity.

**TL;DR:** LZB stock faced a selloff this week because management warned that record high raw material prices would affect their bottom line in the short term. Management also noted that these issues will be offset by previously announced pricing actions as the company works through its immense backlog in the back half of the year. Considering this, I believe the stock is oversold as it is considered as much as 33% undervalued as per [Nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/an-intrinsic-calculation-for-la-z-boy-incorporated-nyse%3Alzb-suggests-its-21-undervalued) at current prices which represents a great investment opportunity."
stocks,"Want to hear from those who day trade large % of their accounts on a single stock that runs for the day and exit by closing bell While this strategy has its own pros and cons I am wondering if people use it and if so, what has been their experience and how they feel about it compared to other strategies.

What I like about it is that you get to stay liquid all the time and don't need to hold anything overnight + since you are going in heavy the returns must be good enough compared to what you would have made if you had just put in 5% of your money.

And obviously the cons being if you accidentally catch the top or if anything goes south right around the entry price, you stop out with a loss.

Since I haven't tried this strategy myself, I am sure I might be missing a lot of things which is why I am interested to know what has and what hasn't worked for those who have gone down this route. TIA.

Also I am referring to large cap stocks, not penny stocks. E.g. if PTON has a 5% day, you day trade it and catch like 3-4% on the way up and get out end of day.

\- The recent Supreme Court Case did not *look* good for Fannie Mae with regards to the lawsuit.

\- The case however did seem to be instrumental in the independence away from the US Government.

stocks,"The Greatest Investment Advice Ive Ever Read Theres a great interview with David Tepper on CNBC from just after the GFC in 08 where he kind of just puts his balls on the table for Becky and Joe to ogle at.

It got me thinking about one of the greatest bits of advice i have ever heard. It basically is, invest like you have the money to individually move a stock. If you can get into this psyche you will win more than you lose. Once you get into the mind state of the Teppers and Ackmans, you will start to understand how financial markets truly operate.

stocks,"Leveraging portfolio… Another post on here was questioning general investment strategy and this brought the question of property into the equation, and it prompted me to get your views on this…

Property can be a great investment generating both capital growth and income. But it’s a pain in the arse. I’m in a senior position in a fairly substantial private property investment company, but I have no interest in owning buy to let property, despite doing this for living.

I suspect people do it because they can put down a relatively small deposit, mortgage finance the remainder, acquire a substantial asset and watch it grow, whilst also paying an income.

My question is, why not do the same with equities?

Assuming I only invest in equities with a margin requirement of 25% then I can have a portfolio 4 x larger than I could otherwise have, and at a fairly low rate of interest, a rate comparable to buy to let mortgage rates.

Im mid thirties, have about £280k ($389k) free cash at the moment and most is invested in equities. I earn a decent salary and live fairly modestly, so a good chunk of future earnings can also be saved or invested. No large future expenses anticipated. Own my house in London (albeit with mortgage).

So why not treat equities like property, leverage it, and profit in the long run in a much more liquid market, with lower costs and less hassle than property.

Obviously everyone’s personally circumstances are different but I could definitely tie this money up for 10 years so what good reasons are there not to do this. I am aware I need to leave a good chunk of cash free for any margin calls, particularly if the market tanks!"
stocks,"World ETF or slice'n'dice? Hi all!

I have a larger pension from a previous job that I would like to invest long term in world ETFs. I would like my investment to be based on the ESG standards (ex China). I have 30+ years until retirement.

I currently see two options:

1. An easy solution where I pick a Developed markets ETF and an Emerging markets ETF (ex China) \~ 0.2 APR.
2. Construct the Developed markets part from four regional ETFs (USA, Europe, Japan, Pacific ex Japan) and again add Emerging markets \~ 0.1 APR.

A minor issue with option 2 is that Pacific ex Japan doesn't exist as ESG from iShares (where I intend to buy most of my portfolio), but it's only 4% of the market. I also haven't found the Emerging markets ex China as ESG.

Covering Developed markets with regional ETFs would save about 0,1% per annum, but I'm not sure it's worth the hassle. If, at some point, I have to sell part of my investment to pay my taxes from the earnings, or I want to change course a bit, then the allocation will either be skewed, or I'll have to pay extra in brokerage fees to keep the correct allocation between the regional ETFs.

I know some people also advocate for simple portfolios.

Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey (R) announced Tuesday that her state has landed the first graphite processing plant in the U.S.

In a statement, Ivey said Alabama reached an agreement with Westwater Resources Inc., a Colorado-based mineral resources company, to build a plant in Coosa County.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Westwater Resources subsidiary Alabama Graphite Products LLC plans to invest $80 million to help build the first plant in Kellyton, near Alexander City, and a second phase of the project will push the total investment to $124 million.

The construction will start later this year and is slated to be operational by the end of 2022. The the goal of the plant is to produce 7,500 tons of battery-grade graphite each year, according to the statement.

“This plant not only will make Alabama the U.S. leader in graphite production, the go-to place for this important resource in battery manufacturing, it also will elevate our standing even more as a major player in the fast-growing electric vehicle sector,” Ivey said in the statement.

“We’re home to four major auto plants, and the ability to source precious materials in state for the lithium-ion batteries used in electric and hybrid vehicles will be a big plus in attracting other manufacturing jobs to the state.”

\- Enjoy years of superior online privacy with nearly $200 off this VPN...

Westwater Resources CEO Chris Jones said that he’s thankful for Ivey's and other state officials' help on the project. “We look forward to being an active member of the business community here for many years to come,” Jones said. 

The new graphite plant will create 100 full-time jobs and with hourly wages up to $21.25 an hour.

""I have an aggressive portfolio"" - *has a quarter of their portfolio in government bonds and the rest in VTI* 

So while all of this is good and dandy for investment advice, the ridiculous amount of Boglehead anti-risk circlejerking is getting on my nerves. We get it, you figured out the keys to the kingdom - except that has nothing to do with the topic at hand. OP wasn't asking about how to make a retirement fund. He was asking how to generate income which is a completely separate objective from what passive investing is. The right response would be something like a covered call strategy or a high dividend yield investment, not a ""set it and forget it"" portfolio from Vanguard. 

Bogleheads in recent times have become the financial equivalent to Jehova's witness - going door to door about how the world is going to end and how all the stock pickers are peasants who will face the wrath of god when the rapture occurs. 

If you don't want to actively pick stocks, thats ok. Nobody is forcing you too. But please stop telling everyone else that they should do the same. Everyone has a different risk profile and given the amount of teens and 20 years olds on here, their risk tolerance far exceeds anything propogated by the three funds portfolio, and they still have the time to take advantage of that fact. 

This subreddit and every other sub about investing are naturally oriented towards actively managed portfolios. We discuss interesting companies, investment philosophies, and all the ways to manage a hands-on approach to portfolio management. This conversation is the antithesis of passive investment because with passive investing, all you do is buy some funds and that's it - no more discussion. Nothing else is necessary because the philosophy of passive investing is ""set it and forget it"" except Bogleheads forgot the second part, and they want everyone else to do the same apparently."

stocks,"How Stocks Are Valued Part 1: Discounted Cash Flow I saw a question on this sub yesterday about why stocks are valuable, so I thought I would do a write-up of what I learned about stocks in business school. But first, an important concept:

# The Time Value of Money, Present Value, and Discount Rate

**A loan to a friend**

Imagine if you loaned someone $1000 for a year. You probably want to be paid back with interest. This interest compensates you for losing access to that money for a year, during which you could have deposited it at a bank, invested it, or even spent it.

The long story short is that $1000 today is worth more than $1000 tomorrow because of the flexibility and options that you have with today's money. We can say that the ***Present Value*** of $1000 next year is less than $1000 today. This concept is also known as ***The Time Value of Money.***

**An Example With T-Bills**

Treasury bills (T-Bills) are essentially loans to the US Government, but the amount to be repaid is fixed. T-Bills are typically denominated in $1000s, which is the amount the government will repay when the bond matures. 

An investor can typically buy a T-Bill for less than the full $1000 on the open market. The investor makes money because she purchased the future $1000 payment at a ***discount.*** This discount exists because money today is worth more than money tomorrow. How do you convert between the two? Using the appropriately named ***Discount Rate***, or the required rate of return. 

The average investor wants to make money from lending money, even to the US Government. If investors want a 1% return, then $100 today is the same as $101 next year.

We can similarly price T-Bills: If the required rate of return is 1%, and the bond will pay $1000 in a year, then the ***Present Value*** of the T-Bill is about $990. This is because the $990 investment will grow by 1% into $1000.

***--------------------------------------------------------***

Are you still awake? Good. This is the fun part.

# So What Are Stocks Anyway?

Stocks represent partial ownership of a company. A company is divided into units of stock called shares, and as a shareholder, you are entitled to a fraction of the company's assets (after all debts are repaid) and any future profits.

**So Why Does a Stock Have Value?**

Part of a stock's value comes from its book value (the value of all company assets minus all company debt) but this clearly only a small fraction of that price ( the average price-to-book ratio for the companies in the S&amp;P500 is about 4.5). ***The remainder of the stock value comes from the future earnings of a company.***

Similar to how the price of a T-Bill is the present value of a future payment, a large part of a stock's value comes from the present value of future earnings. Analysts will project (and discount) a company's future earnings, add the book value, and arrive at an estimate of the stock's value.

# Oversimplified DCF Example:

The Pear Company makes $100 a year risk-free. For simplicity's sake, it has $200 in assets and no debt. Your local bank is offering to double your money in your savings accounts every year, so you figure 100% is a good discount rate to use.

The Pear Company will make $100 next year (Year 1), which is worth $50 today ($50 doubles into $100 at the bank in a year). In Year 2, The Pear Company's earnings are only worth $25 to you today, and so on. If you add the present value of all future cash flows together, you'll arrive at $100. 

You can find the company value by adding the value of its assets ($200) with the present value of its future earnings ($100).  If Pear issues 100 shares, each will be worth $3.

[Of course, even simple DCF Models IRL look a little scarier than the above example.](https://imgur.com/a/DzMQHHT)

# But What Makes The Stock Valuable To Me?

You might have noticed that dividends aren't really taken into account at all. How are you supposed to get any real money from a company whose stock pays no dividends?

Unpaid dividends don't just disappear. Management can decide to reinvest these profits to grow their income. This results in a larger stock price over time. The company might also just decide to keep the cash on its balance sheet. This results in a larger book value, and the stock price will increase to reflect that.

You can sell some stock to create your own ""dividend"" if you'd like; you will own a smaller percentage of the company, but because profits were not distributed to shareholders, the company has gotten bigger.

**But What Makes The Stock Valuable To The Next Guy?**

Eventually, the company's value will be returned to shareholders. This could happen in several ways:

1. Dividends are paid out in the future, returning capital to investors
2. The company is acquired or goes private, and shareholders either receive cash or stock in the acquiring company. Typically, the acquisition price is determined by, among other things, the present value of all future earnings of the company,
3. The company might also just decide to stop operating and liquidate its assets. Shareholders will receive all assets the company owns (after paying its debt)."

stocks,"The Weekly DD - WISH: The shopping mall in your pocket **Overview**

WISH controls the most popular shopping mobile application in the world. In short, the company is a direct-to-consumer online retailer. However, a few key features differentiate it from its competition:

* WISH does not operate any brick-and-mortar locations
* WISH does not target popular branded items in its offerings
* WISH oftentimes works directly with the manufacturers or independent sellers instead of the wholesaler

Let’s go through this list to understand why this is a significant differentiation. 

* WISH not operating any brick-and-mortar locations allows it to maintain low capital expenditures (CAPEX) and frees up its cash flows.
* WISH’s focus on unbranded items allows it to compete in a more niche market that has not been taken over by other e-commerce giants. This is a space that WISH dominates. 
* WISH’s decision to work directly with manufacturers rather than wholesalers allows it to procure its product catalog at a much cheaper price point than any competitor which it then passes on to its customers. With independent sellers, WISH offers a more unique product catalog than its competitors.

These three features combined defines how it interacts with its customer base. WISH targets mostly younger, low to middle income households. It offers cheap and unbranded products, an area that was historically ignored by larger e-commerce companies. Even their strategy to be a mobile app reflects this. According to Pew Research, lower-income shoppers accessed the internet solely through their smartphone at a rate double the other income brackets.

**The Future of E-commerce is Mobile**

E-commerce is not a new term. Years ago, a CEO at Sears might have argued that people prefer an in-store experience. Today, that same CEO would finally admit that he was incorrect in underestimating the prominence of e-commerce. However, what most people do not know is that e-commerce is still in its growth phase. Although due to COVID, 2021 represented one of the highest growth years ever for e-commerce. Its growth in Q1 2020 over tripled the growth in Q3 and Q4 of 2019. In 2020, online spending represented 21% of the total retail sales while in 2019, online spending represented only 16%.

Furthermore, the growth is mostly being captured by the American and European markets. This is especially useful for WISH as over 80% of its global sales is coming from these two regions.

A few macro trends are expected to drive e-commerce for the next decade:

* Mobile shopping: COVID-19 accelerated the shift to online shopping by over 5 years! Mobile commerce or m-commerce is expected to continue breaking out over the next few years, rising at a rate of 25.5% compounded annual growth rate. Its expected that by 2024, m-commerce will represent 44% of all e-commerce transactions accounting for \~$500B in sales.
* Big data and AI: A key advantage in e-commerce is going to be in data whether that is to power a recommendation feature or to power targeted advertisements, data is the new gold for e-commerce companies. Increasingly, the ability to personalize the shopping experience per user is becoming a crucial differentiator. BCG reports that proper personalization can increase sales by over 25%.

**WISH, More than Just a Retailer**

WISH has a few main product lines:

* Online retail store, the Wish mobile application
* ProductBoost, a marketing service on the Wish mobile application
* WishLocal, a digital presence service for smaller brick-and-mortar retailers
* Wish Express, a logistics service for customer delivery

**1. WISH as an online retail store**

As an online retail store, WISH is growing quickly in all areas. As of 2021, its revenue per active user increased 76% YOY, led by an increase in orders over $20 which increased over 50% in Q1 2021. However, total monthly active users declined 7% YOY which may indicate some saturation in their market.

As stated before, the key differentiator in the future of online retail is going to be personalization through big data and AI. WISH is uniquely positioned to capture this core advantage. At its very inception, WISH has always recognized the value of data. As of 2020, WISH catalogued the following data points:

* 100M+ monthly active users: their age, gender, location, etc.
* 150M+ activities on Wish: clicks, scrolls, items sold, etc.
* 500K+ merchant data: refund rates, ship times, etc.
* 640M+ items shipped: ratings, pictures, etc.

Through this enormous warehouse of data, WISH was able to build one of the most effective recommendation engines in the world. WISH sees **70%** of their sales coming from purchases not involved with a search query. This speaks volume on the effectiveness of their data science platform and their ability to understand their customer, which in turn enables…

**2. ProductBoost, the AdWords for Shopping**

By proving out a deep knowledge of their customer base, WISH can show relevant targeted ads to its user-base. In 2020, 30% of all merchants on WISH used this service to increase their sales which represented $140M of revenue for WISH. The company is very focused in growing this area as it represents a scalable, high-margin service offering for them. As of Q1 of 2021, they are already seeing a 14% increase in sales in this area compared to Q4 of 2019. 

**3. WishLocal, Helping those Behind the Curve**

WishLocal is a service that brick-and-mortar retailers sign up for. Through WishLocal, they agree to become a drop point for WISH products in return for a fee. They will both earn the fee as well as can cross-sell to the customer. This also serves as an incentive point for them to sign onto Wish as a merchant. While WishLocal is not a revenue generating feature, it is a point of differentiation that allows Wish to have a physical presence without the need for heavy investment in brick-and-mortar stores.

**4. Wish Express, Driving Business Forward**

Wish Express is the global logistics service at WISH. They contract out other delivery services from local vendors and stitch it all together into a single product. Like this, they can both improve their own delivery services (shipping-related refunds were down 40+% in 2021) as well as to offer another revenue generating service to their merchants and partners. In 2021, their logistics revenue was \~$250M which represented a 338% increase from the previous year.

**Strong Balance Sheet, Weak Income Statement**

WISH is a risky company, and this is reflected in their finances. They have a cash reserve of $2B which is balanced out with nearly $900M in current liabilities. In 2020, they issued $1B in new stock whose funds were used to absorb a $750M net operating loss. This represents a major risk for the company as an operating loss of this magnitude will not be sustainable for more than 2 years.

The $750M operating loss was mostly made up of an extremely high marketing expense and a reduction in their gross margins. The SG&amp;A (primarily driven by marketing) expense went up by 40% which corresponds to a 33% increase in sales indicating an inefficient usage of resources.

While the marketing expense can be easily controlled, it’s a little worrisome to see their gross margins reduced from 80% in 2019 to 64% in 2020 especially as they have a long-term goal of 75% margins. If WISH cannot get their margins back and maintains current levels of spending, another share dilution will be necessary next year as well to sustain its balance sheet health.

In 2020 WISH did 2.54 billion in revenue, a 33.7% increase from 2019 revenues. Their trailing twelve month (TTM) gross margin is roughly 60%, which is very good for the e-commerce industry where it is usually closer to the 40% range. Like mentioned above, WISH's SG&amp;A expense is absolutely huge and one of the main factors of why they are burning through cash. 

In their most recent earnings report, WISH management guided revenues of 715-730 million revenue for Q2 2021. What’s concerning is that it’s only 2-4% growth when looking YoY, however, management noted that this is mainly due to the incredible growth they experience the year prior as lockdowns became normalized around the world. This ties back to the debate of whether or not their target market is seeing saturation.

**The Bottom Line**

In many ways, WISH reminds me of an early Amazon. Perhaps their story will end similarly to Amazon as well where they become a global tech giant valued well past where they were as an online retail store. After all, they have many things going for them:

* The most downloaded shopping app in the world
* High market share in the niche unbranded sales space
* Expansion into high margin services

However, there are some warning signs to recognize as to how WISH may not be the next Amazon.

* Amazon already exists and it competes against WISH
* It lost monthly active users in the year it spent the most in marketing
* Its gross margins declined in 2020 (though its been steadily rising beforehand)

For me, I see a company with $1B of extra cash above its current liabilities and revenues of $2B being valued at $8.5B. I believe the $8.5B valuation reflects the risk that WISH incurs burning through $750M of cash in a year (it only happened once, 2019 was much better). If WISH can figure out a way to stem the bleeding of cash or to raise funds without a share dilution, their stock price should rise as a result.

With their focus on data, their considerable market share, and some core high margin products already underway, I believe that WISH is poised for growth in 2021.

**TLDR;**

1. WISH is in the e-commerce space and they are what I would call a ""flea market in your pocket"" that gives you access to thousands of products directly from their mobile app. They do not operate brick and mortar locations, and they do not target branded items which allows them to work directly with manufacturers instead of wholesalers (cutting out the middle man and saving on expenses).
2. WISH is able to dominate this very niche space because the big e-commerce players simply do not care about selling discount items of this type. WISH's customer-base is targeted toward the low-to-middle class which is evident if you go to their site. Many products are under $5 and in unusual categories to say the least.
3. One advantage in WISH's business model is the fact that they create a bridge between the customer and the manufacturer, cutting out the middle-man while maintaining low capital expenditures (CapEx), which free's up their cash flow to spend on things like customer acquisition.
4. When it comes to their fundamentals WISH is a ""risky"" company. They aren't overly indebted, but still hold roughly 900m liabilities compared to their 2B cash reserve. Most of their expenses are marketing expenses and they burn through a significant amount of money on customer acquisition. This might present the risk of new share issuance and dilution should the stock price out-perform in a short period of time.
5. Having said all that, their gross margin (\~60%) is quite healthy. For a company that trades at only 3x sales they have the potential to out-perform the market should they figure out a way to retain customers without spending billions on SG&amp;A expenses. In short, they are doing just under 3 billion in sales and have a market cap of 8.7 billion dollars.

stocks,"Short selling and price discovery Could someone recommend a few papers that highlight the problem of short selling? Besides the problem that is on everyone’s mind with naked short selling. Would there be more efficient price discovery? I see the some info mentioning short selling actually creates more volatility and does not change returns over time.

My question is brought up because I’m thinking of examples such as 
 
1. Bill Ackmans comments with Herbalife. Should some companies fail if it truly was taking advantage of people? (maybe that would be solved with a “fair” market anyways)

2. Would short selling help balance problems during bear markets by slowing the decline or would selling at the top bring the same result anyways?

3. Would we see more bubbles caused from everyone being long?"
stocks,"How does shorting affect a stock? I don't mean the stock's price, I mean the company itself. I keep seeing people saying that short sellers bankrupt companies, but, to my understanding, the only way that they affect the company is through lowering the share price. A lower share price means that the company can raise less money through additional share offerings, but... That's about it, right? 

I also guess it affects more of the intangible aspects like investor confidence and so on, but I still fail to see exactly how short sellers affect the company.

If the company is good enough, eventually it will bounce back up, right? There's a reason why the most shorted companies are some of the most controversial ones. Most of the them have slim chances of performing well or are overvalued.

And, also, if we apply the reverse logic, if a company's share price gets pumped up and kept up, the only thing they can do is raise more money through the shares. However, if their management and business is shit, they're just buying themselves more time before bankruptcy, right?

I've seen the theories about companies that are trading above the fair value actually creating value through share offerings, but at the end of the day it comes down to the underlying business and it's performance. If a company was that good that it only needs money to become an amazing performer, there surely would be some merry bunch of individuals who would give them some. I mean, investors and institutions are spending a fuckton of money supporting companies with a 10% chance of surviving over the next few years and dodgy startups, if they saw a company that only needs cash to perform well, they'd surely recognise the opportunity, right?

I have not actually done any substantial factual research on this although admittedly it's a bit hard to find good resources right now which are not biased. This is purely my own personal understanding. There's plenty of people here who are smarter than me so I was hoping that somebody would have a good answer 😁

Thanks!"
stocks,"Why is it so important for a company to pay dividends?  

Relatively  new to investing doing it for half year but the more i get into it the  less i understand. So why is it so important for some companies to pay  and constantly increase dividends year by year.

As  far as i understand companies need money at the beginning of their life  to cover the expenses and then in exchange they return the profit to  the investors in dividends or buybacks which makes the stock/company  valuable which drives the stock price up so they can issue more shares  if they need money for further investment.

So  this is completely ok but a company like coca-cola, altria, 3m etc.  doesnt really issue any new shares or do something innovative to reform  the company/build factories etc. So does it even matter what their stock  price is? Their net profit would cover all expenses isnt it?

So  why dividend champion stocks keep increasing their dividends each year  why dont they just stop pay dividend and pay the profit to the workers  or to the management or whatever."

its obvious from a quick glance, corsair's Y/Y growth is massive. Clearly seen when comparing its fiscal year/year growth.

theres insane increase in revenue, net revenue, and FCF. Even going positive in net income. this also is after the fact that (unless im misunderstanding this concept on balance sheet) corsair has (relatively speaking to its previous years) insane inventory cash flow.

however, projecting Y/Y growth is hard on this company.

stocks,"Lightning eMotors (ZEV) added to the Russell Microcap Index. Undervalued commercial EV play with sector dominance and strong growth What I like about Lightning eMotors (ZEV) is that they dominate a niche space that stands to grow very quickly. Rather than focusing on ""last-mile” lighter-duty vehicles, which would compete with high volume manufacturers, they use a medium-duty legacy chassis to take advantage of existing “upfit ecosystems” that  class 3-7 fleet commercial fleets actively depend on. This means easy electrification of ambulances, street cleaners, refrigerator trucks, and lifts as well as universal access to easily sourced spare parts for critical maintenance. 

While preserving fleet owners' capital investments, their legacy chassis strategy also gives them a first mover advantage by clearing them of all federal and state safety certifications, thus removing a major time and logistics obstacle.  This is why Lightning eMotors already has over 50% marketshare. 

Because the vehicles are designed for long lifespan and they are expensive to modify, fleet operators commonly change out drive trains rather than buy new vehicles. Now, because of sound economics and government mandates, instead of a new diesel drive train, they are moving to electric. This growing demand is why ZEV is dramatically expanding its Colorado-based facility and is expected to grow 195% CAGR over the next 4 years. 

Overview of some key points:

* First mover advantage — They’ve shipped more than 3x biggest competitor and currently control more than 50% market share in class 3-7 EV.
* Quarterly YoY revenue growth: 560%
* 2021 projected revenue is 100% contracted with pipeline of $800 million in sales
* Zero Debt and Low Capex assembly of vehicles 
* Projected 195% CAGR with $2 billion revenue by 2025 driven by government and corporate mandates to electrify commercial fleets.  That kind of revenue relative to their current $662 million market cap offers a sense of the value proposition, especially with a $67 billion TAM
* As the largest US-owned medium-duty commercial EV company, Lightning eMotors they will uniquely benefit from Biden's recently announced plan to replace entire government vehicle fleet with electric vehicles under the “Buy America” mandate.  The Biden White House says, ""Biden’s order directs federal agencies to purchase zero-emission power and automobiles, such as electric vehicles, as a way to “leverage the federal government’s footprint and buying power to lead by example.”  
* Medium-duty portion of Federal fleet electrification plan is 110,000 vehicles that only Lightning eMotors is currently equipped to handle. This represent a 5x of their entire 2025 projected revenue of $2 billion.  CEO Tim Reeser says they are currently working with USGSA on this new development.
* ZEV already sell to 30 fleets representing 500,000 vehicles and has strategic partnerships and contracts with DHL Express, Amazon, USPS, IKEA, Ford, Shyft, Plug Power, Proterra, BP, Romeo Power, ABC, Borg Warner, Winnebago, and the State of California.  DHL Express is expected to deploy their vehicles in California and New York later this year.
* Use of legacy chassis takes advantage of existing fed and state certifications along with entire medium-duty upfit ecosystem (ambulance, lifts, chillers and spare parts),which is critical for fleet owners. 
* ZEV can build from ground up or re-power drivetrains of existing fleets. Re-powering is most common in this medium-duty class designed for long mileage.  This enables fleet owners to continue using already customized vehicles thus extend the value of significant capital investment.
* Proprietary scalable analytics and proven operational savings for fleet customers.
* Offers fleet financing and patented mobile charging technologies and charging as a service (CAAS) which they are expanding to commercial and government fleets via its Lightning Energy division.
* Large patent portfolio
* Lightning eMotors has the largest commercial electric production facility in the US. Moreover, they are currently doubling their work force and quadrupling their Colorado-based manufacturing facility to meet accelerating demand. “Combined, the expansion and new equipment ensures that we’re ready for continually increasing demand and the growth of the business.”  Expansion plans are fully funded with no need of debt and they’ve signed leased to allow further 5x or more expansion. (1 million square foot campus)
* Oppenheimer analyst team are bullish with a $15 PT (80% upside) using a discounted to peer 6x sales multiple and their more conservative 169% CAGR estimate: “With Lightning's diverse supply chain, demonstrated capability in delivering numerous vehicles types, and optionality on either growing through powertrain development, full vehicle sales, or being a leading integrator of fuel cell-based power systems, we believe ZEV shares offer investors meaningful upside potential.""

Quotes from clients:

“We looked at every brand of commercial EV and vehicle analytics out there, and after intense research, we chose to partner with Lightning eMotors.We require the highest tech vehicles to integrate with our online rental platform, and Lightning’s technology fits us well. We are able to show a compelling return on investment for these vehicles versus their legacy gasoline vehicles for our rental customers.”

–U.S. Fleet Operator

“We have chosen to partner with Lightning to help us achieve our aggressive worldwide sustainability goals. We have started our journey of procuring 1,000’s of zero emission trucks worldwide over the next 5 years and expect that Lightning will be a key supplier for vehicles and charging infrastructure.”

stocks,"GRVI - quick financial analysis of new CBD company IPO One of the top gainers of the past week was Grove Inc. (GRVI) which IPO'd on Thursday. I did a quick financial analysis of the company and would love to get your thoughts.  

Grove is a fully integrated provider of CBD products, meaning they manufacture products in-house, have their own brands as well as provide white label services, and operate their own marketplace. 

[Grove's financial snapshot](https://imgur.com/nLMI8Ya) - honestly they look really impressive for a company of this size, and make me think that the company is undervalued at these prices. All information is taken from the company's [investor presentation](https://groveinc.io/investor-relations/investing-deck/), the [S-1 filing](https://sec.report/Document/0001477932-21-003754/), and [IPO prospectus](https://sec.report/Document/0001477932-21-004256/grove_424b4.htm)

**Some of my key takeaways after going through the financials:**  

* Rapid revenue growth: Grove did $13.4M in revenue in the 9 months ended March 2021, growing from $5.1M in the prior year period (163% growth rate). This growth comes even in a year where Grove was not able to hold any trade shows due to COVID, which have historically brought in over $1M in revenue and are likely to be a big potential driver of growth as the industry increases in popularity
  
* Attractive gross margins: Even at small scale, the company managed 50.5% gross margin in the 2021 9M period, improving from 31.4% in the prior year period. 50%+ gross margin is a great achievement, especially for a smaller company without significant scale advantages, and speaks to the benefits of Grove's fully verticalized approach as well as the profit potential of the CBD market. Gross profit grew 314% YoY driven by a combination the revenue growth and margin expansion
  
* Improving net profitability: In 2021, Grove managed to achieve positive Net Income and Operating Cash Flow. In the 9M period ending March 2021, the company did $260K of Net Income and positive Operating Cash Flow of $98K. This compares to a Net Loss of $4.7M and Operating Cash Flow of -$3.8M in the 2020 9M period. The ability to become cash flow positive this early in the company's history is very impressive and speaks to management's ability to drive profitable growth

**Valuation considerations:**  

* As of Friday 6/25's closing price of $7.86 per share, Grove has a Market Cap of $111.7M. Subtracting cash of ~$13M (based on $2.1M as of 3/31/21 + $11M in IPO proceeds) and adding debt of ~$3M, we get an Enterprise Value of ~$102M

* Based on the previous 9 month period, the company generated ~$4.5M in revenue per quarter. Assuming they will generate the same amount for the quarter ending June 2021, that results in annual revenue of $17.9M. If we apply an assumption of 100% revenue growth rate for the next 12 months (which I believe is conservative given 163% growth rate in the prior year, and in a year with no trade show revenue), we can forecast $35.8M in revenue for the 12 month forward period. This results in an EV/sales multiple of 2.8x

* Based on a [Cannabis industry research report](https://www.valuationresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Cannabis.pdf), median multiples on run-rate revenue are around 7x EV/sales, with even the bottom 25% percentile trading at 5x. At 2.8x, GRVI is undervalued 

* Given Grove’s strong gross margins and improving profitability, it is likely the company is also undervalued on valuation metrics related to Gross Profit, EBITDA, and Free Cash Flow 

**Management team:**  

The last thing I'll mention is the management team. The CEO Allan Marshall is a long-time entrepreneur and executive, having founded Segmentz Inc., a logistics company which eventually became XPO Logistics. The CFO also comes from Segmentz. The quality of this management team seems very strong for the scale of the company. 

These are just some of my initial thoughts, please let me know if there’s anything else you’d like me to dig into more."

stocks,"Barrick Gold ($GOLD) lagging competitors YTD. Short term opportunity? Now I’m not going to pretend that I’m an expert with gold miners (honesty I don’t think anyone can accurately value this industry, just read [Barrick’s](https://s25.q4cdn.com/322814910/files/doc_presentations/2021/05/Barrick-Q1-2021-Results-Presentation.pdf) latest investor presentation which goes into detail about their mining process, it’s extremely complicated) or here to present a 10x opportunity. I’ve been closely following gold prices for a few months now and have seen a lot of discussions around the relationship between inflation and a potential increase in interest rates which would negatively impact gold as investors seek better risk-adjusted yield opportunities in bonds.

Despite interest rate concerns, I still believe gold is a decent hedge given the S&amp;P hitting new all-time highs. The Fed continues to reassure the market that interest rates won’t move until late 2022 at the earliest. In my opinion, inflation may run hot for the next year giving gold a decent tailwind. I know this is a simple macro overview, but let’s move on to the trade opportunity.

I have noticed that Barrick has been lagging its major competitor Newmont this year, why? It already traded at a lower multiple compared to Newmont at the start of the year which makes sense as it has lower operating margins/growth expectations. There doesn’t appear to be an explicit reason for the relative dispersion between the 2 companies’ share price YTD when they have historically been very correlated.

Here are my 2 potential strategies:

#1 Target Price Realization: Go long common stock while selling monthly calls 5-10% above purchase price. Current monthly implied volatility shows about 2-3% monthly premium. Not bad. If I get assigned first month, would re-enter.

#2 Pairs Trade: Go long Barrick ($GOLD) and short Newmont ($NEM) until both securities revert to their mean averages of the past 5 years (89% correlation).

In summary, I strongly believe there is a 15-20% short term opportunity here which may not be groundbreaking but still outperforming the broader market if this happens in 6 months. Which strategy would you implement?"
stocks,"$EAF an entirely overlooked play on steel $EAF, GrafTech International, is one of the largest players in the electric arc furnace (EAF) game. EAFs are used to melt scrap steel, a cheaper alternative to freshly smelted ore made in a blast furnace. 

As steel prices have skyrocketed, big players like $CLF have followed suit and likely have more upside. Between the massive economic growth predicted and infrastructure bill being passed, steel prices will remain elevated. However, $EAF is considerably downstream of the demand. Steel is heavy and  usually not all that expensive, making it a last choice for scrappers in normal times. With a huge lack of supply, scrap prices have gone up considerably. This will increase scrapping volume, and as such drive demand for GrafTechs furnaces. 

Additionally, as countries scramble to curb emissions, more emphasis will be placed on replacing aging blast furnaces with electric arc furnaces that run on electricity in combination with petroleum coke, rather than exclusively coke (which is usally coal coke), making them both more efficient and more environmentally friendly. It also cuts out the need to mine new iron ore, a process that entails it’s own emissions and environmental damage. China has already stated their intent to move away from blast furnaces and increase EAF capacity. As electricity becomes significantly cheaper than coal as the world (and especially China and the US, two huge scrap markets) scales up renewables, EAFs will become increasingly attractive. 

This is a long term play and I encourage you to do your own DD. I believe the company is very fairly valued at a ~8 p/e and 7.23 fwd p/e. Financials are alright but improving, with considerable debt which is being paid off aggressively. The last earnings call noted they are beginning to see increased demand as they come out of a lull from the pandemic. The dividend was cut significantly to a mere .33%, a show of fiscal responsibility that has hurt the share price. 

The EAF market is highly competitive and it will depend on scrap volume to increase significantly in order to get out of the pricing wars the industry is likely engaged in currently. However, EAF produces great ultra high powered furnaces and are also vertically integrated with a petroleum coke producer, making them my pick for the industry even as petroleum coke remains in short supply. 

Analyst PTs range from 14-16 with an average of 15.25, indicating 27% upside from current levels. This stock is beaten down and I’m here for it.

My current position is in Jan 22’ $10c as it provides pretty cheap leverage, however I will likely be adding shares and if you have the capital that is certainly what I would recommend. This will take many years to fully play out. GLTA."

stocks,"The outcome of our current market cycle The market has experienced many important financial events including recessions and bubbles, but when do we know when those events occur and how do we profit from them? According to [fidelity,](https://www.fidelity.com/viewpoints/investing-ideas/sector-investing-business-cycle) there are market cycles that impact different market sectors differently. The different stages cycles are the following; the recession, where the sector loses value after some sort of financial crisis, the early rebound, where the market strongly rebounds after the recession causing a jump in value, the peaking stage, where the sector rises and reaches its peaks, and finally, the moderation cycle, where the sector’s price moderates and consolidation occurs. 

&amp;#x200B;

After understanding the concept of market cycles, we need to find out where we are now in terms of them. It depends on the sector, but let's just look at the Nasdaq and the s&amp;p 500. These help quantify the market trends so we can find out what stage of the cycle we are in.

&amp;#x200B;

Both the s&amp;p 500 and the Nasdaq mirror each other in their graphs so we can assume that they are affected by the same events in the same way. We can also see the previous market cycles that have played out through the years including the financial crisis of 2000’s recession, gains, peak, and moderation followed by the real estate crash in 08-09, leading up to the gains and peaks before the covid crash. If we are considering the covid crash a recession, then we are in the first stage of early rebound and gains with the possibility of peaks being reached. The growth of both the Nasdaq and the S&amp;P 500 are exponentially greater than the gains of the other first-stage rebounds despite the crash sizes being comparable in size. We can also entertain the possibility of the next crash being much bigger than the previous ones. According to Fidelity’s chart of sectors that should do very well during the rebound stage, healthcare, energy, and utility sectors tend to underperform.

&amp;#x200B;

We can see that these sectors mirror each other in the sense that they are underperforming in regards to both the S&amp;P500 and the Nasdaq since the Covid crash. This checks out as it is stated in Fidelity’s chart that these sectors(Energy, Healthcare, and Utilities) tend to underperform post crash. Stock sectors that, according to Fidelity’s chart tend to perform very well post rebound, are in fact doing very well. These sectors include financial, real estate, consumer discretionary, materials, industrial, and information technology.

&amp;#x200B;

Now that we can validate Fidelity’s graph more, we can be more sure of the coming trends. In the event of this current stage being the peak of the market in this cycle, we can use this information to find stocks that perform the best in the following stages. The sectors that perform well during the peak and moderation stages are consumer staples, communication, healthcare, and energy. According to Fidelity, recessions generally negatively affect sectors so it is best to take a defensive position on the sectors that tend to underperform in a recession situation. The stock sectors that underperform during a recession are real estate, information technology, industrials, and communication services. 

Conclusion:

We are at the peak of a stock market cycle after a recession and the stocks that are going to underperform are *x* and the stocks that are going to overperform during the recession are *y*. Regardless of how well a sector could overperform, it is generally a good idea to take a defensive position during a recession."
stocks,"Company valuation. Especially when its private/starting up. I was wondering how are valuations of a company determined for a start up and/or up and coming company?

the reason why i ask is, i like to watch sharktank segments once in a while. 

and obviously these companies are all currently privately owned.

However, whenever they go on the show looking for investments, the company valuation seems to be done in such a linear fashion. The main (and seems like ONLY) valuation method the sharks use is simply investment * equity.

so if someone is asking for a 100k for 10% equity in the company, the sharks simply see it as them saying their company is worth $1MM.

and yes, i get that. its true asking for a 100k for 10% equity is the same thing as saying their company is worth $1MM. but what i DONT get is that it seems like thats the only metric everyone on the show is using. any other argument the person seeking investment uses is denied by the sharks. (i.e. growth potential, current market shares, sales, moat, etc)

Is this correct that that is in fact all that matters for a startup/private company seeking investors?"
stocks,"Getting assigned a stock Well, that happened. I sold a cash put on SOFI earlier in the week, and in premarket on Friday, it was reported that SOFI’s lockout period ends Monday, which means insiders can start selling. Lo and behold, SOFI took a tumble and fell $2 under my put’s strike price, so I’m getting assigned (and if the stock doesn’t move between now and Monday, I’m starting in a -200 hole).

This is my first assignment. I’m curious if this has happened to you before, and if so, what were the results of you holding that stock. Did you sell quickly? Did it become a long term hold?

As for me, I plan to covered-call the @$&amp;% out of my shares until they turn profitable and get called away."
stocks,"Are there any apps that will simply notify me when theres an abundance of good/bad news about a company?

stocks,"$GTT call options thoughts and feedback wanted. I had seen today an Ortex alert stating 3 different short squeeze signals for ticket $GTT. Not knowing anything about the stock and it being slow at my job, I was able to pull some quick stats.

- 44% SI of Float
- 94% CTB Average
- 93.7% Utilization

Based off this data and the possibility for apparent positive earnings news next week, this makes sense as to the signals. 

I've never traded options before (primarily invested in xxx $AMC stock) but I've got some spare change and was considering picking up 4 quick call options at a $8c for 7/16 as the premiums are so low and the possibility of the stock popping, then sell to close for a profit (pure flipping intention) to reinvest if it does in $AMC.

Not looking for financial advice (yes or no)- just feedback and is a smarter person than me could provide possible profit estimates and if it's viable for the low risk.

Thanks in advance!"

I believe someone who buys call options gets the profit from the call writer agreeing to sell at a certain price even if the shares rise.
Is this the same idea with short positions except reversed?

That the put writer agrees to buy the shares at a set price and if the put buyer is right and the stocks tanks then the writer provides the shares at the higher price to the buyer

stocks,"I invest based on quantitative sentiment score on Reddit - I'm beating SPY YTD and BUZZ since inception. Last week's numbers and positions: Hey guys! Posted a little while ago about my project that invests based on sentiment analysis (I know you've seen sentiment trackers abound) and wanted to give an update and some new numbers. Long story short for the week -- you'll $WISH you had $AMC in your portfolio last week, and...eh I got nothing. **IMPORTANT:** Most of the below is a repost of stuff I've posted before (other than the new numbers), but I've added/trimmed down as I get better at explaining the right stuff.

Here's the [source code](https://github.com/tstewart161/Reddit_Sentiment_Trader)! **Note: I include this in case there are algo-traders here, but neither the code nor the algo is the focal point of this post.** Also, this does need to be edited according to your needs (how many of the top you want to invest in, how you want to deploy it, etc.)

I rebalanced my portfolio last week to include the 15 stocks below (equal-weighted), giving me a **2.18% return week over week (net of any fees/slippage), compared to a 0.39% loss for SPY and 0.66% loss for my benchmark, the VanEck BUZZ Social Sentiment ETF**. Important to note that not every week is a breakout win (even if some member stocks in the ETF are), and not every week is a win at all. I've had some weeks where I've trailed both SPY and BUZZ by a lot, but overall I'm beating SPY YTD and BUZZ since its introduction on March 4. This algorithm has returned 52%, compared to SPY's 10% and BUZZ's 7%.

Your typical sentiment analysis stuff coming through. I do this stuff for fun and make money off the stocks I pick doing it most weeks, so thought I'd share. I created an algo that scans the most popular trading sub-reddits and logs the tickers mentioned in due-diligence or discussion-styled posts. In addition to scanning for how many times each ticker was mentioned in a comment, I also logged the popularity of the comment (giving it something similar to an exponential weight -- the more upvotes, the higher on the comment chain and the more people usually see it) and/or post, and finally checked for the sentiment of each comment/self text post.

&amp;#x200B;

**How is sentiment calculated?**

This uses VADER ( Valence Aware Dictionary for Sentiment Reasoning), which is a model used for text sentiment analysis that is sensitive to both polarity (positive/negative) and intensity (strength) of emotion. The way it works is by relying on a dictionary that maps lexical (aka word-based) features to emotion intensities -- these are known as sentiment scores. The overall sentiment score of a comment/post is achieved by summing up the intensity of each word in the text. In some ways, it's easy: words like ‘love’, ‘enjoy’, ‘happy’, ‘like’ all convey a positive sentiment. Also VADER is smart enough to understand the basic context of these words, such as “didn’t really like” as a rather negative statement. It also understands the emphasis of capitalization and punctuation, such as “I LOVED” which is pretty cool. Phrases like “The turkey was great, but I wasn’t a huge fan of the sides” have sentiments in both polarities, which makes this kind of analysis tricky -- essentially with VADER you would analyze which part of the sentiment here is more intense. There’s still room for more fine-tuning here, but make sure to not be doing too much. There’s a similar phenomenon with trying to hard to fit existing data in stats called overfitting, and you don’t want to be doing that.

The best way to use this data is to learn about new tickers that might be trending. This gives many people an opportunity to learn about these stocks and decide if they want to invest in them or not - or develop a strategy investing in these stocks before they go parabolic. **Although the results from this algorithm have beaten benchmarked sentiment indices like BUZZ and FOMO (on a risk-adjusted basis), sentiment analysis is by no means a “long term SPY-beating strategy.”** I’m well aware that most of my crazy returns are from GME and AMC (and more recently, WISH). These tickers do show up in BUZZ, but after they do on Reddit and at a lower weighting.

So, the data from last week:

**Reddit - Highest Sentiment Equities This Week (what’s in my portfolio)**

Estimated Total Comments Parsed Last 7 Day(s): 300k-ish (the text file I store my data in ended up being 55mb -- it’s nothing crazy but it’s quite large for just text)

stocks,"Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning June 28th, 2021 Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning June 28th, 2021.

# **The jobs report will move markets in the week ahead as stocks enter the second half riding high - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/25/the-jobs-report-will-move-markets-in-the-week-ahead-as-stocks-enter-the-second-half-riding-high.html)**
*****
&gt; The monthly jobs report is the highlight in the coming week, as June winds down and markets start the second half of the year.
*****
&gt; Economists are expecting about 700,000 jobs. That’s better than the 559,000 in May but below the forecasts of several months ago that payroll creation would be rolling along with monthly gains of at least 1 million.
*****
&gt; The report is a key read on the labor market, which has replaced lost jobs more slowly than expected as companies complain about worker shortages and difficulty finding help. But it is also being watched as a gauge on how sticky the current jump in inflation might be. Rising wages are one thing to watch but also worker scarcity, since that can make goods and services more expensive.
*****
&gt; Stocks have turned in a mixed performance for the month of June so far. The S&amp;P 500 was up 1.8% as of Friday for the month, and up 7.7% in the second quarter for a 15.6% year-to-date gain. The Nasdaq was up 4.4% in June and up 8.4% for the quarter. The Dow, meanwhile, lagged in June with a modest 0.3% decline, but it is up 4.4% quarter-to-date.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500, ending Friday at 4,280, has already edged slightly above 4,276 — the average year end forecast of Wall Street strategists surveyed by CNBC.
*****
&gt; For the most part, strategists expect the market to continue its upward trajectory into the second half, although at a slower pace. Some have also said the second half could bring a pause in the rally before the market ends the year higher.
*****
&gt; “I think it’s been very good for the stock market that long rates have stopped going up in the first quarter and are going down, taking the pressure off,” The Leuthold Group chief investment strategist Jim Paulsen said.
*****
&gt; “Meanwhile earnings have continued to climb unabated, and if you think about it the vast majority of stocks didn’t go anywhere in the second quarter,” Paulsen said. “What we’ve got is a cheaper market than we had in March and we had one where rates are lower and we’re still getting unrestricted policy help from both monetary and fiscal authorities.”
*****
&gt; Paulsen said he thinks the S&amp;P 500 could hit 4,500 before pulling back later in the year to finish at about 4,100.
*****
&gt; “My attitude now is it’s a very hard tape to fight, and it takes a lot of fortitude to do so, but you’re at a point where it’s a lot cheaper to hedge than it has been,” Interactive Brokers chief strategist Steve Sosnick said. “It’s a lot cheaper to hedge and a more opportune time to do so. It’s always cheaper to buy an umbrella when there are no rain clouds on the horizon.”
*****
&gt; Stocks were higher in the past week, despite the turbulence the week earlier after the June Federal Reserve meeting. The Fed laid the groundwork for its ultimate step away from easy policies, with Fed Chairman Jerome Powell saying Fed officials were considering tapering their purchases of mortgages and Treasury securities.
*****
&gt; “There seems to be a greater complacency,” Sosnick said, noting the market reaction to the Fed’s potential unwind of easy policy was calm.
*****
&gt; If the Fed announces it will taper its bond purchases in the next several months, it would be expected to wait several months more before it starts the process. Then it could take many more months to take the $120 billion in monthly purchases to zero. The unwind of that policy is especially important since it could be a precursor to the Fed raising interest rates.
*****
&gt; “Underlying everything, there’s a huge faith in the Fed, that they will do the right thing, and they’ll continue to do the right thing,” Sosnick said.
*****
&gt; Sosnick said he’s watching the bond market going into quarter end this week, after the surge in yields last quarter end. The relatively tame behavior of bond yields, which move opposite price, has been a hallmark of the last part of the second quarter.
*****
&gt; The benchmark 10-year Treasury was yielding 1.52% Friday, up from 1.45% a week prior.
*****
&gt; Sosnick said if the 10-year yield does remains contained, that should be good for tech. “Right now, it appears there’s that kind of relationship between the 10-year and NDX. If 10-year yields are lower, people are using it as a buy signal for the Nasdaq 100. Is that fool proof? Far from it, but people are using it,” he said.
*****
&gt; Tech stocks were up 2.4% for the week and 9.4% for the quarter so far, after being out of favor when yields were moving higher in March.
*****
&gt; “The advice at the end of the first quarter was that [10-year] rates were going to 2%. Rather than going up, rates went down and as a result growth beat value and techs beat financials,” The Leuthold Group’s Paulsen said. “Now everyone thinks rates are going to stay low longer. I think value, cyclicals and small caps are going to win this quarter. I think we’re going to have a correction and end the year around 4,100.”
*****
&gt; # Jobs, jobs, jobs
&gt; The payroll number Friday morning is by far the biggest economic event of the week.
*****
&gt; “We expect next week’s June employment report to show that nonfarm payrolls expanded by 800k, pushing the unemployment rate down to 5.5% from 5.8%. Strong demand and weak supply should continue to put upward pressure on wages,” wrote Bank of America economists.
*****
&gt; According to Dow Jones, economists expect 683,000 payrolls were created in June and the unemployment rate fell to 5.7% from 5.8%. But the market is also looking to see if the data reveals anything new about inflation and whether it could be transitory, or temporary, as the Fed has stated.
*****
&gt; “The problem is because the markets have tended to surprise us, it’s tough to figure out what the trade is,” said Sosnick. “There’s two components of it. It is the unemployment rate, or the labor force participation, the stuff Powell is really looking for.”
*****
&gt; Wage data could be hot with the Dow Jones estimate at a 3.7% year-over-year gain in average hourly wages, up from 1.98% in May.
*****
&gt; “Are we approaching full employment? With non non-transitory inflationary affects?” Sosnick said. “You’re seeing companies giving signing bonuses. Those are transitory but if you have to raise wages and if wages are going to go up, that is non transitory.”
*****
&gt; Besides the jobs data, there is ISM manufacturing data and monthly vehicle sales Thursday.
*****
&gt; OPEC also meets on July 1, and market pros are watching to see if the OPEC and its alliance in OPEC plus will continue to add oil to the market.

&gt; # July has been Top Month of Post-Election Years

&gt; July historically is the best performing month of the third quarter however, the mostly negative results in August and September tend to make the comparison easy. Two “hot” Julys in 2009 and 2010 where DJIA and S&amp;P 500 both gained greater than 6% and strong performances in 2013 and 2018 have boosted July’s average gains since 1950 to 1.3% and 1.1% respectively. Such strength inevitability stirs talk of a “summer rally”, but beware the hype, as it has historically been the weakest rally of all seasons (page 74, Stock Trader’s Almanac 2021).

&gt; July begins NASDAQ’s worst four months and is the fifth weakest performing NASDAQ month since 1971, posting a 0.6% average gain. Dynamic trading often accompanies the first full month of summer as the beginning of the second half of the year brings an inflow of new capital. This creates a bullish beginning, a soft week after options expiration and some strength towards the end.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/24425b5573f14df7e7f5039ac0dd34f4/01813a8e14a72b86-9a/s400x600/8951bac1faa8d0887549c23fc161e859a01787fd.jpg))**

&gt; Post-election year Julys rank at or near the top of all post-election year months. DJIA, S&amp;P 500, and NASDAQ are ranked #1. Russell 2000 ranks #2. Delving deeper into this data revealed that many of these past “hot” Julys were preceded by a flat or down first half of the year so there is no guarantee that this July will live up to its historical post-election year record again this year.

&gt; # Bears in Hibernation

&gt; The S&amp;P 500's dip below its 50-DMA and the corresponding rally to new all-time highs did little to dramatically change investor sentiment. This week's survey results from the AAII saw bullish sentiment fall slightly from 41.1% last week to 40.4%. That is once again within the past several weeks' range at the lowest level since only two weeks ago.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/06/062421-AAII-Bull.png))**

&gt; Bearish sentiment was also lower this week, falling by 2.9 percentage points to 23.3%. As with bullish sentiment, that is the lowest level in two weeks. From a longer-term perspective, bearish sentiment is more than 7 percentage points below its historical average of 30.5%. In other words, while sentiment is not exuberant, it continues to skew optimistic.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/06/062421-AAII-Bear.png))**

&gt; The historically muted level of bearish sentiment also shows up in the Investors Intelligence survey of newsletter writers. This week, that reading fell half of one percentage point to 15.8%. That is the lowest percentage of respondents reporting as bearish since March 14th, 2018. Over the past 30 years, there have been only a handful of other periods with lower levels of market pessimism.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/06/062421-II-Bear-2.png))**

&gt; Pivoting back to the AAII survey, with bearish sentiment historically muted, a larger share of investors are reporting as neutral. 36.6% of respondents reported as such this week, up 3.9 percentage points from the six-week low last week.

&gt; # Manufacturing Activity Indices at Historic Levels

&gt; As recent economic data shows, the robust post-COVID recovery has brought about a historic rebound in U.S. manufacturing activity. Pent-up demand and low inventories of capital goods have caused companies to fire up their machines at record levels, and manufacturing supply management professionals have responded with relative delight in recent surveys. Both the IHS Markit and Institute for Supply Management (ISM) Manufacturing Indices have been robust across the board, as new order growth, hiring plans, and the backlog of orders point to better health in the sector. The downside…higher prices, as purchasing managers’ queried in the survey pinpointed high levels of input cost inflation brought about by a broad-based spike in raw materials prices. The latest survey results show the June IHS Markit U.S. Manufacturing PMI at a new all-time high of 62.6, which compares to the Bloomberg consensus estimate of 61.5 and May’s reading of 62.1.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/6.24.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1)**

&gt; “The demand for goods and the rebound in manufacturing activity have been remarkable as folks seem determined to get on with their lives. We know that U.S. consumers like to spend, and it seems like they are more than willing to make up for lost time.” explained LPL Financial Director of Research Marc Zabicki.

&gt; We believe the latest IHS Markit manufacturing readout may foretell a good result for the ISM benchmark’s expected release on July 1. That index series has also been near record levels, although just below its all-time high. The long-term ISM chart paints a fairly good picture of past peaks and troughs and the roller-coaster of activity that can occur in the manufacturing sector. In fact, the recent highs in the two manufacturing indicators we have mentioned have us looking ahead to an eventual deceleration in activity, which could come later this year. This deceleration could be brought about by the ultimate slowing of demand for some of the hottest items of late: automobiles, appliances, and technology devices. This doesn’t mean we are souring on the prospect for economic growth in the U.S….only that peak activity, as we are witnessing now, which is usually followed by an eventual slowdown in demand. We should see some of this become visible via U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) growth that is expected to advance at a slower pace in late 2021 and early 2022.

stocks,What apps or websites do you use for watchlists? I generally use Yahoo Finance but I would really like a spot to take notes on the tickers I have saved. I feel like an area with notes would be super helpful for general info I've read about the company or important dates coming up I want to watch for.
stocks,"Is MITK Stock a solid investment? I recently bought a decent amount of MITK on the recommendation of my friend who works in finance.  He explained it to me as a company that creates the technology for mobile check deposits and opening up a bank account through a mobile.  I thought this was a intresting company to invest in so I did.  I'm new to stocks so I would like to know what the community thinks of this stock, since I don't know key factors to look for.

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Friday, June 25, 2021 **PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, June 25, 2021**

***Please note:*** *I've seen a lot of questions surrounding the analyst price target upgrades that I post, so I just wanted to clear some things up and explain my reasoning behind including them.*

*I frequently get asked if I think analyst price target predictions are ""accurate"" or if I expect a stock I mention to hit the price predicted.* ***The answer to both these questions is NO.*** 

*I really don't put much, if any importance, on the actual numbers predicted by an analyst. They are just a meter to gauge how bullish or bearish they are. My purpose in including price target upgrades is to find trends in analyst thinking. In other words, if I see a bunch of different, well-known analysts all giving bullish target increases on a stock, I'll start doing research on a stock to see why they are so bullish. I have found quite a few profitable trades in this manner.*

***In short, the purpose of the price target upgrades is idea generation. Keep an eye out if you start seeing the same stock receiving bullish target increases by different analysts.***

Stocks were mixed, but mostly positive today, with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) recording a fresh intraday high and the Dow Jones (DIA) nicely continuing its recovery after falling last week, driven higher by a boost in bank stocks across the board after the Fed removed all pandemic-era restrictions on capital distributions. The Nasdaq (QQQ) fell modestly after several days of reaching new all-time highs. The core personal consumption expenditures, which serves as the Fed’s preferred gauge for inflation was released but did not adversely affect the market, another signal the market is prepared to stomach higher than usual inflationary readings as the economy continues to recover. 

The core PCE index measures the changes in prices paid by consumers for goods and services, minus volatile food and energy prices, which are staples and therefore not considered in the equation. The report registered a 3.4% year-on-year increase for May, in-line with Wall Street estimates and marking the fastest jump since 1992. However, it is important to note that the report is still reflecting “base effects” as prices rebound from the pandemic-induced collapse last year. 

Yesterday, the Federal Reserve released the results of its “stress test” on US banks, an annual test instituted after the 2008 financial crisis meant to determine the financial health of lenders during an extreme hypothetical financial crisis (not unlike what was experienced last year).The test used a hypothetical “severely adverse” scenario where the U.S. economy saw GDP shrink by 4%, the unemployment rate rise to 10.75%, and the stock market contract by 55%. In the end, the test showed the 23 largest banks could withstand $474 billion in losses from loans and other positions and still emerge with more than double the minimum required capital.

The results of this stress test are extremely important because last year, during the height of the pandemic, the Fed imposed restrictions on banks on capital distributions like dividends and buybacks in order to ensure banks would have enough capital to weather the storm. Given the clean bill of health, these restrictions have now been fully lifted, paving the way for banks across the board to raise dividends and ramp up stock buyback programs. To put in extent how much money this is, the six largest banks in the US - Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup, Goldman Sachs (GS), JP Morgan (JPM), Morgan Stanley (MS) and Wells Fargo (WFC) - are expected to increase payouts by $66 billion to $130 billion over the next four quarters.

In other news, President Joe Biden announced he had reached an infrastructure agreement with a bipartisan group of senators, which catalyzed a jump in industrial stocks that had been lagging the last few weeks. The deal, which would cost $1.2 trillion over the next five years, commits  $312 billion toward traditional infrastructure priorities such as roads, bridges, public transit, airports and waterways. The bulk of the remainder will be invested in water, broadband and power grid restoration, according to a fact sheet provided by the White House. 

Gabriela Santos, global market strategist at JP Morgan said, “The way we're thinking about it is, it has the positive side of the deal in terms of the equity market perspective: More spending on physical infrastructure, electric vehicles, 5G and broadband, without the tax increases which would have been a negative from the equity market perspective. This is certainly a positive especially for the more domestic, cyclical-heavy parts of the market, as well as parts of technology like semiconductors, which are more related to the 5G and the green theme."" 

**Highlights**

* Yesterday, ARK Investment Manager Cathie Wood and Twitter and Square (SQ) CEO Jack Dorsey have been named as co-hosts of “The ₿ Word,” a new initiative designed to bring business and technology leaders together to discuss how institutions can use digital currencies. Today, through Twitter (TWTR) Jack directly asked Elon to speak at the conference, which he accepted. Will be interesting to see what happens. 
* Panasonic, Tesla’s (TSLA) leading battery supplier, announced it has sold its entire stake in TSLA stock for roughly $3.6 billion. There is no word as to why they did this but Panasonic assured the move would not affect its supply of batteries. Years ago, Panasonic made a $1.6 billion bet on building a joint battery factory with Tesla in Nevada called the Gigafactory. It caused years of losses at Panasonic before the company said this year it was finally turning a quarterly profit.
* Chinese ride-hailing giant Didi is seeking to IPO in the US, according to the company’s latest regulatory filing. 
* Starbucks CEO denied a Wall Street Journal report that the company was running low in supplies of cups and coffee. CEO Kevin Johnson told Jim Cramer, “there is no shortage of cups, no shortage of coffee”.

stocks,"JO Coffee ETF (ETN) Question Hello. I recently came across this one coffee ETF (or ETN (?)). I wanted to invest in it but I honestly didn't find any information on it. And what I did find, it was very broad and I still remain not knowing what it really is or how it works. I'd say I'm a beginner when it comes to investments but I'm wondering if I could get some help or direction about where to find more information on this JO ETF."
stocks,"Got 3k to put into a ‘safe’ stock for a couple months. Ideally looking for a gain but if flat, no problem. I have 3k sitting around which was initially saved for a product that’s coming out at the end of this year, but I feel like there are some moves to be made before that with certain stocks - e.g AMZN, AAPL, AMD. 

I was strongly considering putting this money into Amazon. If it goes down, fine. I got no problem holding for years. If it goes up, I anticipate a jump which can make a decent couple hundred profit. From a valuation standpoint, looks historically fair or undervalued. Would also be nice to flex my one share of Amazon :). Does this seem like a decent place to park some cash?"
stocks,"Attracting investors to oil and gas company Hi, I'm doing a project for my online marketing class. I was assigned a small-cap oil and gas company as my ""client"" and my goal is to attract investors to purchase their (growing) stock. Besides social media (Google ads, twitter, facebook, linkedin ads), what other digital marketing strategies do you all think would be helpful?

Also, how would one go about using digital marketing to attract institutional investors?

Just looking for some ideas...in a day and age when oil companies are not being seen in the best of light...thanks in advance."

stocks,"Should I sell my options before close or hold over the weekend? Second time trading options I have SPY 426 calls for June 30th which are ITM now, I watched a video the other night and the guy said always sell your contracts at close bc you can’t control what happens in after hours and the weekend. Should I sell and take my profit now and then buy it back Monday open? Can I do that? Or should I just hold them until the 30th?"
stocks,"""A rising tide lifts all ships,"" but a submarine may not know the difference. What are your holdings that didn't budge this past year? Overall I think we can agree the market had been way up but I was looking at my portfolio and saw some that sank during this time. The main one that comes to mind is my tiny holding of $ESRT. As you can expect, tourism to the Empire State Building was decimated last year and as such, the dividend died and the price sank. However I'm still holding because:

1. It's now part of my tourism and vacation recovery play.

2. I like the idea of having an ""ownership"" interest in the Empire State Building.

What about you? Which of your holdings held still or sank during this bull market? Are you still holding and if so, why?"

stocks,"DD: Electric Vehicles &gt; Batteries &gt; Graphite : simple form Note: More full length DD's can be found in my post history but I figure short form is helpful since people read a lot of DD's.

\----------------------

Graphite - 200 lbs of it on average per single consumer electric vehicle.

World lacks necessary supply to fund EV growth battery demands.

Several stocks are coming out to fuel this industry.

Two forms are mined then processed, or synthetic processed from petroleum byproducts.

Threats include solid state batteries.

Currently CATL, LG, Samsung, Tesla source their graphite from small, scattered producers across the globe.

Biden wants U.S. EV dominance, U.S. wants secure supply chains for rare earth metals and graphite.

Tesla wants clean graphite sourced from the North American continent.

There is a single U.S. graphite producer($WWR).  Several small graphite mining start ups coming up in the OTC's(Syraah, Sir Mick Davis company), and a single Canadian graphite producer($NMG).

Graphite demands will increase 100x with EV battery production demands, industry will need to be stood up quickly and produce large volumes of product.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: By the way personal opinion stay away from the graphite mining stocks and go with the graphite PRODUCING stocks (Factories) they can produce battery grade graphite from natural mined graphite or petroleum byproducts and it's the more profitable and stable of the side, the company you pick should at least be producing even if it mines also, there are several."
stocks,"TD's list of 'Strong Buy' stocks have bad annual records... This might be a really dumb question but.. I'm looking through a list of stocks on TD Ameritrade considered ""Strong Buys"" and I have them sorted by current price of Sub-$5. 
The first 10 I look at have really bad looking price records for the past 2 years. A few have been on downward trends for months.

Are those classified as such because of maybe company announcements that might change things for the better?"
stocks,"Any idea why Fibrogen (NASDAQ: FGEN) tanked 10% today from premarket after receiving a positive recommendation on it's key drug? https://www.barrons.com/articles/fibrogen-stock-key-drug-europe-approval-51624631335

""European regulators issued a positive recommendation on FibroGen ‘s key drug roxadustat, which has had major setbacks in its path to approval in the U.S.

The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, part of the European Medicines Agency, recommended granting marketing authorization in the European Union for roxadustat as a treatment for anemia symptoms in chronic kidney disease patients.

The decision, announced on Friday, and made Thursday by the committee, amounts to a seal of approval for the drug, though marketing authorization must be granted by the European Commission.""

This is positive news that led to a 5.47% increase in price pre-market. Since then, it's tanked down to 27.65 which is a decrease of 5% on the day so far.

How does this work? This is objectively positive news, what would cause a 10% decrease in price without an abnormally large volume? 

Average Volume: 967.44k
Volume: 841.40k

I'd understand 'selling the news' but the volume on market open was only 44.35k.

Leading up to today FGEN had a 34% increase this this past month, is this shares being sold to cash out?"
stocks,"If I invest in a stock at different times in a year, do they get taxed on individual purchases? If I was to buy 100 shares of a stock, then 364 days later bought 100 more shares of the same stock, then sold them all on day 366, would they de taxed differently? Would the first hundred be taxed as owning them over a year, and the second under? Or would they all be taxed at the same rate?"

Videos or reading both work. Thanks"
stocks,"Is it safe to say my first foray into “meme” stocks has failed yet? Long story short as of yesterday I was the highest over my initial investment amount I’ve ever been LTD (only slightly under that currently), and this is despite having bought into BB at $15. 

For the most part I am trying to keep a decent long term portfolio with a “second savings account with better interest potential” kind of mindset, AMD and DIS leading the way for me. Still learning but feel like I’m getting more confident each day. 

The only reason I got into BB is because I was reluctant to jump on board the GME and AMC ships and after seeing how those eventually turned out I let a sense of FOMO take over and figured BB was next on the list to see the same treatment. It may have already on a smaller scale, but for when I chose to buy in it doesn’t seem too hopeful. I purposely didn’t go too crazy so I didn’t stand to lose much, but seeing as how it spent pretty much all of June falling gradually from my initial buy in, is it safe to say I should abandon this journey now and reinvest that money into something else?

Any advice appreciated, sorry if this is low level stuff. As I said, still learning."
stocks,"What are your picks for the next group of stocks to be added to the S&amp;P500 index? I have two:

The first is Match Group. MTCH.

Owner of Tinder/Hinge/Match/OkCupid etc. Household name. Almost every single person I know uses it. Four straight quarters of positive GAAP earnings, over 500M TTM net income, 850M cash on hand, 2.5B TTM revenue, on a market cap of 44B. Around 750M in trailing free cash flow and growing. Only negative I see is that they're highly leveraged after their spin-off from IAC, with 3.8B in long term debt.

Second should be **slam dunk** and that's Zoom. Ticker ZM.

Household name. Used by every single person I know. Every single company in the Russell 2000 (probably except Microsoft and Cisco) uses it and spends a lot of money on it contractually. 872M TTM net income, 4.60 BILLION cash on hand, zero debt, 1.58B in TTM free cash flow and growing. P/E of 127, which is less than the P/E of similar SaaS S&amp;P component Paycom (PAYC), which has a P/E of 148. Market cap of 108B, which, if today they entered the index, would slot it right between CVS and ServiceNow in market cap. By the way, SaaS peer NOW has a P/E of 724.

stocks,"How Burry predicted 2007, self-repost from Burryology I have been reading the book: The oil factor by Stephen Leeb written in 2004. He talks about the inverse relation between (rapid) increase in oil prices, lowering supply and high demand, but he takes a detour. The dotcom bubble dropped sp500 -40%, nasdaq -80%, 16trillion USD wealth went to 7 trillion. The fed lowered rates to 0.75%, boosted borrowing and home prices served as a healthy collateral, which can only go up right? US was highly in debt before the bust, but after… oh with low rates causing booms in home prices, more debt. In this 2004 books he says, if home prices would fall it would be taking down the banking system (1:6 leverage at that time so 18% default was needed to make the banks insolvent, we know later the leverage was 1:20 so 5% default was enough). What would cause home prices to fall? Policies to curb inflation, aaaand when did the fed start to raise rates? Yes, early 2007. No more cheap refinancing causing defaults (subprime etc), and booooom.

Amazing book btw on oil, I would recommend it :) thought I would share my joy of finding this out, maybe Burry read this book also in 2004?"

stocks,Always remember hindsight is 20-20. You may be sitting there upset at yourself that you didn’t hold onto a position long enough to reap the insane gains its now pulling in. Or maybe you didn’t even buy into that position because you were unsure of its future performance and now it’s off to the moon while you sit on the sidelines and watch. It’s easy to say to yourself that you should have bought and held when you see it taking off now. But you must remember why you didn’t initially buy and always take that into consideration. Greed will eventually be your downfall in the stock market.

stocks,"Approval for ""level 3"" on etrade? Apologies if this has been asked here before, couldn't find it in the search.

Recently had the realization that I was a fool for buying as many naked calls as I always have and that spreads would have saved me a lot of pain over the years. Apparently I needed approval for them though on etrade, which I applied for earlier this week and got rejected for, without a reason being given. Surprising to me because spreads actually seem less risky than naked calls/puts, so not sure why it's off limits.

Listed that I'd been trading for 5+ years, shares and options (no bonds), income neither highest nor lowest bracket. My account size is pretty tiny (4 digits), not sure if that's a factor.

stocks,"What happens to the stock market if labor participation keeps dropping? Not sure if there has been discussion?  I didn't see a search function.  If there is one I will do that.

I am trying to make sense of everything going on. There are lots of things I do not understand like Hawkish vs Dovish.  I believe the debate right now is do the Feds raise the rates to slow down inflation or do they leave them low to support the labor market?

If we look at labor restraints for manufacturing, shipping, etc I think the general assumption on Wall Street is that we are getting back to full participation at some point.  We are just having a difficult time figuring out how long that will take.

If for instance the Junes job report shows job losses, what is the impact on the market?  What if we have a continual drain on the labor force of let's say, 100k people exiting the workforce every month?  Would that catch up to a company like American Airlines and force them into Chapter 11?

stocks,"What do you guys think about coursera? I am really amazed by the platform, I went to great universities (2) and I would not recommend to just do not go to college and do online courses but mainly because uni is more about network and signaling than knowledge, but for some people that live in countries where education is scarce or unafordable it could be a substitute (+now with covid I think online school is more valued than before). And for people that do have acces to college (my case) I think is a really good complement tool to show in your CV that you reinforced some skills or just learned new ones. 

That said I went full Lynch and went to see if it is a public company, and it is. And with a really good balance sheet. The main problems that I see and this is why ask for advise from fellow strangers is: Coursera has losses (it doesn't really bother me, it is a growing company) and my main concern: a price/sales ratio of 20. This is a lot of growth discounted there, for reference is a similar multiple than tesla but without earnings.

stocks,"PTRA: Perhaps the Most Direct Beneficiary from the Infra Deal  [Proterra](https://www.proterra.com/) \- $PTRA - you know know them, the electric bus company.

For the Investors:

* [The bipartisan infrastructure bill's framework](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/06/24/fact-sheet-president-biden-announces-support-for-the-bipartisan-infrastructure-framework/) agreed upon in Washington yesterday explicitly sets aside $7.5b for Electric busses (scroll 2/3 way down to see the allocation table).

   * Biden recently took a video conference tour of the factory. I won't link it here because auto-mod kills posts with links to certain video websites to protect against grifters. Easy to find with a simple search though. 
* As crowded as the EV space is, there just isn't solid US-based competition keeping them from seizing the moment. [This article](https://www.greenbiz.com/article/5-electric-bus-makers-shifting-next-gear) does well to show the competition, which is all EU/CN-based. Over and over, the Sec of Energy and President himself have stressed they want US-based companies to reap the fiscal initiatives. They are a E-bus company, not passenger vehicles. They're not wasting capital trying to edge out TSLA, F, GM, VW, etc. They know their niche, they are the main player in it, and it's about to get big fiscal tailwinds for this.
   * Municipalities aren't just buying this to show how ""green"" they are. EV busses promise to dramatically reduce preventative and corrective maintenance over the lifetime. If the Feds are fiscally rewarding you for making this switch, why wouldn't they go this route over renewing ICE busses 100% on their own dime?
* The odd pump-and-dump you see from a few months ago was when it was a S\*AC at the height of those pump-and-dumps, and it entered into an agreement with Proterra (it's no longer a S\*AC). The wheat is separating from the chaff among those companies now.

stocks,"$SKYT - Skywater Technology - American semiconductor foundries with short and medium term catalysts upcoming for starters: this is only the second time I've done a DD like this, and I welcome criticism if you have any. I'm not a financial advisor, I'm like many of you, a redditor who got too interested in the markets while I've been working from home. 

Allow me to introduce you to an American semiconductor play that's poised to do very well in the short and medium terms. Skywater Technology is a Minnesota-based foundry that helps companies develop prototypes for highly specialized semiconductors. They're currently opening a second facility in Florida to expand production and capabilities. They also build radiation-resistant semiconductors for the Department of Defense, aerospace, and automotive sectors. While it was established in the early 90s, it only IPO'd a few months ago, so this is a stable, solid company with an established client based that's poised to grow as semiconductor demand increases.

I'm not going to get into balance sheets or earnings reports or anything like that, because they mostly don't matter for the catalysts I'm talking about, and we only have two from this year since they IPO'd. If you want earnings or income or whatever, look elsewhere: they're still negative. That looks to change as their second facility comes online in Florida, but like I said, it doesn't matter for most of the information below.

The stock has increased significantly since it IPO'd near $14. It's currently sitting closer to $30. It has a number of very short term and medium term catalysts that will propel the stock to new highs, but first let me explain:

* One of the reasons it has had such an increase in price is because it has a very low float, about 7.5 million shares, and most of its investors know that there's nothing but up for this company, so they never sell. (The short-term catalyst is based on this knowledge.) 
* Another note is that this is not a short squeeze, because nobody shorts this company because it's absolutely suicide. The stock only goes up. It's %short is less than 2% of float.

#Short-term: Russel 3000 today.

[The Russell has announced that $SKYT will be included in the Russell 3000 later today.](https://www.skywatertechnology.com/press-releases/skywater-technology-set-to-join-russell-3000-index/) This is the first time this stock has been indexed, and as such the index will be forced to buy shares. With a low float and a small shareholder base comprised of buy-and-hold investors, this volume will cause a spike in the price. 

#Medium-term: Semiconductor funding

The US federal government has been working on a bill to secure American semiconductor manufacturing. Skywater is wholly based in the US, with a foundry in Minnesota and another about to open up in Florida. It's a key provider for radiation-resistant chips for the Department of Defense, and might be the only company able to fulfill some of those contracts. At a market cap of 1.2 billion, it's very likely to receive the most money from this bill by market cap of any company. [Shortly before the Senate agreed on their version of the bill, the senator from Minnesota, Amy Klobuchar, as well as their US Representative Dean Phillips toured the plant.](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210602005861/en/SkyWater-Hosts-Senator-Amy-Klobuchar-and-Representative-Dean-Phillips) This company is on Congress's radar. They're getting a nice piece of the pie.

#Another catalyst of questionable term

Another factor is that Skywater does not trade options. This is likely due to the relatively low volume of the stock. The above catalysts could propel the volume high enough for options trading. If options start being traded, volume will further increase. Volume is $SKYT best friend, and if you're a $SKYT investor, it's your best friend too.

positions: 531 shares with an average cost basis around $27. Will add today if it drops below $30 again but I don't think it will."

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

I went with amd because (simplified explanation) the much lower price felt there was more chance at a greater gain.

With Nvidia I wasn't sure if i'd make a large gain as quickly and the amount of stock in comparison to amd I could comfortably buy.

stocks,"What is the point of stocks so I'm a young guy with no investment experience and I'm trying to wrap my head around stocks.

At first I thought that you would buy a stock because you want to 'invest' in the company and because of the investment, the company will get money and use it to grow.    
This is kind of half right.  Its only really true for the IPO.  When the company sells ownership to the public.  But IPO only happens once, and for like Amazon their IPO was well before the stock started doing anything.    
So, Amazon sells ownership to the public, they get a bunch of money to invest in their operations and grow the business.  And investors own part of the company.  Then investors can trade these stocks.  
But about 10 years after the IPO, the stock price starts going up, and up, and up.  And this money doesn't go to Amazon.  When you buy the stock, you're buying from another investor who wants to sell.  Could also be the company too but not always.  So the reason you would buy is because you think the price is going to go up and you can sell it later for more money.  


So the stock is worth whatever someone is willing to pay for it.  It just seems a bit weird to me how the money travels.   Stocks with dividends make the most sense of how to determine its worth because there is quantifiable worth there.  But I was also reading that most stocks are not dividends stocks and typically you can make more money on non-dividend stocks.

stocks,"What are the best ways a company with tons of cash can raise shareholder value? Ideas I am about to contact Investor relations, HMPT LDI Good evening everyone. This post is specific to these 2 companies as I am about to contact investor relations but I figured as nearly 3 million are members someone may share other ideas.

So just a tiny bit of background. I also wrote a post on HMPT and LDI a few weeks ago, however it hasnt done anything to these stocks... These are both mortgage companies that are cash cows, but were crushed 2nd week of May right after RKT missed earnings. RKT is the market leader. Before RKT report HMPT was under 1% short and LDI was maybe 7-8%... I say this because I believe the whole sector was attacked immediately after a small miss on RKT. RKT was always heavily shorted since its IPO..... The only thing is RKT and UWMC have recovered HMPT and LDI have not!

LDI has given a 200 million special dividend 62 cents a share and declared a regular 8 cent dividend a quarter..... I guess those dont matter as its near an all time low?

HMPT hasnt done anything just yet but they made 150 million last quarter alone!! Are set to make 300 million this year, and the company is 900 million market cap and heavy short. LDI is under 4 billion and set to make nearly 1 billion. they both have amazing cash flows and enough to pay all bills... and do a serious share buyback....

My question is, should they do another special dividend? a buyback? go private? Pay people on social media to garner interest on the stocks?

I am ready to make a pitch to investor relations. I figured a pitch with a brainstorm of ideas would be better! 

Thoughts please share"
stocks,"Intraday Margin calculation: Merrill Okay I went and got the answer about intraday margin from Merrill (YMMV with others but I imagine it is similar), so I'm sharing.

Margin is indeed charged monthly, and tabulated daily, to determine a monthly average.

The components of that average are **your margin balance each day at the close of after-hours**, i.e. 8PM EST.

This means that if you open margin in PM, and close it in the AH, **you are charged nothing**.

Weekends are indeed charged as two extra days."

This ninth film in the *Fast &amp; Furious* franchise was originally slated to open over Memorial Day weekend in 2020 until COVID-19 muffled those plans.

stocks,"Benchmarking Big Tech: Should Amazon be the Highest Valued Company? 5-Year Revenue CAGR:
AMZN: 29.9%
GOOG: 18.8%
MSFT: 13.0%
AAPL: 7.4%

5-Year EBITDA CAGR:
AMZN: 44.5%
MSFT: 21.0%
GOOG: 19.8%
AAPL: 4.9%

5-Year Net Income CAGR:
AMZN: 87.3%
MSFT: 39.8%
GOOG: 24.7%
AAPL: 8.5%

And no, this is not skewed by an outlier 2020 for AMZN - it has continually outpaced YoY on each metric, with no indication of slowing down as marketplace continues to benefit from e-commerce adoption and international expansion, and its highly profitable non-marketplace segments continue their hyper growth trajectories.

Amazon is nearing $500b in annual revenue and is still significantly outpacing the other big tech companies in growing the top line, and it’s blowing them out of the water on growing the bottom line. All while dumping almost $100b into R&amp;D and capex and hiring half a million people in the last year.

What other company can boast a business model as expansive, yet still innovative and high growth as Amazon? It has an increasingly diversified and cohesive platform, and all of its segments are category leaders (e-commerce, AWS, gaming/video streaming) or emerging major players (logistics, ads, pharmacy, grocery) in massive addressable markets. Most important, it’s not afraid expand into completely new markets, unlike its mega-cap counterparts.

In my opinion, it’s only a matter of time until Amazon is the highest market cap of the bunch, and frankly I’m not sure how it isn’t already (antitrust be damned - I’ll gladly dump 100% of my portfolio into AWS in any breakup, as if that will ever happen).

stocks,"Work from home index? Some companies seem to be more reluctant than others to keep work from home going in a post covid world.  Lots of workers, including myself, view work from home as a perk and would prioritize a company that offered it over one that didn't.

Looking solely at it's chart history(ewww I know), it has had several times where after a rapid drop of about 25-30%, it proceeded to bounce back 30-40%. I've been wondering when the next bounce back might be, if there is one at all, and it might be next week. Again this is just from looking at charts.

It may not bounce for a few reasons. IPO lockup ended, shares have diluted and they are projecting much less revenue next year than they are this year, all of which seem to be baked into it's somewhat cheap price right now(close to an ATL). I don't think ABCL is undervalued, or overvalued for that matter. I'm just looking for some feedback as to whether or not tomorrow might be a good time to buy and have a potential major rally next week of up to 40-50%. Thoughts?"

stocks,"Pandemic related market trends Heyp /r/stocks

The purpose of this post is to create discussion about which plays to make based on current and predicted market trends.  
Obviously right now the world is coming out of the COVID-19 pandemic thanks to vaccination.  This is currently the trend I'd like to focus on.  


A good example to start with is the cruising industry.  Royal Caribbean for example was at a pre-pandemic all time high of $133 per share, meanwhile it dropped to as low as $23 per share during the pandemic and has since recovered to $87 per share - still well below its pre-pandemic level.  Cruise lines have recently been reopening.  Some are facing further delays.  But it appears to me that a stock like Royal Caribbean could be a potential investment.  The market will stabilize eventually and its possible RC or Carnival are currently undervalued.  

  
I'd like to hear from other users as to which markets they think were most affected by the pandemic and which will have high potential for recovery/growth as the economy begins to normalize."
stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Thursday, June 24, 2021 **PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, June 24, 2021**

The market edged higher once again, with both the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ) driven higher by an incredible rally in technology stocks. The Dow Jones (DIA), which suffered its worst performance since October 2020 last week continued to recover, pushed higher by a rally in bank and industrial stocks. “Reopening stocks” like cruise lines, hotels, and airlines continue to underperform the market, pressured by the rotation back to growth and concerns that inflation will drive prices in this sector higher. 

After driving the market higher in the beginning of the year, the last two or so months have seen the market firmly rotate from value and cyclical stocks back to growth and technology stocks due to recent inflationary numbers and labor market disruption that threaten to drive prices for services in this sector higher. However, as I have said previously, while I acknowledge the risk, I am not yet concerned that current inflation will become a persistent threat, at least in the near-term. While that may change and I advise people to be ready in case the Fed is forced to tighten rates sooner-than-expected, I expect value and cyclicals to continue recovering as the US economy continues to reopen. With the stock market’s great performance in the last 12-14 months and government coronavirus stimulus, I expect savings-laden consumers to spend big this summer after being cooped up indoors for so long. 

Keith Lerner, Portfolio and Market Strategist at Truist Securities said, “The value trade is still intact. It got overcrowded, it got over-loved ... but when we look at the fundamental drivers behind that trade, they're still intact. So the first thing is, context. Yes, they had a big run this year, but they've trailed for about 14 years, so we've had a long underperformance cycle,"" he added. ""And the second part is, why did they underperform for so long is because we had really slow economic growth. And this year and next we expect above-trend economic growth. And the earnings momentum and the earnings leverage for these areas is still positive."" 

Later today, the Fed is set to release the results of its “stress test” on the US largest banks, an annual test meant to test the financial health of lenders that was instituted following the 2009 financial crisis. The tests are designed to see how banks would fare during a hypothetical extreme economic downturn (not unlike what banks experienced last year). This stress test is extremely important because last year, during the height of the pandemic, the Fed imposed restrictions on banks on capital distributions like dividends and buybacks in order to ensure banks would have enough capital to weather the storm. Thanks to those measures, plus low interest rates and government stimulus that held off loan losses, analysts expect banks to perform well on Thursday, which would lead the Fed to lift remaining capital distribution curbs, opening the floodgates for banks to increase dividends and reinstitute stock buy back programs. **If these restrictions are fully lifted, the six largest banks in the US - Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup, Goldman Sachs (GS), JP Morgan (JPM), Morgan Stanley (MS) and Wells Fargo (WFC) - are expected to increase payouts by $66 billion to $130 billion over the next four quarters. This is huge if it happens.** 

On Friday, Later this week, investors will receive the latest update on core personal consumption expenditures (PCE), which serves as the Fed's preferred gauge of inflation. The report due for release on Friday is expected to register a 3.4% year-on-year increase for May, marking the fastest jump since 1992, albeit while still reflecting ""base effects"" as prices rebound after last year's pandemic-induced collapse in prices across the board

**Highlights**

* **As I was finishing the recap the news is out, the Fed is ending pandemic-era restriction on banks in stock buybacks and dividend increases. This is great news for banks.** More information here [https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/24/business/fed-bank-stress-tests.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/24/business/fed-bank-stress-tests.html)
* After being under pressure in recent months, shares of Tesla (TSLA) have begun rallying again, with the stock up more than 10% this week alone. 
* Today, Microsoft will unveil the long-awaited sequel to Windows 10. Windows 11, the product's first new version in almost six years, includes only limited changes to its visual design, but it seeks to reposition the operating system as a hub in a computing universe incorporating rival companies' platforms, including Android mobile software developed by Google and a digital storefront developed by Amazon (AMZN).[ Read more here ](https://www.cnet.com/news/microsofts-windows-11-reveal-event-every-upgrade-announced/)
* The House Judiciary Committee voted on Thursday to approve the final piece of its six-part package, the ""Ending Platform Monopolies Act,"" which restricts big tech companies' ability to leverage their platform dominance to promote other lines of business and disadvantage competitors. The vote on the bill was 21-20. The bill will now move on to the House floor and, if passed there, the Senate. The bill is newsworthy but pretty much doomed to fail.
* Snapchat (SNAP) users globally will get access to Universal Music Group's library of recorded music and content for their own content-making on the social media platform, the companies said Thursday. This move comes as US social media companies across the board continue to implement more “TikTok-like” features. To show just how much TikTok has grown, parent company ByteDancehas a market cap of roughly $250 billion, almost $100 billion more than Snap and Twitter (TWTR) combined. 
* **Cathie Wood** and Twitter and Square (SQ) CEO Jack Dorsey have been named as co-hosts of “The ₿ Word,” a new initiative designed to bring business and technology leaders together to discuss how institutions can use digital currencies.

This is to be included in the ‘22 model of the XC90. Looks like this is for highway driving only and utilizes sensor fusion (LiDAR, cameras, radar). Volvo is claiming this will be an “eyes off, hands off, brain off” autonomous system. They (Volvo) are also willing to take full liability for accidents that occur while the system is enabled.

This uses Luminar’s Sentinel system which Luminar is claiming is a full-stack autonomous solution for self-driving vehicles. 

It looks like this model has been delayed a few times (apparently it was scheduled to be available to customers late 2021), but it looks like Volvo is saying it will be available next year.

stocks,"Using historical PE Ratio data, QQQ is nowhere near ""tech bubble"" territory like it was in 2000. TLDR: QQQ current PE ratio is mid 30s, in March 2000 it was 190. QQQ might be overvalued, but it's hard to make the case that it is in a bubble.

I have heard people say that the Nasdaq and technology in general is in a bubble. While you can certainly make a case that it is overvalued, there are some key differences to the tech/dotcom dubble of 2000 that would make it unfair to say that we are that those levels. 

There are definitely tech stocks that show similarities to the stocks that were responsible for 2000 tech crash, such as little to no earnings, pe ratios at 100, 500, or even 1000. But the tech sector and QQQ, which is overweight in tech, is not showing these bubble like characteristics. Most of these companies are large or mega cap companies with years of solid growth and profitability. Yes, they could very well be overvalued, but investing in overvalued companies or sectors is still reasonable if you buy and hold into them with a long time horizon, while dollar cost averaging. 

The current PE ratio of QQQ is somewhere in the mid 30s. The historical PE ratio of QQQ in March 2000 was 190."

stocks,"$WUGI ETF is a great opportunity to Invest on time in the 5G Technology and Semiconductor Industry.  **$WUGI 5G Technology ETF**

 WUGI is an actively-managed ETF, been holding for a month with nice gains that dont appear to slow down.  

We agree that 5G will empower the next generation of technology that will  rise the global digital economy. 

5G is not a light-switch; it is an evolution. They invest in that long-term growth with adjusting allocations  dynamically as the 5G cycle evolves. 

There 5G assumptions are based on 4 Pillars.. 

1.  **Semis are the nucleus of 5G**:  Every existing device and every facet of the 5G cycle must be upgraded with new semiconductor technology to run faster and smarter, while being more energy-efficient. 5G will require a massive expansion of semiconductor content.  **Because everything needs a Semi now! From your cellphone to your washing machines, Cars, Smart Homes, Drones. Heaviest investment sector of this ETF, companies like $AMD $TSMC $NVDA $QCOM.**
2.  **Cloud giants push into Edge Computing**:   Edge Computing and 5G are interlinked technologies as both are poised to significantly improve the performance of applications (faster speed) and enable huge amounts of data to be processed in real-time (low latency). Applications running on edge locations demand lower latency and reduced bandwidth. **FAAMG stocks come into play here and are VERY important.**
3.  **Cloud-native software to manage data**:  5G will result in a massive amount of new data. The ability to continuously filter and process this new data in real-time will be critical. A new generation of database platforms, big data analytics, and agile software development tools are emerging to help individuals and businesses build digital experiences. **$NVDA and its Datacenter come to play, $NET, $TWLO, $AMZN AWS. The growth will not slow down.** 
4.  **Enabling Technologies**:  When all 5G building blocks are in place, the potential big winners will likely be the enabling technologies (think of Instagram and Netflix in the 4G cycle), giving rise to a wave of new 5G business applications, devices, and services. **Companies like $SE with huge gaming plataforms, as the cycle evolves there will be clearer players here.**

**% Top 10 Holdings**: Sea Ltd 7.98%  NVIDIA Corp 7.97%  AMD 7.94% Meituan Dianping 5.85% Marvell Technology Group Ltd 5.44% Qualcomm Inc 5.26%  Bilibili Inc 4.32%  Taiwan Semiconductors 4.09% Google 4.05% Microsoft Corp 3.70%

The drug works in a similar manner to Biogen's Aduhelm, which was approved earlier this month. It removes sticky deposits of a protein called amyloid beta from the brains of patients in the earlier stages of Alzheimer's in order to stave off its impact, including memory loss and the inability to take care of oneself.

Lecanemab is also being studied in a large trial on people with evidence of amyloid in their brains, who do not yet have symptoms of the disease.

The FDA grants breakthrough therapy designation in order to expedite the development and review of medicines for serious or life-threatening conditions.

Bitfarms ($BITF), based out of Canada, is a Bitcoin mining company. They just IPO'd on the nasdaq Monday. Currently trading around $4.50 per share. They' mined 11,300 BTC since 2017. All mining operations use 100% renewable energy.

SOS Limited ($SOS), based out of China, just recently got involved in crypto. They have recently entered into a joint venture with Niagra development LLC, based out of New Jersey (US), to begin BTC mining operations in the U.S. They have ETH rigs still in China unaffected by the crackdown. More than 90% of their crypto mining rigs use renewable energy. They are also in the process of developing a digital currency exchange (like a Coinbase). And use Blockchain technology for their emergency services offered in China. Currently trading around $3.40 a share. They confirmed Q1 mining produced 42 BTC and 918 ETH. They have since added 10,000+ additional rigs.


I believe with crypto down right now, these 2 stocks are great opportunities for people to start loading up."

stocks,"Why I'm So Bullish on $CAT **Caterpillar ($CAT)** is the global leader and largest producer of construction and mining equipment for a reason, and with all the looming infrastructure talks I'm more bullish on Caterpillar than ever. They have set themselves up perfectly to benefit exponentially from the increase in demand in the construction and mining sectors. The $117 billion market capitalization company also provides diesel and natural gas engines, industrial gas turbines and diesel-electric locomotives. At the time of writing this they are up 74% YTD. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Financials &amp; Growth Prospective:**  Caterpillar has experienced a 74% year-over-year improvement in the first-quarter 2021 adjusted earnings per share to $1.93, while revenues increased 12% year over year to $11.9 billion. Over the past two months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Caterpillar for fiscal 2021 has increased around 17%. The consensus mark for fiscal 2022 has also been revised upward by 11% over the same time frame. Caterpillar has outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 41.6%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings for fiscal 2021 for Caterpillar is currently pegged at $9.60, suggesting year-over-year growth of 46%. For fiscal 2022, the estimate for earnings is at $11.91, indicating year-over-year improvement of 24%. 

We can expect that the growth in construction -- not just in the U.S. but worldwide -- will allow Caterpillar to grow earnings-per-share by more than 40% in 2021. This would leave the bottom line still much lower than its pre-pandemic highs, but it would be a very good showing nonetheless. With a new annualized dividend of $4.44 ($1.11/quarter) as of August 20th, 2020, and an expectation for earnings-per-share of $9.20 for 2021, Caterpillar has a projected payout ratio of 48%. This is slightly above the average payout ratio of 45% since 2011. The dividend appears to be well-covered and unlikely to be cut even if earnings-per-share experience another significant decline. 

&amp;#x200B;

**In The News:**

* **Collaborative development of zero-emission mining equipment:** $CAT recently entered into a collaboration agreement with Nouveau Monde Graphite Inc. to develop, test and produce zero-emission machines for the latter’s Matawinie graphite mine. Caterpillar expects to become the exclusive supplier of an all-electric mining fleet for the mine by 2028. The Matawinie project, which will provide high-purity graphite concentrate for electric vehicles, is planned to be the first open pit operation in the world that will exclusively use electric equipment. This is an important milestone in the mining industry as it can be used as a launch pad for other miners focused on cutting down their emissions utilizing Caterpillar’s cutting-edge technologies. 
* **Rio Tinto Plc announced it will deploy the world’s first fully autonomous water truck in partnership with Caterpillar:** This will be located at its $2.6 billion Gudai-Darri iron ore mine in Western Australia’s Pilbara region. Water spraying is a vital part of mining operations and this new technology will enhance productivity by enabling digital tracking of water consumption, while cutting down water wastage. Rio Tinto intends to make Gudai-Darri one of the world’s most technologically advanced mines. Cutting down mining sector’s carbon emissions is the need of the hour. Day by day, more and more mining companies are exploring options to electrify their mines. The switch from diesel to electricity will also cut costs and boost their license to operate. Electrified mines will require less maintenance and human intervention. The use of automation and the Internet of Things (IoT) will increase as drones, autonomous vehicles and remote-controlled operational systems are rolled out more widely across mining operations."

Today is the IPO of Doximity. It is an app (saas) that is a mix between telehealth and a social media platform for doctors, nurse practitioners, PAs, dentists, etc. They are one of a kind in that they’re the only ones with this scope in the industry having the social media platform plus telehealth all in one. 80% (me included) of all doctors in the US use doximity. They also allow you to find jobs in your field and keep you up to date on the latest research. It is going to debut for 26$ and boy is that a deal. 

This business has a market cap around 4 bil and is the market leader in an industry (telehealth, social media for professionals) that is about to drip like the oil boom. According to their S1, this industry is worth ~18 bil and is growing rapidly. That is telehealth. That does not include all the other aspects of this business. Last year alone over 63 million telehealth visits occurred. There are so many implications for this service (seeing patients unable to make it to clinic, counseling, etc). This is just the tip of the ice berg. With the money from the ipo they plan to grow rapidly and may incorporate an electronic medical records with this service eventually, which is fucking huge. It would make my life so much easier lol. 

Within the last year revenue grew 78% from 116.4 mil to 206 mil. They also are already positive with earnings. Their biggest competitor, tdoc, (look at what they ipo at and now) are not profitable. This company is about to fucking boom don’t miss out. I’ve included a few of my sources.

stocks,"Visa to buy Swedish fintech Tink for $2.1 billion after abandoning Plaid takeover  LONDON — Visa agreed Thursday to acquire Swedish financial technology start-up Tink for 1.8 billion euros ($2.1 billion), in a deal aimed at bolstering the payment giant’s digital ambitions.

The deal comes after Visa’s bid to buy Plaid, an American rival to Tink, was torpedoed by U.S. regulators. Plaid has since opted to go it alone as an independent company, and was last privately valued by investors at $13.4 billion.

Both Plaid and Tink operate in a nascent space known as opening banking, which calls on lenders to provide third-party firms with access to coveted consumer banking data, provided they’ve got consent. Open banking has flourished in Britain and the EU thanks to new regulation.

“Visa is committed to doing all we can to foster innovation and empower consumers in support of Europe’s open banking goals,” Al Kelly, Visa’s CEO, said in a statement.

 “By bringing together Visa’s network of networks and Tink’s open banking capabilities we will deliver increased value to European consumers and businesses with tools to make their financial lives more simple, reliable and secure.”

Founded by Swedish entrepreneurs Daniel Kjellén and Fredrik Hedberg in 2012, Tink initially started out as a financial management app but later pivoted to focus on providing its technology to other businesses instead.

Tink’s technology lets banks and fintech firms access banking data to create new financial products. The Stockholm-based company was last privately valued at 680 million euros. It has raised more than $300 million from investors including PayPal, SEB and ABN AMRO.

“As we got to know Visa, it became clear that we share a common mission – to connect the financial world and accelerate the growth and adoption of digital financial services,” Tink’s founders said in a blog post Thursday.

 “Teaming up with Visa means we’ll now be able to move faster and reach further than ever before, and we know that Visa is the perfect partner for the next stage of our journey.”

Visa’s acquisition of Tink is the latest in a wave of consolidation efforts in the massive payments industry. The company had tried to buy Plaid last year, but ultimately abandoned the takeover after the U.S. Department of Justice sued to block it on antitrust grounds.

The deal with Tink is subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions, Visa said, adding it will be financed solely with cash and won’t impact the company’s stock buyback program or dividend policy.

Tink will keep its branding and management team after the deal, Visa said, while the company’s headquarters will also remain in Stockholm.

""In total, the mass claim can amount to more than 1.4 billion euros, based on the more than 1 million Dutch minor users,"" SOMI said to RTL Nieuws. 

So far over 64 thousand parents in the European Union joined this case, the foundation said. According to SOMI, TikTok is violating multiple European laws, including privacy laws and laws that prohibit targeting advertisements at children. The app also doesn't properly ask permission for data use, and does not say which data is collected for which purposes. And the Chinese company behind the app collects and stores more data than necessary, and doesn't meet the legal requirements for keeping that data safe, the foundation said. 

SOMI also believes that TikTok doesn't comply with European media rules that are intended to ""protect children from harmful content"", partly referring to online challenges in which children challenge each other to do dangerous things. ""SOMI also believes that more general videos on TikTok can be harmful to young children, for example because of hidden advertisements for harmful products and content that promotes unrealistic ideals of beauty, which can lead to problems such as self-harm and eating disorders.""

The foundation's hope for this case is to get a legal ruling that forces TikTok to adjust its actions. ""A court decision can directly restrict the practices of TikTok - and other social media platforms,"" SOMI co-founder Cor Wijtvliet said to the broadcaster. ""We have sent letters of complaints to TikTok and several European supervisory authorities in the past year, but have not seen any substantive results. That is why we have decided not to wait for the investigations by the authorities and to take legal action ourselves.""

A spokesperson for TikTok told RTL Nieuws that the privacy and safety of its users have ""the highest priority"". ""We are taking industry-leading steps to promote youth security on TikTok, such as setting accounts to Private by default for users under the age of 16, and enabling parents to link their account to their teenage child's through Family Pairing. We continue to evaluate and improve our policies, processes and systems, and continue to consult with external experts.""

Officially, TikTok can only be used by children aged 13 or older, and minors need their parents' permission. In practice, however, these age limits are not well enforced. Earlier this year, a court in Italy ordered TikTok to block users who did not confirm their age, after a 10-year-old girl died in a dangerous challenge on the social media platform.

stocks,"Visa to buy Swedish fintech Tink for $2.2 billion Visa Inc said on Thursday it had agreed a 1.8 billion euro ($2.2 billion) takeover of European open banking platform Tink, months after it ditched a planned acquisition of the startup's U.S. rival Plaid.

Founded in 2012, Sweden-based Tink enables banks and other financial firms to access consumer financial data more easily. It is used by more than 3,400 banks and other institutions, as well as over 250 million customers across Europe.

Visa was forced to terminate a planned $5.3 billion deal with U.S. data-sharing platform Plaid in January, following a U.S. government lawsuit aimed at blocking the deal on antitrust grounds.

Visa said the Tink deal was subject to regulatory approvals.

European Union rules on open banking, also adopted by Britain before it left the bloc, require banks to allow access to customer data by registered third party providers to boost competition.

The rollout of the rules has provided fertile ground for fintechs, such as Tink, which provide technology to help third parties and banks to access customer data.

Visa would retain Tink's brand and management team, and its headquarters would stay in Stockholm, the company said.

The Tink takeover included cash and retention incentives, Visa said, adding the deal would have no impact on its previously announced stock buyback or dividend policy.

stocks,"AMD - A Diamond in the Rough I’m struggling to see how such a solid technology company can be trading at less than 9x Price/Sales. 

I mean, even apart from Lisa Su’s objective awesomeness as an Executive, consistently strong Revenue Growth and Earnings beats, this damn company is promising. Quarter after quarter it’s eating away at Intel’s market share, product users are continually impressed, and massive players like Tesla and Google are confident enough to back it. Even AMD wants to buy back it’s own shares at this price.

And what? Waiting for the XLNX deal has removed the entire speculative aspect of the stock market? A chip shortage, in part, due to an increase in CONSUMER DEMAND during the pandemic? Am I missing something here?

I know some investors may be able to make a reasonable bear case, given some unlikely circumstances, but do you honestly think this valuation is unwarranted (let alone significantly low in this market environment)?

stocks,"UFO report supposed to be released by Friday - MAXR, IRDM, SPCE will benefit The report is required to be released by this Friday (June 25). No matter what the report says, it will help the space industry. Whether the UFO's are other countries, our government, or aliens, there will be increasing interest in space when people start to realize what is possible. See Navy pilots descriptions of the ""tic-tac"" UFO if you want to learn more.

I found that Maxar Technologies (MAXR) is the most solid space company. See the other post I made if you are interested.  
IRDM is good although I don't know too much about them. They aren't as diversified as Maxar it doesn't seem.

SPCE is overvalued or maybe appropriately valued. Before I put any money in, I would want them to announce plans for regular space travel (like New York to Beijing flights) before I would invest. Just selling short trips for rich people to go up seems like a waste."
stocks,"Doximity IPO prices at $26 (above initial range of $20 - $23 a share) (Crossposted and slightly modified due to audience, from r/residents as DOCS was being offered to physicians)

I'm a new here but since I see some posts about it, might as well start with this.

I'm a physician in California, 20 years out from residency.

I've been investing with my Stafford Loan $ since MS I and endured several serious market crashes. I enjoy doing financial analysis and have successfully invested in multiple IPOs in the past, including google, mastercard, visa, interactive brokers, and evercore financial. I still HODL GOOG, MA, and V; sold EVR at a modest profit and roughly broke even on IBKR.

This is completely divorced from what I think about the app or the company (I don't like the fax function, don't usually read its articles, and primarily use it so that when I call patients they can't see my mobile #), I am focusing purely on the financials reported by the company. I would be interested in seeing if anyone else has picked up anything that I have blind spots for and cannot see. Thanks in advance.

**tl;dr**: DOCS hits every thing I want to see in (any) company going public. I committed a full 250 share allotment on Fidelity after I had passed on an opportunity to purchase pre-IPO shares through EquityZen

**First.** The [S-1](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001516513/000162828021011269/doximity-sx1.htm) filing is located here.

**Second,** Their financials. For any company you want to look at:

* Revenue (also called 'top line')
* Operating Expenses
* Profit (also called 'bottom line') which is more or less revenue - expenses
* Cash on hand
* Debt
* Why they are going IPO

You want to see that the company is making money both top line and bottom line, you want to see that their costs are not outstripping their revenue and profit growth. **When you are investing in a stock, you are basically laying an (educated) bet that the company will grow their profits. When they grow, your stock grows.**

For the last bullet, you want to see that they have money so that they won't go bankrupt. Generally for why IPO, if the prospectus says, ""to pay back debt"" or ""the company will not receive any proceeds"" then stay the hell away. You want the company to use the money they raise to fund new ventures or anything that will help them grow.

So, under the hood (and very simplified):

&amp;#x200B;

||2019|2020|2021|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Revenues|85.7mm|116.4mm (+30.7%)|206.9mm (+78%)|
|Expenses|67.9mm|79.3mm (+16.8%)|122.4mm (+54.3%)|
|Profit|7.8mm|23.5mm (+201%)|57.7mm (+145%)|

What do we see:

* Increasing rate of change growth in revenue from 2019 -&gt; 2020, and 2020 -&gt; 2021
* Increasing expenses but rate of change is not as much as rate of change of revenues
* Profit every year. Though 2020 - 2021 growth is not as much as 2019 - 2020, it's still more than doubled

DOCS has 142mm in cash on hand, and the only ""debt"" they have is in the form of convertible preferred stock - i.e. no loans taken out.

Why are they IPOing? They are going to use the funds to support growth and investments in the business, or to acquire or invest in complementary businesses or assets.

**In Summary**.

Solely from a financial perspective, the company grows revenues and profits year over year. Their expenses are growing but not as rapidly - plus if you dive into their S-1 they have a significant portion of those expenses used for research and development, which in my mind is actually not an expense but more of an investment in their future. They have cash on hand and no debt. It's a slam dunk and I am not surprised that the IPO priced 3 dollars above their upper range because everyone with financial know how and the ability to get their hands on the stock wanted it.

Cheers and best wishes.

stocks,"Maxar Technologies (MAXR) is an undervalued space stock Hi all,

  
I’ve spent the past month learning what I can about the space industry and the companies involved.  **Long story short** – Maxar Technologies (MAXR) is the best buy in aerospace right now.   
Maxar is the market leader in both satellite imagery and satellite development for space exploration.  Here is an overview:  


* Maxar has built over 285 different satellites over the years, for various commercial and government customers or for their own constellations.
* Maxar is a frequent contractor for NASA and is the industry leader in robotic arms and electric propulsion technology.
* For the upcoming Moon mission, Maxar is contracted to build the propulsion and communication module – a large and critical part of the spacecraft. 
* Maxar provides 90% of the geospatial intelligence used by the U.S. military
* 3.8 billion people use Maxar imagery every day – through online maps like Google Maps and through telecommunications companies
* Maxar will be critical to innovation globally going forward – every industry and government will increase their use of geospatial technology and Maxar will be the principal company they rely on. 

With a market cap of only $2.8 billion (plus 1.5% insider ownership), Maxar is highly undervalued.  Wall Street analysts give the stock a price target of $52-$60 which would be a 37% gain from where it is now.  I think it is worth a lot more, although I am no expert.

There is a $25 billion pipeline of aerospace contracts over the next five years (a figure being cited by multiple aerospace companies) and Maxar will be in a great position to capitalize on the growing opportunities.  As the market continues to grow, Maxar will become an increasingly bigger player going forward. 

Stock history:

The stock started trading in 2004 at around $20/share.  It peaked from 2014-2015 at $80/share.  Then it crashed from 2016-2018 - hitting a low of $5/share - because of concerns over the amount of debt the company was holding.  Since then, Maxar sold off a portion of the company to a Canadian subsidiary and balanced their budget.  Since 2019 the stock has shown solid growth, now sitting at around $40.   
FYI: For some reason the Fidelity and Robinhood charts only show the stock history since 2017.  Look on Google for the full chart since 2004."

stocks,"How to invest in the future of water I've been looking at these ETFs: 

*  FIW PHO CWW CGW PIO EBLU (in order of preference)

I just put them all into Trading View Charts and noticed FIW doing the best and EBLU the worst. I also used other compare tools, and noticed the same pattern again. FIW always coming out on top and EBLU at the bottom. I noticed PHO had better fundamentals than FIW even though FIW was always the top line in the performance chart? 

FIW seems more international while PHO is mostly USA, so I will probably have to discount PHO, as I want more international exposure in this sub-industry! 

CWW is based in Canada and pays quarterly dividends. 

So far, I'm leaning toward FIW. Or Maybe CWW (as I am in Canada). 

Is there something else I can try to get a more concentre understanding of how to compare ETFs effectively?"
stocks,"DD: $WWR, WestWater Resources - Graphite (This goes into EV batteries, approx 70-200lbs per car) So I saw this $WWR ticker a while back, some scam shit $1.5 to $15 back to $5 classic p&amp;d penny stock mining uranium or some shit.  Or so I thought.  Some 10 months later I saw $WWR again, this time I decided to have a look.  As it turns out, this is actually a real company, not some phony research project brought to the OTC's as a ""stock.  It's a small stock, but real.

The reason it had shot up $1.5 to $15 long ago was an executive order by the president to secure supply of things like graphite inside of the US.  Currently 0% of our graphite is produced in this country (we have literally no mining, production, or synthetic production here) and it was seen as a problem since it's important and a bunch comes from China.  Based on my DD, the stock went dormant since then as they were awaiting business moves.

Just yesterday they made a big announcement with the first U.S. graphite production facility, announced by the governor of Alabama to be in the great state of Alabama near what I understand to be the U.S.'s largest graphite deposit (owned by $WWR I believe).  The plant is not a MINE, the mine is coming later, these guys are buying the mined graphite (not ready for use at all in products) and bringing it up to usable purity, then they plan to bring the mine up to self-feed.

These people are the ONLY people inside the united states producing graphite.  Graphite is one of only 2 forms of carbon found in the earth's crust, the other being diamonds.  Synthetic graphite is possible but currently approx 50% more expensive (just released june 4th 3 weeks ago by white house review) and it's made from coke stockfeed from coal or some shit, but these people at $WWR are also approaching that angle which I like, they can work from mined graphite and also pivot to synthetic graphite if it becomes cheaper.  No one else in the U.S. can produce this stuff.  Anything from 70-200 lbs of graphite per typical car up to like 400 lbs for the new ford lightning.

There are a few other companies like NMG trying to produce graphite, they are all about similar size and nascent, caps in the 50-350m range, WWR is at 170m.  $WWR is the only US, major exchange listed (NYSE) company and tbh it seems more stable and legit where as the other ones seem like hedge fund backed yolos that just shut down in 9 months, this company had actually existed.

Battery production is going to grow in the US especially with Biden's whole $170B EV plan where he plans to make the US the EV leader, I think this shit is really important.  $WWR just happens to be the right company at the right time, getting lucky and benefitting from world events and developments of the economy.  I think this really could be a gem.

The stock's lifetime value graph is classic small company goes bankrupt after a while, similar to all the biotech stocks before corona, or like PLUG, or like WKHS, there are many.  It's a concern of course but again I think right time, these $WWR guys are just lucky, as the other names i listed were, and can rebound successfully off of the $1.5 range, still only approx $5.50 range, having seen $15, and push towards $30-40 as the other names have."
stocks,"I bought my first stock (PLUG) today at age 31. I have been looking at stock trends without buying for a few months, and I’ve noticed some trends.

The trend that stood out to me most was what I think of as a “scoop”. This is probably very elementary stuff, and I’m sure there are technical terms that I am unaware of.

When I say scoop, I mean a stock that ramped up at some point then quickly dropped back down. After that, stocks seem to stay low and keep dropping but at a slower and slower rate. Eventually it evens out and starts to climb back up, usually to about 75% of its previous peak.

So my goal has been to find stocks that just finished leveling out and are starting to “scoop” back up to that 75%.

I have been viewing this trend in 3m, 6m, 1yr, and 5yr ranges because I don’t have an interest in day trading, and I prefer a slower, safer climb.

So I have a few questions:

1. Is this a decent approach?

2. Does it have a name?

3. Are there other good companies out there showing a similar mid-to-long-term trends that I should look into?

Of course, I’m not asking for or giving financial advice. Thanks!"
stocks,"The DOW is price weighted, should that mean that United health and other higher priced stocks potentially could split? So, I was doing some research on the Dow and how it functions. I know it is price weighted, therefore higher priced stocks have a greater impact on the Dow’s value than lower priced stocks. 

I began to look through the different companies within the Dow and came across UnitedHealth ($UNH). They are currently trading at $396 per share, which is far and above the rest of the pack. 

Goldman at 360 and Home Depot at 312.. after that it falls off to Microsoft at 265. 

So with UnitedHealth having such a heavy weight over everything else, what’s the chance we see some sort of stock split news out of them. They are trading around the same price of apple when they announced their stock split.

stocks,"Are the majority of people that discuss short attacks and ladder attacks joking, or do you think they are actually serious? Lately I've found myself bored with a lot of free time so I've been looking at stock discussion involving my holdings on various forum boards.


Time and time again, I've noticed the discussion is focused on how shorts are causing price drops and initiating ladder attacks. The logical discussion seems to get no traction, meanwhile people are writing essays about complete nonsense. 

What I find most astonishing though is that the percentage of shares shorted is publicly available, and on all of my personal holdings less than 0.5% of the share float is shorted. This obviously discrediting any proposed idea of a short / ladder attack.

So I have to ask, are most people that partake in stock discussion generally that dumb, that they believe everything is a short / ladder attacks.

stocks,"Understanding margin calls and maintenance requirements Can someone help me clear up a misconception I seem to be having with the following example of a margin call scenario? 

Assuming there are no other marginable securities in the account, an investor with a $4000 credit balance purchased 1000 shares of a marginable stock when it was trading at $5 per share, creating a $1000 debit. 

The general maintenance requirement would be 30% or $1500. If the stock price fell to $2, the margin maintenance requirement would be 100% or $2000, and a margin call would be issued for $1000. (Equity of $1000 -$2000 requirement equals $1000 maintenance deficiency). 

An investor would be required to deposit $1000 in cash or $1,428.57 in marginable securities (stocks priced over $4 per share), into their margin account, or sell any non-marginable assets held in the account.

In this case, would the investor have a to liquidate $1,428.57 worth of securities instead of just $1000 worth of securities?"

* All  these brands are providing products and services to protect against  mosquitoes, termites, roaches or ants but also against wildlife (animals  like rats, snakes, skunks or gophers).  
* As  dominant player in the pest and termite services market, Rollins  provides pest (insect and rodent) and termite control services to over  2.4 million residential and commercial customers. 
* When  looking at some of the brands, Orkin is the most important one (it is  employing about 8,000 people) and was already founded in 1901 by  14-year-old Otto Orkin and has more than 100 years of experience in pest  control services specializing in protection against common pests,  including termites, rodents and insects.  
* HomeTeam Pest Defense was established in 1996 and is the number one pest management company providing services to home builders.  
* Clark  Pest Control is the leading pest management company in California and  Northwest Exterminating provides pest control, termite, and wildlife  services for approximately 120,000 customers in Georgia, South Carolina,  Tennessee, Alabama and North Carolina. 
* Stable  revenue and earnings per share growth, which are also hints that we are  dealing with a company that has an economic moat around its business. 
* Although  Rollins has only one reportable segment (the pest and termite control  business), its revenue can be split up in three different business  segments. 
* About  18% of revenue stems from termite control sales (with a retention rate  of about 85%) and about 81% of revenue stems from pest control with  these sales being split up in residential pest control sales  contributing about 42-43% to overall revenue (with about 76% to 85%  retention rate) and about 40% of sales stemming from commercial pest  control (with a retention rate of 88% to 90%). 
* The  biggest part of revenue is generated in the United States. In 2019  about 92% of revenue ($1,863 million) was generated in the United States  with $153 million in revenue stemming from other countries.  
* Rollins  also uses a franchise system (especially Orkin) with more than 200  franchises worldwide in more than 800 locations and is trying to expand  its growth. This program is primarily used in smaller markets where it  is currently not commercially feasible to locate a conventional Orkin  branch.  
* Right now, the international and domestic franchising revenue is less than 1% of the company's revenue. 
* Rollins'  business is affected a little bit by seasonal aspects as revenue is  usually the lowest in the first quarter of the year and the highest in  the second and third quarters. As bugs thrive in warm weather it is not  really a surprise, that revenue for Rollins is the highest in the summer  months.  
* But  aside from the seasonal aspects, Rollins' revenue is extremely stable  and the business is recession-proof to a very high degree. Pest control  is important every year and as termites or bugs don't care about  economic expansions, recessions or the business cycle, customers will  need the products and services of Rollins even in economic downturns. 
* The  fact that Rollins is a recession-proof business can also be seen by  looking at the last quarterly numbers. In the second quarter, total  revenue could increase 5.6% despite a global economic downturn and for  the first half of 2020, revenue could increase even 9.2% and net income  could increase 9.3% (both compared to the same timeframe last year). 
* Rollins  could not only report very stable revenue growth during the last  decade, but the future is also looking bright as the company is  operating in an attractive industry, which will be able to grow in the  mid-single digits in the years to come. 
* Rollins will continue to focus on acquisitions. 
* The  number of households served could be increased in the United States as  currently only about 10 million households are served by Rollins and its  competitors. 
* Aside  from private households, many businesses could also become potential  customers. Increasing regulations could force more and more restaurants,  hotels and similar businesses to use more rigid pest control.  
* Additionally,  Rollins could expand globally. Right now, international revenue is only  contributing about 8% to the business' top line and with more and more  people moving to cities and the rising middle class there are a lot of  potential new customers as the urban middle class are Rollins' target  group. 
* And  as pest generally thrives in warmer climate, global warming could be  another tailwind for the entire industry and also for Rollins (not just  in the United States). 
* The termite damage today is already $5.6 billion annually and this threat to home owner could be even worse in the future. 
* Mosquito products and services could be another strategic growth opportunity, but in 2018 revenue was only $22 million.  
* And  finally, Rollins could increase its revenue by increasing its market  share. Right now, Rollins has a market share of 20% - pretty much the  same as competitor ServiceMaster (SERV)  and although I would not count on it, increasing its market share is  another possibility for increasing revenue in the years to come. 
* Aside  from Terminix - which is the subsidiary of ServiceMaster, that Rollins  is mostly competing with - the main competitors are Rentokil (OTCPK:RKLIF) and Ecolab (ECL). Additionally, Rollins is competing with the Swedish pest control company Anticimex. 
* In  the past, Rollins has acquired many former competitors and will  probably continue to do so in the years to come. This leads to a  consolidation in the business and might not only increase Rollins'  market share, but also make the industry more concentrated, which is  good for Rollins as it gives the company more pricing power due to  reduced competition. 
* The  combination of the industry consolidation by acquisitions and the  relative high market share Rollins has leads to a stable and good  competitive situation for Rollins in the coming years. 
* Due  to its high market share, Rollins (as well as Terminix) can easily  retaliate against new competitors (for example increasing the pressure  on new companies by lowering prices for some time).  
* Overall,  the barriers to entry are not as high as they might be in some other  industries, but they are creating some challenges for new competitors  that are trying to enter the industry. 
* Rollins  also has a highly fragmented customer base with about 2 million  individual customers. The company has not just small individual  households as clients, but even the bigger clients make up only a very  small percentage of total revenue. The largest national accounts make up  less than 3% of the revenue. This high level of fragmentation gives  Rollins bargaining power over its customers. 
* Despite  the fact that customers can switch to competitors, it is very hard for  individual customers to put pressure on Rollins. Threatening to switch  to a competitor won't make much difference for Rollins as long as it is  just one individual customer.  
* The  product differentiation and the customer relations will also lead to  some form of bargaining power over the customers and are decreasing the  willingness to switch. 
* Another  important aspect is the fact that Rollins is a classical family  business and usually these types of business are very successful and  provide high levels of stability and consistency in its operations.  
* Rollins  was not only founded by two brothers in 1948 - John W. Rollins and O.  Wayne Rollins - but is currently also run by two brothers. 
* Family  members are not only holding key management positions within the  company, but the Rollins family is also controlling about 55% of the  voting shares.  
* The  fact that the family has the voting power and is controlling key  management positions is usually a good sign for the company and its  shareholders as it is leading to stability and consistency. 
* Rollins  has certainly established a wide economic moat in its industry and this  moat is based on two aspects - the brand name on the one hand and cost  advantages on the other hand. 
* When talking about the brand name it is not so much Rollins as brand, but rather the subsidiaries - and especially Orkin.  
* The  brand name is leading to pricing power and Rollins can increase prices  every single year (every year in June, the company implements its  traditional price increase program and is increasing prices at least  1%). 
* The  brand name is certainly a short cut and is making the buying decision  for customers easier. Maybe it is also increasing the willingness to pay  a higher price. 
* The  economic moat is not just based on the brand name, but also on cost  advantages for Rollins. These cost advantages are mostly based on the  fact that Rollins is one of the two market leaders in a small niche it  is operating in. 
* As  the total pest control market is a smaller market, it might not be so  lucrative for big corporations and therefore Rollins is not confronted  with that kind of competition. In its small niche market, Rollins has  almost unmatched scale and it helps the company to be more efficient in  deploying certain fixed costs (such as training or marketing expenses). 
* During  the financial crisis, Rollins could increase revenue in 2008 as well as  in 2009. In 2008 revenue could increase 14.0% and in 2009 Rollins could  increase its revenue 5.2%. But Rollins could not only increase revenue,  but also net income could grow 6.5% in 2008 and 21.8% in 2009. 
* When  looking at the recession after the Dotcom bubble, we see a similar  picture although growth was not as high. In 2001, revenue could increase  0.5% and in 2002, revenue could increase 2.4% (net income also  increased in both years). 
* For  the last decade, Rollins could increase its revenue with a CAGR of  6.56% and net income with a CAGR of 9.22%. But when looking at the  long-term performance since 1980, revenue increased ""only"" 4.24%  annually on average and net income increased 4.61% annually an average.  
* Rollins  is certainly a good business, which could make a good long-term  investment. The business is not only recession-proof, but is also  controlled by the Rollins family and has a very stable management team.  It also has a wide economic moat around its business and growth  potential in the years to come. But the stock is extremely overvalued at  this point - even when calculating with very optimistic growth  assumptions - and therefore the stock can only remain on the watchlist  at this point."

stocks,"People start talking about managing risk and dealing with emotion after they crushed. Please, don't make this mistake.  In the beginning I shared one of the most dangerous bias of a young trader – I came to make money, not to lose it. This is fundamentally wrong. I spoke with many folks about it and they all seemed to have this bias. In fact taking small losses does not equal to losing money. There’s no way you can become a profitable trader if you are not ready to be wrong anytime you make a bet.

The key is how fast you understand your emotional trap and find a system to stick to it as much as you can. Self control is like a muscle you’ll develop it with time. It’s easier said than done. I continuously made errors on the market before I began to simply put stop loss and take profit. But this is simple enough to start. I followed recommendations from the traders I've found on thiq qooore app and set up everything without checking it try minute. This is good for beginners, before you start digging deeper into the books. I gradually changed my perspective and traded weeks after weeks sticking to the plan training my discipline. My personal book recommendations are: Beginner Trader Psychology Mastery Guidebook By Joseph Lira; The Psychology of Trading: Tools and Techniques for Minding the Market by Brett Steenbarger and Fooled by Randomness: The Hidden Role of Chance in Life and in the Markets by Taleb

Now I took all guesswork out of my stock trading – I keep diversified portfolio and dollar-cost averaging is a strategy investing equal sum at a regular, predetermined intervals. My emotions are not attached with the real money trading.

stocks,"KPLT Undervalued - Big Potential Growth (DD)  

**Why KPLT is undervalued and overlooked?**

Katapult Holdings (KPLT) is a financing platform that focuses on non-prime, online customers. KPLT is the leading “buy now, pay later” service with dirt cheap evaluation and potential to grow. KPLT is very profitable, has quick growth potential, and is trading for much less than its peers.

**Why will KPLT grow?**

The Federal Reserve Bank of New York states that 38% of US consumers are non-prime. That’s a huge market Katapult to grow off of. With Katapult being partnered with merchants like Wayfair, Motorola, Purple, Nectar, and Lenovo, Katapult already has their foot in the door to sell to non-prime consumers.

When a consumer fails a prime lending application from companies like Affirm or PayPal, they are passed on to Katapult. Katapult offers them different kinds of payment options depending on what they can afford.

*Katapult is the only nonprime consumer POS lease financing platform focused on e-commerce.*

Currently, Katapult is the only major non-prime financing platform that is focused primarily online. With Katapult integrated into merchant sites, having very little competition, and open to a large market, it has lots of growth potential.

**KPLT financials**

Katapult approves around 60% of consumers who failed prime lender applications. There is higher risk when dealing with non-prime customers. Fortunately, the company has less than a 3% fraud rate and recovers around 90% of lease costs and charge-offs.

**Earnings**

In 2019, KPLT earned $92M in revenue. In 2020 they had $250M in revenue. Analysts project more gains in the upcoming years:

\-2021: $455M

\-2022: $799M

\-2023: $1,133M

KPLT earnings seem underwhelming for 2019, but we see lots of growth in 2020 and good projected growth for the upcoming years.

Another good factor contributing to KPLT growth is the indexed return on leases. In 2019, Katapult lease return improved from 28% to 35%. In 2020, it rose to 40%. Katapult’s earnings will keep growing due to its increased return on leases. The more they squeeze out of their leases, is the more profits and income they’ll net.

**Growth**

“Buy now, Pay later” transactions are gaining much more popularity. Juniper Research suggests that BNPL transactions will grow from $226B in 2021 to $995B by 2026. More than 50% of Americans use BNPL transactions as of March 2021. The BNPL market is growing at a rapid rate. With little competition among non-prime financing platforms, Katapult will skyrocket.

KPLT is expecting $1B in revenue by 2023, and is aggressively expanding its retail partners. KPLT added 26 new retail partners in Q1 and will keep growing its market.

**Conclusion**

KPLT is very, very undervalued at a little over $10. Its projected earnings are growing at a rapid rate. With KPLT greatly increasing the amount of retail partners and with the growing BNPL market, Katapult is a great investment that will have lots of return.

I think KPLT should be trading at around $20 or more. Don’t take my word on it, I’m not a financial advisor and you should definitely do some of your own DD. I hope this can bring some awareness to a criminally undervalued stock that hold lots of short and long term profits."

$PYPL

&gt;PayPal Holdings Inc.’s Venmo is making several changes to its platform, with plans to increase the fees for instant deposits that users make to their bank accounts and add an option that lets people designate that they’re paying another user for the purchase of goods and services.  
&gt;  
&gt;The moves come as PayPal [**PYPL,** **+0.48%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/PYPL?mod=MW_story_quote) [looks to turn Venmo into a bigger revenue engine](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/heres-how-paypal-hopes-to-turn-venmo-into-the-next-paypal-2020-07-31) while still trying to maintain the service’s appeal among the many younger users who rely on it to send money to their friends.  
&gt;  
&gt;Venmo plans to add a function that will let senders identify whether they’re making Venmo payments to cover the purchase of goods and services, according to a notice that began rolling out to Venmo customers this week. The change will allow users to gain purchase-protection benefits on eligible payments, though the sellers of these goods and services will start being charged 1.9% of the transaction amount, plus 10 cents, to receive money this way.  
&gt;  
&gt;It’s free for people to send or receive money through Venmo, which got its start as a way for friends and family to exchange money with one another. But Venmo is also used for business purposes, as folks like hairstylists, artists, and other sole proprietors opt to accept customer payments through the service. Venmo has been looking to capitalize on this kind of commercial activity while preserving the ability for friends to freely pay one another.

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Wednesday, June 23, 2021 **PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, June 23, 2021** 

Stocks rose again today, as inflationary concerns continue to abate, with the Nasdaq (QQQ) powering to record a new fresh intraday high driven by the continued rallies in mega-cap tech stocks like Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and Apple (AAPL). The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) continues to hover 2-3 points below its record high while the Dow Jones (DIA) continues to recover after suffering its worst performance since October 2020 last week. 

In a meeting with the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell once again reiterated that interest rates will not be raised on inflation fears alone and sees current pressures as transitory. Powell said, “We will not raise interest rates preemptively because we fear the possible onset of inflation. We will wait for evidence of actual inflation or other imbalances.” He went on to further say recent price increases “don’t speak to a broadly tight economy that would require higher interest rates” but come from factors “directly affected by the reopening”. Powell then went on to further reiterate the Central Bank is keeping a close eye on a “broad set of labor market statistics” before any adjustment to the current policy is considered. He said “We will not just look at the headline numbers for unemployment. We will look at all kinds of measures…. That is the most important thing we can do to ensure the benefits of the recovery are more fully shared”. 

As expected, response by lawmakers to Powell’s testimony, no surprise, split squarely down partisan lines, with Democrats focusing on labor market imbalances and unemployment and Republicans focusing on concerns surrounding inflation. I do not place much, if any, weight on what was said by lawmakers, just interested in what Powell had to say. 

Looking ahead, market participants are gearing up for Q2 earnings, with analysts expecting a repeat of Q1 record setting season, with earnings expected to continue being super-charged by stronger than expected demand by savings-laden consumers as the US economy is finally open to begin broadly reopening thanks to effective distribution of the vaccine.  So far, analysts are looking for S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 61.9% year-on-year in aggregate, according to FactSet data – an estimate UBS's Head of Equity Derivatives Research Stuart Kaiser said may still be ""need to be revised higher."" 

Moreover, tomorrow Thursday  the Fed is set to release the results of its “stress test” on the US largest banks, an annual test meant to test the financial health of lenders that was instituted following the 2009 financial crisis. The tests are designed to see how banks would fare during a hypothetical extreme economic downturn (not unlike what banks experienced last year). This stress test is extremely important because last year, during the height of the pandemic, the Fed imposed restrictions on banks on capital distributions like dividends and buybacks in order to ensure banks would have enough capital to weather the storm. Thanks to those measures, plus low interest rates and government stimulus that held off loan losses, analysts expect banks to perform well on Thursday, which would lead the Fed to lift remaining capital distribution curbs, opening the floodgates for banks to increase dividends and reinstitute stock buy back programs. If these restrictions are fully lifted, the six largest banks in the US - Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup, Goldman Sachs (GS), JP Morgan (JPM), Morgan Stanley (MS) and Wells Fargo (WFC) - are expected to increase payouts by $66 billion to $130 billion over the next four quarters. This is huge.

On Friday, Later this week, investors will receive the latest update on core personal consumption expenditures (PCE), which serves as the Fed's preferred gauge of inflation. The report due for release on Friday is expected to register a 3.4% year-on-year increase for May, marking the fastest jump since 1992, albeit while still reflecting ""base effects"" as prices rebound after last year's pandemic-induced collapse in prices across the board

stocks,"Why TSMC isn't the most valuable company on Earth? It just doesn't make sense for any other company to be #1. When you think about it, the economy of modern civilization is dependent on TSMC and chips only they have the tech and knowhow to make. If Apple seized to exist it would create a gap in consumer electronics and computer market but that gap would be filled in what, 6 months, a year maybe? But if Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturer closed it's door tomorrow, the world would go into a decade long recession because new chips from other factories would be inferior to TSMC made. Car makers would have to halt production or make cars worse than previous generation vehicles, tech would stop improving.  
 It's known that China is throwing money at this problem but it will take them years of poaching workforce from Taiwan and perfecting the tech to become what TSMC is today! 

When you think about it, China could make WW3 just by invading Taiwan- it's too important for USA and probably worth to start a war because of it.

stocks,"Short Squeeze Potential: AMC or GME I have recently made a good amount of money from early AMC, and I've been doing some more research on GME because it's apparently the original meme squeeze stock. 

AMC has 450m outstanding shares right now, while GME has 70M (disclosed shares I found on Google)\*. The price for AMC is nearing the price of GME, but GME just seems to have better foundations right now, so I'm confused as to why it's sitting around $200 while AMC is sitting around $60. 

GME has 1.8 billion in cash right now with zero debt to play around with, tons of future plans, and just a stronger base imo. I think AMC had 1.5 billion with a billion debt (I think I heard this on Aaron stream), is planning on eventually buying out other theatre chains, and they've given shareholders a bucket of medium popcorn (one per shareholder, not per stock). 

This is current earning though, and people are really just interested in the short squeeze coming up. Which company is more set up for the better squeeze? I've heard rumors GME owns their float multiple times over, while AMC claims they own 80% of it. Will the vote for 50m shares impact AMC at all?

I've just been wondering how hard the companies have been shorted. I look things up on Google and I can't get any information. What do y'all think? Will GME or AMC squeeze better in the long run?"

stocks,"ABCL DD - generational like company at a cheap price  **Dr. David Eifrig**

Dear *Retirement Millionaire* subscriber,

The young woman succumbed to cervical cancer in 1951... But part of her is still alive.

She spent nine months in treatment, and for the last two months, she never left Baltimore's Johns Hopkins Hospital.

She underwent radium treatments – the best technology available at the time – but it wasn't enough to stop the tenacious cancer.

When cancer researcher George Gey received a sample of her biopsy, he noticed something unusual. While most cancer cells died within a few days in laboratories, this patient's cells continued doubling every 20 to 24 hours.

#### Portfolio Snapshot

That meant that researchers could use the same cells for a series of experiments, and the supply was almost unlimited.

Dr. Gey called them HeLa cells, an anonymized contraction of the patient's name, Henrietta Lacks. Johns Hopkins offered HeLa cells freely for scientific research. And in the following decades, those cells – multiplied and divided many times – were used to develop the polio vaccine... used to study leukemia, AIDS, and cancer... and even tested in the zero gravity of space.

While Johns Hopkins gave away the cells freely, others repackaged and customized them for research, sometimes selling them for thousands of dollars per vial.

And given that these cells live on, Lacks' DNA continues to operate in living cells – 70 years later – and has contributed to countless breakthroughs, cures, and lives improved.

The story came to national fame with a 2010 bestselling book called *The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks*. It was more recently turned into a feature film starring Oprah Winfrey. And many of the beneficiaries of Lacks' amazing cells have given donations to various foundations in her name.

Lacks and her family – working-class African Americans who were living under segregation – never agreed to share her biopsy with medical researchers. It was decades before any of her survivors learned about HeLa cells. And they never received any compensation.

The medical accomplishments that resulted from HeLa cells will always suffer this tinge of Henrietta Lacks' exploitation.

But early last year, another patient donated valuable cells – knowingly, this time. Those cells were spun up into a lifesaving treatment that aided hundreds of thousands of people during the current pandemic.

Though we'll likely never know his or her name, this patient's natural immune system developed an antibody to COVID-19. It was scooped out of millions of cells in his or her bloodstream, identified, replicated, and delivered to others suffering from the respiratory disease to prevent the virus's serious symptoms.

This was made possible by an incredible new platform – from a new, recently public firm – that can change the process of discovering antibodies. Today, we'll explain why this company is so promising, and why we'll be able to get shares at a one-time discount if we buy right now.

#### Why a Platform Is Better Than a Drug

So many biotech investors bet on drugs getting through trials...

After all, that's the name of the game, isn't it? Drugs get through trials, start selling, and make money.

A biotech company with a drug that just passed trials is by definition more valuable than it was a day before, when the drug was still a gamble.

If you can find those drugs, predict approvals, and capture the surge in value, you will do well.

But catching those approvals is incredibly difficult. Even if you know the science, read all the results, and talk to experts, it's nearly impossible to know which drugs will pass trials. Even then, you have to know something the market doesn't, or share prices will already account for the likely outcomes.

We often think about it this way... The biotech companies working on the drugs have dozens of highly educated scientists who have worked on this single treatment, sometimes for decades. They know more about it than anyone in the world. *And even they don't know if it's going to pass trials*.

We have these trials precisely because we are trying to discover new information that was fundamentally unknowable until it's scientifically tested.

Rather than bet on a single drug with hugely expensive trials, we want to bet on a *platform* for discovering drugs.

We found a firm that isn't betting on a single drug... but nearly 200.

It doesn't have to fund expensive trials... but it gets paid to do its research.

And if it has a success... it can still earn big streams of drug royalties.

It's as if all the biotech companies are out searching for a needle in a haystack, and this company is selling them a giant magnet – with a right to partial ownership of any needles found.

And it had its first huge success in the depths of the pandemic...

#### A World-Class Drug in Under 90 Days

**AbCellera Biologics (Nasdaq: ABCL)** is a drug-discovery platform. It's not a pharmaceutical company itself. Rather, it helps pharma companies identify potential drugs, specifically antibodies.

We'll admit, when we started reading up on AbCellera, we were skeptical... On its website, it bills itself as a ""Full-Stack AI-Powered Antibody Discovery Platform."" Without results, that's nothing more than buzzword soup.

But it turns out the science is there.

Our immune systems design antibody proteins to attack things that shouldn't be in our bodies – like cancer cells, bacteria, or viruses. There's currently a boom in the science behind finding these antibodies when they are produced and using them to fight diseases. The market for antibodies currently tops $140 billion, and it's expected to grow to $261 billion by 2025.

But it's not easy to find them.

By full-stack, AbCellera means it can take antibody development from the first sample all the way to finding an antibody that can work as a drug. Its process starts with proprietary ""microfluidics"" that allow it to separate cells from a sample, and it goes on to artificial intelligence (""AI"") computer-vision technology that can look at proteins and judge whether they may be a viable antibody.

This process saved lives in 2020.

AbCellera knew that the urgency of COVID-19 would make a great use of its technology, and it entered a partnership with Eli Lilly (LLY) to develop a SARS-CoV-2 antibody.

In February 2020, on what we'll count as ""Day Zero,"" AbCellera received a sample from one of the first U.S. patients to get COVID-19. That patient is our new Henrietta Lacks... because his or her antibodies ended up treating hundreds of thousands of people.

AbCellera used its advanced microfluidics system to isolate and screen 5.8 million cells from that sample. (This is the haystack we are looking in.) This is not easy. But AbCellera's technology allows researchers to use a device the size of a credit card with more than a half-million miniature chambers to separate cells.

Then the company identified 2,200 candidates that looked like spike-protein antibodies and eventually got 500 monoclonal antibodies out of that.

We're already down to less than 0.008% of the cells from the original sample. But at 500 candidates, that's still too many drugs to test.

That's where AbCellera's image-recognition AI came in. The system analyzed those 500 candidates and isolated 24 that were worthy of human testing. Those candidates got sent off to Eli Lilly.

From sample to delivery to Eli Lilly, AbCellera took only 23 days. That's simply a mind-blowing number.

Eli Lilly needed less than two months to take AbCellera's candidates into human trials. And what came out of it was a drug called bamlanivimab. It was approved in 15 countries and treated more than 400,000 COVID patients.

The drug brought Eli Lilly $871 million in revenue in the fourth quarter of 2020 alone. (Now Eli Lilly pairs bamlanivimab with another antibody for a more potent treatment.)

The most recent study tests the combination of bamlanivimab with another antibody and shows that high-risk patients saw an 87% reduction in hospitalizations and deaths. The study of 511 patients treated saw *zero* deaths, compared with 13 deaths in the 258 treated with a placebo.

With COVID-19 treatment getting better in general and vaccinations on the rise, it's likely that bamlanivimab sales will ease off. While it was a great financial success for AbCellera, the drug probably won't be part of its long-term future.

That's fine with us. AbCellera is currently working on more than 100 projects with major partners.

When investing in biotech stocks, the biggest question is whether the promised technology is a viable product or just a scientist's wishful thinking.

Bamlanivimab is the first drug to go through AbCellera's full process... so as of right now, its success rate is 100%.

If AbCellera's platform can repeatedly find those needles in the haystack, it's going to be a huge success. Fortunately, we've found compelling evidence that it can replicate this success...

#### Some Votes in Its Favor

One of the most striking signs of potential success for AbCellera is its list of partners.

It has ongoing development projects with a stellar list of big-time, successful pharma companies and organizations. In addition to Eli Lilly, these include...

* Gilead Sciences (GILD)
* Novartis (NVS)
* GlaxoSmithKline (GSK)
* Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (TEVA)
* Sanofi (SNY)
* Pfizer (PFE)
* Merck (MRK)
* Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN)
* Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (""DARPA"")
* Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation

AbCellera now has 119 projects under development – up 63% from last year. It's working with skilled drug developers. While they are well-versed in taking risks to develop drugs, they also have the experience and know-how to determine what technologies stand a good chance of helping them.

The science itself also offers clues to success.

For one, you can pluck natural antibodies from the immune system like AbCellera does, or you can attempt to create them from scratch. The natural way works best, with 92% of approved antibody drugs coming from natural immune systems.

To further the success of the COVID-19 antibody, AbCellera found another antibody, called LY-CoV1404, that may work better against more variants of the virus. The company announced in May it was headed to clinical trials.

But perhaps the biggest clue comes from the roster of investors we'll be sitting alongside...

#### The Smartest Guys in the Room

Biotech investing is hard, but specialists can earn incredible returns. And those specialists can help you find the best places to invest.

We've found that the best investors love AbCellera.

The top biotech investors in the world are Julian and Felix Baker, who run Baker Bros. Advisors.

As of a 2019 profile in Bloomberg, they had amassed $3.8 billion in personal wealth, almost entirely from biotech investing. The fund they ran had grown to $17 billion. They've had huge, multibillion-dollar gains in companies like Seagen (SGEN), also known as Seattle Genetics, and BeiGene (BGNE).

As the CEO of one of its investments explained, ""You come out of your first meeting with them, you go 'wow' and you're drenched in sweat. Not every investor is so well-prepared.""

Another fund called OrbiMed Advisors does nearly as well and is perennially listed in the top biotech venture capital firms. The public, London-listed Biotech Growth Trust (BIOG.L) it manages (which is separate from its main funds) has returned 1,200% over the past 15 years, versus 832% for biotech firms in general and just 137% for the overall U.K. stock market.

While not specializing in biotech, Peter Thiel is an outspoken and independent billionaire who dominates Silicon Valley. He got rich as a co-founder of PayPal and then moved on to be an early investor in other now-famous ventures like Facebook, SpaceX, and Spotify.

*All* of these guys are early – and sizable – investors in AbCellera. In many cases, it makes up an outsized investment in their funds. (Another legendary biotech fund, Perceptive Advisors, was an early investor as well.)

And while many biotech firms can claim one of these storied investors, not many have attracted capital from all three.

Here's what we think when we see these investors...

First, they are smart. They know biotech. They know what works and what doesn't, and they know what businesses can step in and fill the gaps that other biotechnology companies can use. If they think AbCellera has a future, so do we.

Furthermore, given their connections, they can help to introduce their other portfolio holdings to AbCellera's platform – providing a source of new customers.

#### What Royalty Streams Can Mean

AbCellera gets paid in a few ways...

It gets payments up front when it partners with a drug company, and then milestone payments as it delivers antibody candidates or as drug trials complete. These payments are great for keeping the research proceeding and lowering AbCellera's risk.

But the biggest riches will come from the royalty stake that AbCellera retains in any drugs that come to market.

The terms of the deals are not disclosed, but by comparing the bamlanivimab results reported by Eli Lilly and AbCellera, it looks like AbCellera collected something like 15% or 20%.

If AbCellera can work on 119 (and counting) projects and take 20% from them, those streams are going to start stacking up on each other in a big way.

We don't know how successful the platform will be in the long run, but let's say it has a 10% success rate. (To be clear, we're expecting much higher.) Then let's also say that the drugs it finds are about half as successful, financially, as bamlanivimab and earn $500 million per year.

That would put the future revenue on its current batch of projects at $4 billion per year. The stocks in the Nasdaq Biotech Index are currently valued at 7.7 times sales, which would put AbCellera at a market cap of $30 billion, an increase of more than 300% from today's $6.8 billion.

We're only painting a rough outline, but the point is to demonstrate that the effect of cumulative royalties could turn out to be massive. We'd much rather own 15% to 20% of 119 projects than 100% of one or two drugs in trials.

#### By the Numbers

While the science will determine AbCellera's success, we'll still review the financials.

Prior to the successful commercialization of bamlanivimab, the company had little income. But in the last two quarters, AbCellera brought in $200 million in sales per quarter, up from $4.7 million in the first quarter of 2020.

That makes for a huge $105 million in cash flow in the most recent quarter.

But it won't hold up. Analysts expect sales to fall off dramatically. Fortunately, AbCellera's cash burn is sustainable. Most of its expenses come attached to certain projects and are funded by specific payments from partners. The company has a huge $686 million in cash on hand, which can fund years of operations.

Currently valued at about $6.8 billion, it certainly sports a hefty price for a firm that's still mostly a speculative bet on what it can do in the future. At the same time, it has created an incredible amount of value since it was founded in 2012. With a little more success, excitement can ramp up still further for this startup.

#### Why Today Is the Perfect Day to Buy AbCellera

On the heels of its success developing bamlanivimab, AbCellera went public via an initial public offering (""IPO"") in December.

The company sold 27.7 million shares and raised $555 million to fund the development of the business.

And those big-name early investors we mentioned earlier are sitting on hundreds of millions of dollars in publicly traded shares.

However, they couldn't sell. IPOs typically come with a ""lock-up period,"" an agreement made by certain early investors that they won't sell their shares for a specified period of time after the offering. This is supposed to give new investors confidence that early investors won't dump their shares and send down the price during the first few important months the stock trades.

The lock-up for AbCellera expired today, June 9. Insiders can now sell.

Common wisdom suggests you don't want to own shares of an IPO as the lock-up expires, since some early investors will undoubtedly sell shares and put downward pressure on the price.

However, a careful study of IPO results shows that on average, stocks decline *until* the lock-up day, then start to trade up after that. It appears that the market anticipates the end of lock-up, but by the time insiders can sell, shares are ready to rise again.

And shares dipped down sharply as the lock-up approached...

📷

That makes June 10, the day after lock-up, the perfect day to buy AbCellera.

Of course, we can't be certain that AbCellera will follow the same pattern precisely. Shares could decline for any number of reasons, insider selling included. However, we're looking at this as long-term investors with a bit of short-term evidence on our side.

Also, to be clear, you can't time any investment precisely. While June 10 is *statistically* the best time to buy, you don't have to rush out and buy this second. Any time in June, or even any time this year, should be a great time to buy AbCellera. But it never hurts to carefully study the history.

What we'll be watching closer is... what do those early investors we like to follow do? We see it as likely that Baker Bros., OrbiMed, and Peter Thiel will sell shares in the coming months. And their selling may push the share price down in the short term – but what does it mean for the long term?

Investors have a lot of reasons to sell that have nothing to do with the prospects of AbCellera. These guys put in a little money that turned into a lot of money. It's only natural to take profits.

Besides, given AbCellera's huge growth, it's an oversized position in many of their portfolios.

If these investors decide to pare down their holdings to be in line with the rest of their portfolios, that would be a reasonable decision even if they want to hold on for continued gains.

If these investors take the first opportunity to sell their positions to zero and get out of the company completely, we'd be less encouraged. But we'd be shocked if it happened.

Most of these investors need to report their buying and selling activities on a quarterly basis, with reports on the quarter ending June 30 due on August 16. And Thiel has to file a report within two days of any transactions. We'll report back on any important news from their filings.

But whatever the big investors do, they've already pointed us to a biotech startup with outstanding prospects and technology that seems like a sci-fi dream.

In a best-case scenario, if its platform continues to work as well as it did on COVID-19 antibodies, this little-known startup could be one of the world's biggest biotech firms.

If it only works half that well, it will still be worth multiple times its current value.

We'll name this as one of our rare speculations in *Retirement Millionaire*. We tend to be conservative with our capital, but taking a more aggressive position when the facts warrant it is what turns your portfolio from a stalwart to a star. We think AbCellera can bring us those returns."

stocks,"CLNE - A very promising long term stock Hello people of r/stocks! Recently there has been a push to promote CLNE on WSB but I think the members of this community should be our targets. I’ve been seeing so many people say CLNE “to the moon” or stress about one bad day of trading and if you’re looking for the “next” AMC you’re not being realistic by buying into CLNE. This is a company that is still trying to build its infrastructure, and major changes like converting freight from diesel to RNG will take time. I am very optimistic about this stock though due to the Amazon warrant and previous stocks that had warrants executed under this circumstance.


I’m a certified idiot so take all of this information with that in mind but three companies that Amazon previously executed warrants for make me believe the growth potential for this could be very enticing in the long term.


KRNT had a warrant price of $13.03 and it’s value as I type this is $119

PLUG had a $1.20 warrant and at the time of execution it was valued at $60(now at $34.25)

ATSG had a warrant for $9.73 and at the time of execution it was at $30(now at $23.24)


With CLNE’s warrant being at $13.49 and Amazon’s investment track record I’m feeling very comfortable just buying and holding as the company continues to develop it’s infrastructure and I think anyone that is looking for long term gains should do some research into this stock.

TLDR: CLNE is an undervalued stock that in my opinion is a buy and HODL. It has been making big pushes to solidify its infrastructure and has added valuable partners in Amazon and BP.


I am not a financial adviser and take this post with that discretion in mind. 

From what I saw in the rules I need to add this? Currently holding 527 shares of CLNE as well as some options(07/16 and 12/17)"

But what internet gives you is information for your research! You need to learn how to filter the signal from the noise.

How are whales, institutions and pro traders successful? Because their strategy is based on information/metrics, including social media sentiment. Filtering out signal from noise is fundamental to having a sustainable long-term strategy.

Noise - Stupid meme posts without any research. Everyone saying we don't know shit about fuck to farm votes.

Signal - Whales buying bigger than ever since January, Lightning network going parabolic, countries competing to attract miners from China, price action matching the middle part of 2013 and 2017 bull cycles, Fibonacci golden ratio, last big batch of GBTC unlock ended yesterday, retail selling. 

Retail just follows some famous person's opinion who is using influence to manipulate them and usually the words and actions don't match at all, so retail will forever get fucked. I guess they say ignorance is bliss because it's an easy way to get fucked!

If you want to go to the other side. Learn to study the metrics whales do and learn what matters and what doesn't matter by backtesting your models.

I understand others may have different positions - I would love to hear what you are all doing to maximize this current stage in the market. This is not financial advice...

Target Coins

* BTC 30%
* ETH 30%
* ADA 5%
* ALGO 5%
* ATOM 5%
* XTZ 5%
* DOT 5%
* VET 5%
* LTC 5%
* DASH 5%
* BAT
* XLM

Intro strategy

I have had a small bag all coins listed and a few more before the recent ATH correction. The first thing I did was to sell out of projects that I was not truly behind, and everything I did not truly understand/see a use case for. When I saw prices that were decent (one of the first dips to 29/30k) I took the extra cash and then some to re-invest in the above list. This gives me a lower/good cost average for my coins moving forward.

Exchange info

I use Binance US only for VET. I have only used them for about a year, so I don't have as much trust with this exchange, but have had no bad experiences. Moderate fees, funds hold 10 days before withdraw from ACH deposit, allows access to shitcoins (LOL). I use Uphold for the sole purpose of BAT. It is the wallet accepted by the Brave Brower, which rewards free BAT monthly for receiving ads. I would change this immediately if I could, not a fan. I have used Coinbase and Coinbase Pro since 2017, and this is where I buy most crypto. I feel its important to explain why I use CB, because it has been very helpful in the process.

* Trust (Old exchange, SEC regulated stock)
* Earn (I have earned over $50 worth of crypto for free)
* Instant transfer deposits (from ACH, to Coinbase - not CB Pro. Allows immediate transfer of funds)
* Low/no cost conversions (Coinbase allows converting from crypto to crypto. I have never noticed a loss in dollar value after a conversion. Converting to stable coins does not apply, as there is a trading fee)
* CB Card (I deposit spending money in USDC, spend and earn 4% back in XLM)
* In house staking (Initially I used this more, but I chose to move all but ETH to wallets)
* App layout, crypto markets/information (between CB and CB Pro there are many ways to analyze charts, markets, and research coins.)
* Instant transfer between CB/CB Pro
* CB Pro ordering functions (lower market order fees starting at .5%, decreasing as volume increases monthly. Limit orders are even less. Access to limit buys and sells is important)

Investing strategy

I earn income weekly, so I have an amount set aside that I set up a recurring deposit to Coinbase (USDC). There is no fee, and I actually earned $5 for setting it up. 100% of this is transferred to CB Pro, instantly, for free. It is then converted to USD, where 50% is placed in market orders, as split in the coin breakdown above.

The other 50% is placed on limit orders. I take a look at the charts and find the 14-28 day low average for each coin, and this is my starting point for the first order. The second order will be placed at a percentage loss from that starting point, and the third will be placed at a percentage loss from the second order. I chose -15% for BTC and ETH, and -20% for all others listed. Example - BTC starting point/1st limit order $30500. 2nd limit order is -15% so $25925. 3rd limit order is -15% again so 22036. If the limit orders don't trigger, I simply add more to the order the next DCA, strengthening my purchasing power for the correction. If the orders trigger, the process starts again with the next deposit.

BAT and XLM are earned through Brave browser and CB Card, respectively. I do take seperate funds and deposit USDC for the sole purpose of having USDC to spend and earn XLM on my daily purchases and bills. I leave the BAT in Uphold due to fees but transfer the XLM to Celsius to gain interest. As you will see, the next part of the ""investing"" is actually earning crypto by staking/holding.

Wallet info

I am getting tired so I'll speed it up. Although most vets would recommend them, I have yet to purchase a hardware wallet. I feel secure with my amount of crypto with my wallets and exchanges security. 2FA, passphrases, whitelisting, etc. have given me security for years. I'll just list what I use and why.

* Celsius (BTC/DASH/XLM) - not my own ""wallet"" technically but has layers of security. The risk is in the company, whom I try to keep tabs on. you receive 6.2% APY on BTC, 4.6% on DASH and 3.1% on XLM. Free withdraws. DASH and BTC have relatively low transfer fees so not much is lost on the way in. XLM has 0 fees!
* Blockfi (LTC) - See Celsius description but 4.5% on LTC, with low transfer in and 1 free withdraw a month. Admittedly I am less favorable of their operations.
* Coinbase (ETH) - It has high costs to transfer ETH and its tokens, so I choose not to. I lock in the ETH on CB for 5% APY.
* Yoroi &amp; Daedalus (ADA) - Native wallets for ADA. I split my ADA in these two wallets with different staking pools. Easy to operate after researching.
* ALGO Wallet (ALGO) - Native wallet of ALGO. Smooth interface, easy to operate with automatic staking.
* Cosmostation (ATOM) - Native wallet of ATOM. Smooth interface, easy to operate with automatic staking.
* Magma (XTZ) - Native wallet of XTZ. Smooth, easy to operate after researching.
* PolkaWallet (DOT) - Native wallet of XTZ. Smooth, easy to operate after researching.
* VeChainThor (VET) - Native wallet of ATOM. Smooth interface, easy to operate with automatic staking. (Earns VTHO)

It may not be perfect, but I hope this helps someone out. Feel free to ask questions. Thanks for reading!"

Intro strategy

I have had a small bag all coins listed and a few more before the recent ATH correction. The first thing I did to do was get out of projects that I was not truly behind, and everything I did not truly understand/see a use case for. When I saw prices that were decent (one of the first dips to 29/30k) I took the extra cash and then some to re-invest in the above list. This gives me a lower/good cost average for my coins moving forward.

&amp;#x200B;

Exchange info

I use Binance US only for VET. I have only used them for about a year, so I don't have as much trust with this exchange, but have had no bad experiences. Moderate fees, funds hold 10 days before withdraw from ACH deposit, allows access to shitcoins (LOL). I use Uphold for the sole purpose of BAT. It is the wallet accepted by the Brave Brower, which rewards free BAT monthly for receiving ads. I would change this immediately if I could, not a fan. I have used Coinbase and Coinbase Pro since 2017, and this is where I buy most crypto. I feel its important to explain why I use CB, because it has been very helpful in the process.

* Trust (Old exchange, SEC regulated stock)
* Earn (I have earned over $50 worth of crypto for free)
* Instant transfer deposits (from ACH, to Coinbase - not CB Pro. Allows immediate transfer of funds)
* Low/no cost conversions (Coinbase allows converting from crypto to crypto. I have never noticed a loss in dollar value after a conversion. Converting to stable coins does not apply, as there is a trading fee)
* CB Card (I deposit spending money in USDC, spend and earn 4% back in XLM)
* In house staking (Initially I used this more, but I chose to move all but ETH to wallets)
* App layout, crypto markets/information (between CB and CB Pro there are many ways to analyze charts, markets, and research coins.)
* Instant transfer between CB/CB Pro
* CB Pro ordering functions (lower market order fees starting at .5%, decreasing as volume increases monthly. Limit orders are even less. Access to limit buys and sells is important)

&amp;#x200B;

Investing strategy

I earn income weekly, so I have an amount set aside that I set up a recurring deposit to Coinbase (USDC). There is no fee, and I actually earned $5 for setting it up. 100% of this is transferred to CB Pro, instantly, for free. It is then converted to USD, where 50% is placed in market orders, as split in the coin breakdown above.

The other 50% is placed on limit orders. I take a look at the charts and find the 14-28 day low average for each coin, and this is my starting point for the first order. The second order will be placed at a percentage loss from that starting point, and the third will be placed at a percentage loss from the second order. I chose -15% for BTC and ETH, and -20% for all others listed. Example - BTC starting point/1st limit order $30500. 2nd limit order is -15% so $25925. 3rd limit order is -15% again so 22036. If the limit orders don't trigger, I simply add more to the order the next DCA, strengthening my purchasing power for the correction. If the orders trigger, the process starts again with the next deposit. 

BAT and XLM are earned through Brave browser and CB Card, respectively. I do take seperate funds and deposit USDC for the sole purpose of having USDC to spend and earn XLM on my daily purchases and bills. I leave the BAT in Uphold due to fees but transfer the XLM to Celsius to gain interest. As you will see, the next part of the ""investing"" is actually earning crypto by staking/holding. 

&amp;#x200B;

Wallet info

I am getting tired so I'll speed it up. Although most vets would recommend them, I have yet to purchase a hardware wallet. I feel secure with my amount of crypto with my wallets and exchanges security. 2FA, passphrases, whitelisting, etc. have given me security for years. I'll just list what I use and why.

* Celsius (BTC/DASH/XLM) - not my own ""wallet"" technically but has layers of security. The risk is in the company, whom I try to keep tabs on. you receive 6.2% APY on BTC, 4.6% on DASH and 3.1% on XLM. Free withdraws. DASH and BTC have relatively low transfer fees so not much is lost on the way in. XLM has 0 fees!
* Blockfi (LTC) - See Celsius description but 4.5% on LTC, with low transfer in and 1 free withdraw a month. Admittedly I am less favorable of their operations.
* Coinbase (ETH) - It has high costs to transfer ETH and its tokens, so I choose not to. I lock in the ETH on CB for 5% APY.
* Yoroi &amp; Daedalus (ADA) - Native wallets for ADA. I split my ADA in these two wallets with different staking pools. Easy to operate after researching.
* ALGO Wallet (ALGO) - Native wallet of ALGO. Smooth interface, easy to operate with automatic staking.
* Cosmostation (ATOM) - Native wallet of ATOM. Smooth interface, easy to operate with automatic staking.
* Magma (XTZ) - Native wallet of XTZ. Smooth, easy to operate after researching.
* PolkaWallet (DOT) - Native wallet of XTZ. Smooth, easy to operate after researching.
* VeChainThor (VET) - Native wallet of ATOM. Smooth interface, easy to operate with automatic staking. (Earns VTHO)

CryptoCurrency,"Why HODL may be a better strategy than you thought Literally no person has ever lost money holding BTC for more than 3.5 years - even if they bought at the absolute tops of the market.  Price has never receded lower than prior cycle's high.

This is why BTC is parroted as the number one coin a new investor should hold. It's still one of the safest bets overall for high growth. 

Unless you're an knowledgeable investor who understands things like market cap, initial coin distributions, inflation rates, actual use cases, programming language used, etc... I'd stay away from anything outside the top two big boys. Most of the market is way too speculative and small caps get manipulated a lot easier.

Gambling at a casino is almost always a losing proposition, but HODLing BTC and maybe ETH is like you being the house instead of the chumps throwing money around.

And it's buying the dip in the bull run  
When it gets there it knows, if the markets are closed  
With a tweet it can get what it died for  
Ooh, ooh, and it's buying the dip in the bull run

There's a sign in the charts, but it wants to be sure  
'Cause you know sometimes tweets have two meanings  
In a tweet by the news, there's a whaleboat that blows  
Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven  
You know

There's a feeling I get when I look to the charts  
And my spirit is crying for selling  
In my thoughts I've seen candles of green through the red  
And the buy ins of those who stand watching  
That's you

And it's whispered that soon, if we all call the bluff  
Then the market will lead us to reason  
And a new day will dawn for those who stand long  
And the markets will echo with laughter  
Remember laughter?

Oh yeah, yeah, yeah...

And it makes me wonder  
If there's a bustle in your hedgefund, don't be alarmed now  
It's just a spring clean for the May queen  
Yes, there are two trends you can go by, but in the long run  
There's still time to change the path you're on

Your fiat is humming and it won't go, in case you don't know  
The market's calling you to join it  
Dear buyer, can you time the bull run, and did you know  
Your future lies on the investor's whim?

And as we HODL on down the chart  
Our wallets taller than our debt  
There trends a market we all know  
That shines green light and wants to show  
How everything still turns to gold

And if you listen very hard  
The tune will come to you at last  
When all is one and one is crypto, that's what it is  
To be a HODL and not to fold, oh yeah

And it's buying the dip in the bull run"

I'll start this by acknowledging that manipulation does exist and it is even more rampant than the stock market due to crypto's unregulated nature. And I will admit there's something re assuring to look at Wyckoff charts expecting another pump.

However...

According to most YouTubers and traders and sentiment peddlers in this space, there seems to be a secret group of 'they' who move as if possessing a singular will in well rehearsed cadences.

From game theory perspective, this assumption is false.

Most whales and institutions have their own priorities and interest, and those groups are just as likely to compete against one another as they're likely to cooperate. Fact is, we can't know for sure. So it's nonsensical to think that whenever you lose money there must be some kind of high powers that are behind it, hell bent on reducing your holdings to zero. I've seen it all. I've seen Asians blaming the Westerners for 'selling' and I've seen the Westerners blaming the Asians for 'dumping'.

CryptoCurrency,"Wired: Forget Dogecoin, the future of crypto is DeFi [https://www.wired.co.uk/article/bitcoin-square-defi-ethereum](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/bitcoin-square-defi-ethereum)

In recent years, DeFi has emerged as one of the most consequential developments reshaping the cryptocurrency world. Rather than bitcoin, its ascension has been tightly linked to Ethereum, the world’s second cryptocurrency, whose decentralised network – or blockchain – allows for the provision of services and the execution of more complex tasks than just sending and receiving payments.

For sure, as cryptocurrency grows increasingly institutionalised, DeFi remains one of the last redoubts of crypto’s early decentralised yen. And that, paradoxically, is still worrying the big players. A few months ahead of its $86bn IPO, in June 2021, cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase [groused in a SEC filing](https://www.coindesk.com/coinbase-defi-us-regulations-dex-competition), “we do face significant competition from parties ranging from large, established financial incumbents to smaller, early stage financial technology providers and companies native to the cryptoeconomy, such as decentralised exchanges.”"

Because right now I figured I may as well play it safe and do any of my interest passive income making on NEXO. It feels more secure and the insurance really does ease any concerns I may have about it. But the APY is around 12% max.

I’m assuming the benefit is that I get to keep my coins? For example, I don’t have to switch ETH or LINK to NEXO to earn interest... but on Pancakeswap I’d need to exchange any assets I have for CAKE in order to stake it? Is that the catch?

CryptoCurrency,"Social Networks as Exchanges (Snax)- The future of exchanges Social Networks as Exchanges (Snax)- The future


The enemy of cryptocurrencies is centralization. Therefore, the way to strengthen exchanges is to decentralize them. Instead of relying on a few exchanges, there should be hundreds of thousands of exchanges. If there were hundreds of thousands of people independently buying and selling codes- cryptocurrencies-, strings of numbers and letters, across the globe, there wouldn’t be a single point of failure. 


I imagine in the very near future, buyers and sellers of cryptos can establish small relationships based on their social media profile, their phone number, or a meet-up. My local division of motor vehicles uses an ingenious identity system for public identity instead of using people’s names. Their system uses just the last four digits of your 10-digit phone number. 

# Last Four Explained

By using the last four digits in a trade, the only people who would know the full phone number would be the buyer and seller. Each party would be able to see the reviews by the last four digits prior to engaging in the trade. The buyer would contact the seller, or visa-versa, and the trade could be initiated once both parties have confirmed the last four of the phone numbers match with the four posted online. 


In this scenario, both parties are vulnerable. Each has the other’s full phone number. Therefore, it will be in the interests of both parties to behave responsibly. The phone number scheme is just an example of how reputation can be established across all social media platforms and will make exchanging crypto-currency for fiat much easier and more decentralized. A trade ad in the following manner can appear on any social media platform:
    
    [buying] up to 0.5 bitcoin cashapp, zelle, youtube (***)-***-0123                                                                        
    
    [selling] up to 0.5 bitcoin cashapp (***)-***-5869


The tools to accomplish this are widely available. There are review systems in place to be used to record your interaction with a buyer or seller. You can provide positive reviews and negative reviews of trades. It would be about reputations and grades.Trades can be made across any region as long as there is some form of trust and reputation. Trades can be made over the phone, via emails, in person, or drop locations. 


With prevalent services such as paypal, zelle, and cashapp, cash can easily be sent among trusted parties. The trust comes from reviews and past trades. Being that cryptocurrency addresses and wallets are nothing more than words and numbers, these transactions would be protected by freedom of speech. 

#Be Careful

One word of advice is still to use common sense when trading. It is better to make several small trades instead of one big trade. This applies especially when trading with someone new or untrusted. Regardless of how good the deal may seem, go with small amounts at first. There is nothing worse than sending someone your cryptocurrency and not receiving anything in return. It is like a kick to the gut. It is better to lose a small amount than a large amount of coins. 


Hopefully you won’t be scammed, but if you are, please provide appropriate feedback for the scammer to let others know of the danger. Do your part to prevent this from happening to anyone else."

CryptoCurrency,"I think the economics of Axie Infinity is a massive ponzi scheme waiting to burst (detailed post). What have I got wrong?  Atm it costs about $1k to buy 3 axies &amp; play. No one pays this much just coz it's fun, for any of this level of sophistication. All the new players are coming in to earn money, which comes from new players coming in after them, buying axies they breed. How is this NOT a ponzi scheme? Or am I missing anything?

My price target for one axie is $5-10 USD (similar as the cheapest cryptokitties, or about the price people are actually willing to pay to play just for fun. So about 95-98% down from current level. This could be painful for a lot of Filipinos doing this full time?

Don't get me wrong - I would love to see ppl from developing countries get hold of new tech-enabled opportunities but, when something seems too good to be true, it usually is.

The thing about societal disruption is this - it is sustainable as long as it successfully channels resources (like computing power or human labour) into something that society values &amp; rewards financially. Using electricity to secure a payments blockchain is a good example.

Creating new types of online jobs like developers for blockchain projects or even VAs for companies in developed countries is another good example, that works and is sustainable.

Channelling human labour into playing a game as a form of economic activity in itself is NOT sustainable, unless it generates value outside the game. The market rewards this only in the short run (as the bubble grows), with the pop being inevitable, once there is no new $$$ flooding in.

If the model is for everyone to make money by playing, where is this money coming from? In reality, it has to be a zero-sum game.

I'm not saying the game itself is not good but the economic model seems very flawed. I think mindlessly promoting it as a messiah for the developing world is a very dangerous bubble behaviour, as this can and will backfire viscously.

i might be wrong (please tell me where?) but I am not new to the crypto space and have spent a lot of time reviewing tokenomics of many projects. Hope this starts a discussion."

2. Nobody gives a shit about your opinion

3. Cryptos are gunna grow and grow and we’ll all be fine

4. You don’t know what you’re talking about

CryptoCurrency,Name for me one good coin or token with a CEO or any Chief Seriously what kind of an idiot would a person need to be to self proclaim as a CEO of a crypto????  You do know that any organization and or structure around said crypto instantly becomes a human attack vector.  This attack vector can be used by government regulators and or any thing else.  The SEC for example would look at such organization as additional proof that said crypto is a security of the corporation ( vs a partnership).  So I submit to you that I would like to see an example of a good coin or token that has a ceo or any chief.
CryptoCurrency,"How to buy/sell/trade Moons right now. Everyone here should know that it is possible to trade Moons on at least these two example websites.

Anyone can trade Moons for  Nano (or vice versa) on Kuyumcu's website moon.nano.trade/

Alternatively you can trade their Moons against Lumens (XLM) using the website https://celesti.trade/

Once you have Nano or Lumens (XLM) you can transfer it to or from any exchange that supports the related coin. So you can both buy more moons or sell Moons when your ready to cash out.

Nano has ZERO transfer fees. Same is basically true for XLM, if there are fees they aren't noticeable.

If a transaction doesn't go through within an hour's time, email the email address on the website. Include your  nano or XLM address and your Rinkerby Ethereum address found in your reddit mobile app.

I believe Moons, like many cryptos, may see a possible price swings as future development changes the community's speculation for the coin."

CryptoCurrency,"What am I missing? It seems the way DeFi is currently set up it could potentially take down the entire crypto market. The whole ecosystem is over-leveraged, dependent on constant liquidity and rising token values. If that liquidity dries up, or the collateral value drops, it's game over. I'm not trying to be a doomer or just spread FUD, but I've been doing a lot of research on DeFi recently and don't really see any other way to interpret this.  I know I'm not the first to notice how fucked the current situation seems. As far as I can tell, the DeFi ecosystem has built itself into a giant house of cards, propped up by hopes &amp; dreams at this point.

Getting a picture of the entirety of DeFi is kind of complicated (I definitely don't understand it all), but for the sake of this post, DeFi i'm referring to is the series of applications developed to enable various ""decentralized"" financial functions on the blockchain.  

The 2 most popular functions being Crytpo Lending/Borrowing and Decentralized exchanges (DEXs)

Crypto holders are incentivized to participate in DeFi as a means of ""Yield Farming"". Basically, parking crypto assets into a liquidity pool so it can earn interest and fees, paid out in the form of an app-specific token.  Sometimes the annual interest returns are huge.

Cypto borrowers get a great deal through these apps too. Put up some coins as collateral, and in return you get instant access to liquidity. No credit checks, no applications... all automated. 

There is a lot of opaqueness in the DeFi market and like I said, I don't fully understand it all. What I understand for sure is:

1. DeFi depends on a consistent stream of incoming liquidity
2. DeFi also depends on the volume of transactions on the network (to collect fees)
3. The price stability of tokens on DeFi apps rely on arbitrage traders (a lot of this in the form of bots)
4. People who get into DeFi projects early see much higher returns. As returns drop, they move their liquidity elsewhere.

All fine in a controlled environment. But here's where I see it going all wrong.   
As the crypto market heated up in 2020, money began flooding into DeFi applications.  Since DeFi allows traders to leverage their assets to make bigger transactions...this in turn helped prop up the entire crypto market with a surge of new liquidity.  After all, all of those tokens previously sitting idle in people's wallets were now being put to work. 

The amount of value just locked into DeFi is now astronomical, currently somewhere over $66 Billion (down from a peak of almost $100 billion).  

But as the DeFi world started to heat up, more and more dApps came into the fold promising increasing interest and rewards. Interest rates in these pools are almost always higher when the coin or token supply is low and demand is high....as more people rush to participate, the yield returns typically drop.  

So we saw Yield Farmers getting increasingly sophisticated. To maximize rewards, many lenders would run their tokens between different pools chasing the highest returns. 

Yield farmers also would then re-invest the tokens received from one liquidity pool, into separate liquidity pools on other dApps for THAT token.  Creating complicated daisy chains of returns. 

To stretch things even thinner...many yield farmers would use their yields as collateral to BORROW more assets, then invest those in liquidity pools, to further increase their returns.

The economics behind this are pretty mind-numbing. Its akin to the mortgage backed securities situation in 2008. Basically....tons of collateralized ""junk"" assets are being traded, all based off a pool of inherently risky &amp; volatile crypto assets.  Remember, the market for these tokens only exists on DeFi.

Honestly its hard to wrap my head around. But I do know all of it depends on new liquidity and volume coming into the systems, and the value of the underlying tokens remains stable or growing.

So the big glaring question is....what the heck happens when the liquidity dries up or the value of the tokens drop off a cliff?

We've already seen multiple times how a dApp can have a meltdown.

* In Mar 2020, we saw the MakerDAO liquidity crisis . Basically, ETH price dropped...people rushed to  stablecoin DAI, and the app also triggered automatic liquidations (which malfunctioned). This caused a huge shortage of DAI on the system, and people to lose out big time.  [https://www.coindesk.com/makerdao-adds-usdc-as-defi-collateral-following-black-thursday-chaos](https://www.coindesk.com/makerdao-adds-usdc-as-defi-collateral-following-black-thursday-chaos)
* Later in Sept. 2020 we saw the SushiSwap rug pull. Long story short...a billion dollars flooded into SushiSwap DEX...then the developer pulls out all of his liquidity suddenly. The underlying token value plummeted...but so did the price of Etherium (by 30%+), and subsequently bitcoin. 
* Then last month we saw the IRON/TITAN ""bank run"".... investors tried to redeem their stablecoins and sell the asset, leading to a massive selloff that tanked the token price to $0 [https://www.coindesk.com/iron-finance-says-it-suffered-cryptos-first-large-scale-bank-run-in-token-crash-postmortem](https://www.coindesk.com/iron-finance-says-it-suffered-cryptos-first-large-scale-bank-run-in-token-crash-postmortem)

So we already know potential consequences that can happen.   
 **1) bank runs on DeFi tokens are possible.**   
 **2)  A sharp drop in the value of any of the assets in a liquidity pool can lead to mass liquidations,**  
**3) When the value of DeFi tokens plummet suddenly, it takes the ""mainstream"" crypto market down with it**  
**4) All of this also has the potential to unpeg stablecoins**

As far as I can tell, all it would take is for the underlying crypto asset price of Etherium or Bitcoin to crash low enough to trigger mass liquidations. Suddenly, you're left with a huge flight of liquidity, and tons of ""empty"" token pairs. As traders rush to get their tokens exchanged for ""safer"" assets, the liquidity pools are drained, and gas prices skyrocket. These combined effects could in-turn shut down the entire arbitrage and liquidation markets...all resulting in complete price instability. 

It would cause a catastrophic ripple effect throughout the entire market.  Once all of that leveraged lending goes away, and thousands of coins are unlocked/ sold onto the open market, it will be apocalyptic for crypto prices.  

Whether individual projects are ""good"" and some are ""bad"", doesn't really matter in this case. They've pretty much all been linked together in some way. If the biggest domino falls at the top, the rest come with it. 

Tbh, its kind of horrifying. 

**TL;DR:** The current DeFi ecosystem seems like the 2008 mortgage crisis, Bernie Madoff ponzi scheme, and Amway all rolled into one...and its going to collapse when the price of Bitcoin / Etherium drop too low. Only this time, there's not going to be a bailout. Am I reading into this wrong?"

CryptoCurrency,"Explaining USDC for everyone USDC is an ethereum based token founded by the circle foundation and coinbase. When you send money to the foundation it sends back en equivalent amount in USDC, the USD given to USDC is used to back the coin, although it's not backed 1:1, 61% of its assets are dollars, compared to normal banking, that's pretty good!

USDC is commonly used to transfer money from other places without dealing with borders and governments, it also allows to be a pegged coin that many other coins can trade with.

For example, theoretically, you may not be able to trade ETH to XLM but you can turn that ETH to USDC then to XLM. 

USDC is attempting to become a public company in the near future, and i think it's amazing if it does, usdc is very bullish on Coinbase's future, since CB works with the circle foundation. As more people move from USDT to USDC it will hopefully become a larger player in the market."
CryptoCurrency,"Coinbase Visa Card Hey all, I just wanted to share some initial thoughts.

I recently decided to get the Coinbase card. I was on the waitlist for about a month and a half until I saw a post on another subreddit about a guy that got his after 6 days waiting. He suggested to open a support case. I did so over the weekend and I suddenly received my approval email today.

I am kind of excited and I will tell you why.

I usually use an AMEX card for all of my bills and day to day expenses because I want to get points. I pay off my balance on the statement close date to not incur interest charges. However, doing this becomes a snare because I get used to just blindly charging anything and everything to the AMEX card and I usually end up using the points to pay off the card or subsidize a big purchase. 

Enter the Coinbase Visa card. It is actually a prepaid debit card that gives you 4% XLM or 1% BTC cash back. By using the Coinbase Visa card I am forced to stay on top of my purchases and not blindly spend money. In addition I'm getting way more cashback than whatever I was getting on my AMEX.

Another thing is that, if you've been in this space for a while, you're bound to get some nice airdrops and (I know this is controversial) have to pay the tax man. I would set aside whatever capital gains/airdrop income I owe and put it in my Coinbase card right before submitting my debit card payment, further getting cashback from paying the tax man. So If I have to pay $10,000, I would get $400 cashback from that trasanction! 

Plus USDC gives more interest than my bank's savings account. I saw something about 4% APR for USDC coming soon, so I wonder if can get in on that action while doing all this.

The only thing I need to look out for is if someone steals my debit card info from some places I make purchases... you know, like when using your bank card. Still gotta do research on that. I wish there was some kind of purchase approval pop up on the Coinbase app or something for extra security. 

Tldr: Excited about Coinbase card even though it is a prepaid debit card. That way it helps you stay on top of purchases by not spending what you don't have and earn nice cashback and interest while doing so."

I'm personally doing ETH-XMR-VET-ALGO in a 30-30-20-20 split.

* XMR because privacy is the biggest thing in these times,

No wonder they had zero upvotes. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here's my take on the topic: a single downvote can't be from a downvote bot. It's either the post is a shit post and it really deserves to be downvoted or a shitty person keeps on downvoting all posts so that his posts would be more conspicuous than the others. These shitty persons probably do this because they are farming Moons.

Anyway, if a post has good content and truly valuable information, I'm sure that it will get upvotes. If you're posting for the sake of moons, don't expect much and blame bots when people are downvoting you because of your desperate attempt to gain Moons.

CryptoCurrency,"Coins v. Tokens &amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/idt4vv992hc71.jpg?width=825&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3e0b8fac4565b3321511350f456533c1ae711c84

Oftentimes we use coins and tokens interchangeably to refer to our cryptos. However, there is a slight difference between the two which many would simply neglect for convenience.

&amp;#x200B;

Let me explain this difference.

&amp;#x200B;

Coins refer to any cryptocurrency that has a standalone and independent blockchain. For example, BTC, ETH, ADA, ATOM, ALGO, XRP, XLM, DOT and KAI are coins because they run on their own blockchain, not just simply built on top another blockchain.

&amp;#x200B;

On the other hand, tokens are derivatives of the primary blockchain. To simply state it, tokens are built on top of another blockchain, specifically smart contract blockchains. For example, LINK, USDT, USDC, CHZ and UNI are tokens that are built on top of Ethereum.

&amp;#x200B;

Let us proceed on more complicated scenarios.

&amp;#x200B;

LUNA, OSMO, CRO, BNB, XPRT, DVPN, AKT and IRIS which are built using Cosmos SDK are not tokens since they run on their own standalone and separate blockchain. Cosmos provided a software development kit to make it easier for projects to build their own blockchain patterned after that of Cosmos.

&amp;#x200B;

While MIR and ANC which are projects built on top of Terra's blockchain are tokens because they do not have a blockchain of their own.

&amp;#x200B;

I hope these make everything easy to understand."
CryptoCurrency,"Conspiracy: I believe there’s downvote bots on this board Every time I sort the posts by new, I notice that posts are instantly bombarded with downvotes while certain stocks that appears to be pumps are getting upvoted like crazy. To me it seems theres bots similar to what was posted to in regards to this but rather the bots posting similar comments..... it appears they’re doing the follow:

1. Posting a bump or farming post
2. Downvote the shit out of al new posts to have the algorithm favour their post


I tried following some new posts and found that they get downvoted almost instantly to 50%-65% while a short post about “crypto name” gets an average 95% to 100% with those short comments either saying “crypto name” or an emoji.

CryptoCurrency,"I am addicted to buying the dip and this is not financially healthy I bought and joined the crypto space during the ATH this year. I am very confident with my purchases because  I did my own research. I DCA, HODL and STAKE, however, whenever there is a dip I put in some extra cash in. I am beginning to feel that I am addicted to the dip and this is not a healthy relationship. 

I put in more cash in despite just recently bought a house and there are plans to renovate. I always tell myself it's just another $100, it ain't a biggie, but it all adds up. 

So what I am trying to say is if you have an unhealthy relationship with the dip like I do maybe it's time to reevaluate your enter strategy. Due to my financial situation, I have set a limit today. No more than a certain amount is to be invested in crypto no matter the dip. Just DCA every weekend."

CryptoCurrency,"Would you invest in a coin that promotes homeownership? 🏡 The vision:  A coin backed by a network of homes that people actually live in. After all, few things could be as tangible or as real as the home you live in. And real estate is one of the most stable asset classes, at the same time also keeping pace with inflation unlike fiat pegged stablecoins. So while this coin may not be stable in terms of its peg to fiat, it is more stable in terms of preserving purchasing power. Eg 1 coin = 1USD now but may be 2USD in the future, vs USDT which will still be 1USD. Just as importantly, it provides an alternative to fiat or gold.

The hope is that pegging it to real estate would mean that it keeps up with inflation and with lower volatility, could make it suitable for daily purchases and transactions. It might also lower the cost of borrowing which could make Defi more competitive with Cefi. Eg, with interest rates around 10% who would take out a home loan in crypto when fiat interest rates are 1-3%? Or just reduce the collateral needed.

A brief overview of how it would work is that the money raised for this coin would go towards a co-investment in people’s homes. The co-investment will be paid back when the homeowner sells their house or after a predetermined number of years eg 30 years. The money can then be used to co-invest in another home.

If you're wondering where the homes that back this coin would come from, here's where the idealistic part comes in.
The first group is renters, so many people are renting when they hope to own their own homes, instead of paying a landlord why not build up your home equity and wealth instead? The co-investment could fast forward their homeownership dreams by years by coming up with the down payment and other upfront costs.
The second group faces systemic discrimination such as women, racial and sexual minorities or even just singles who don’t benefit as much from governments’ family planning policies and subsidies. They typically take a long time to save up for a down payment if ever. A co-investment can be very empowering by making up for the shortfalls in the system immediately.
The third group is those who already have a home and may still be paying off their mortgage and want to tap into their home’s equity. Some may have run into financial difficulties, some want to cash out a portion of their homes. Instead of taking a home equity loan which results in more debt that you have to pay interest on, a co-investment gives a debt-free way to tap into their home equity.

This is a pretty high-level overview of how it works and who it intends to serve, if you have any questions or doubts do comment below!"
CryptoCurrency,"Why some of us still chose BTC and ETH even if we are still going down Im from Argentina where most of us cannot buy USD legally in the bank, if we want to buy USD we have to go to the black market or P2P finding other person who wants to buy/sell. Now, those who can buy in the bank, probably 1-5% of the population, have a monthly limit of $200. Those who can buy the $200 in the bank, can buy it at 1 USD = 100 ARS aprox and then they also put you some taxation above it. In the black market is 1 USD = 180 ARS aprox. Those who cannot buy USD (that now has a 5% inflation?) are stucked with ARS that has 50%+ inflation per year and banks are giving 20-30% interest, so most of the people lose money at gigantic steps since we dont have good traditional investment tools in here.

The hash rate estimated on 04/14//2021 peaked at 198.514 TH/s. The hash rate estimated on 06/26/2021 hit a low of 58.461 TH/s. This was found at [blockchain.org](https://blockchain.org) using the raw values in the past year.

[https://www.blockchain.com/charts/hash-rate](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/hash-rate)

According to [bitcoin.org](https://bitcoin.org/) ""As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers.""

Now, according to nature scientific journal, China made up a large percent (75%) of the mining capacity of the blockchain. If the ban was truly in effect and China miners actually shut down, the drop in hash rate would make sense.

China is one of the most popular places for bitcoin mining, but the government is strongly opposed. It recently announced several crackdowns on mining and using cryptocurrency, which sent the value of bitcoin and others plunging.

Bolivia &amp; Ecuador

Bolivia banned cryptocurrency in 2014 and still has not come around. Following Bolivia’s ban, Ecuador also decided to implement a similar ban. However, in Ecuador, using cryptocurrency for payment is illegal but trading is allowed.

Algeria, Egypt &amp; Morocco

Algeria banned the use of cryptocurrency in 2018, citing that it lacks the physical backing that fiat currency has. In Egypt, the government has not placed an official ban on bitcoin, but the Islamic Legislator has said that cryptocurrency is not allowed under Sharia law. Morocco banned it a year earlier due to concerns about hidden payments.

Turkey, Qatar &amp; Iran

Turkey implemented a ban on “digital tokens” on April 30 in an attempt to boost the Turkish lira, but the move backfired and caused crypto trading platforms to collapse. Critics of Erdogan claim the ban was implemented to prevent Turkish citizens from converting their savings into cryptocurrencies and protecting them from the government.

Qatar has banned crypto outright, whereas Iran has traditionally allowed cryptocurrency mining. However, due to major blackouts from the high use of energy required for mining, President Hassan Rouhani has placed a temporary ban."
CryptoCurrency,"Coinbase is an asshole, and their support staff are doodooheads. Earlier this year... February or so, I signed up for coinbase as an on-ramp. Or tried to. I have a non-standard ID. It's a government issued driver's license, but its still different. Enough so that automated systems don't recognize it as valid. 

Coinbase isn't the first to have a problem with it, and they won't be the last. It took 4 months to get them to manually verify me. Everything was fine for 3-4 weeks, then verification was pulled for some reason. 

So, I reuploaded my photos, knowing their system wouldn't work, but gave it a week to do its thing before I reached out to them. When I did, I had to wait almost a week for a response, telling me what I already know. I need to upload photos and be verified. 

I tell them what happened the first time around, and that my ID has issues with automated systems. Where the initial message was typed by a human, the response I got was a scripted ""this is how you upload photos for verification""

I again respond to them that I understand how to verify, that it was previously working, something happened on their end and I lost my verification, and would need manual verification again. No response. 

Today, i get an email that the ticket has been marked as resolved and closed. I check the app, and sure enough, still not verified. 

I get that support folks have crappy thankless jobs, but that's not really an excuse to ignore a customer, mark an open unresolved ticket as resolved, and close it. The only time I've ever done this is when I reach out to a person and receive no response 3 times. 

I can still use them as an on-ramp, but I can no longer do the promo videos, so its not all bad... but I don't think I'll be using them as an on-ramp anymore. Support pulling crap like this is a big red flag for me. 

To not appear like I'm shilling for the company I moved to, I won't mention it... but 3 emails between me and them, and I'm verified and good to go.

They tout an exclusive deal with Bank of America for a debit card but a further dive appears that deal was cut with IM Finservices, a side (parent?) company the lawyer created. Even though this is claimed exclusive by recruiters, there appears to be a parallel offer through [www.Cex-US.com](http://www.Cex-US.com) that also uses the same deal IM FinServices brokered so I don't think it's exclusive.

CryptoCurrency,"Here is how I explain to newbies to get their hands on 'free' crypto-currencies. What should I add, takeout, say differently. Thanks. #Get Your Hands On Some Coins

   You know what a cryptocurrency is, you know how to evaluate a project, and you know where to find projects. The next step is to get your hands on some. This can be done in a few ways, depending on what you are comfortable with. Purchasing from an exchange, mining, trading for coins, asking the community outright, or airdrops.
   
     
   A lot of newer projects actually give you small amounts of their coins free. Usually, they will give you some small, insignificant tasks to complete, or the community may just ask you to provide your wallet address for their project. Or, if you follow them on social networks, you may be rewarded with some coin. Don't be afraid to ask newer projects to try it out. Just avoid begging for coins as it is frowned upon. 
    

   Once you have a public and private key, you are able to receive those coins safely. If someone gives you their private keys as a way to give you access to their coins, all you have to do is ‘sweep’ that private key into your wallet. Sweeping keys can only be done on a digital wallet. The wallet of a project will have the ability to ‘sweep’ or ‘import keys’. Once the wallet asks you for the keys to import or sweep, simply provide the private keys you were gifted. 
   
   As of late, I have been looking for projects that are putting coins into regular people’s hands. A faucet is one way a crypto-project can give out small portions of their coins to new users. Bitcoin had plenty of faucets when it first began. Faucets let users experience the coin. In addition, faucets help spread awareness of the coin. If a coin costs too much to send a small amount due to high transaction fees, it is a red flag.  
         

   I’ll use a Lamborghini analogy. Most people will never own a Lambo. Most people will never drive a Lambo. That is because it is too expensive to buy one for most. But, in the crypto-world, just because a coin costs thousands of dollars doesn’t mean you can’t own a small fraction of the coin. In crypto-space, you should be able to experience a coin regardless of how much it costs, that is because cryptocurrencies typically have the ability to be broken down to eight decimal places. In US currency, as in most currencies, the smallest the currency can be exchanged in is two decimal places, $0.01. In crypto-currencies, we usually go to eight places, 0.00000001 (Ie one sat).
          

    With that being said, any coin can be broken down and shared. The problem arises when the transaction fees outweigh the amount that needs to be sent. This poses an extreme risk of eliminating the little guy from the coin. Another measure I like to use is can the coin buy a loaf of bread and a Lambo in the same hour. In other words, are the transactions cheap and fast enough to buy a loaf of bread from the market; and is it secure enough to buy a Lambo?

    An example of a faucet would be going to a particular website of a crypto-project, and posting your address to receive a small amount of crypto in exchange. Another way to get small amounts of crypto is with a signature campaign. A signature campaign is when a crypto-project pays you to add a ‘signature’ to your posts that you make on social media sites. Many small crypto-projects offer you small amounts of their coin if you include a link to their announcement page, or website, in your social media posts. So, every time you post a comment on a social media site, people will see a link to The King’s Coin announcement page. 


  As always, be aware of scams. Don't give your private keys to earns crypto. Payouts of faucets are also questionable a lot of times. A faucet may be beneficial in some instances. If the project is getting the crypto into peoples hands, it's a good sign. It shows that the platform can handle small amounts which may attract more people, thus becoming more popular."

CryptoCurrency,"What to expect from Fourth-Gen blockchain tech I've been doing some general reading about predictions for 4th gen blockchain technology and I'm just curious about where innovation will lead in the next 2-5 years.

I've read quite a bit about ""Blockchain as a service"" applications and industrial applications, and while those will be necessary to push ahead to make adoption, I'm curious about applications that will push blockchain tech into homes and schools far above what it currently is (primarily financial transactions).

Personally, I'm most excited about major advances in AI that are and should be coming by mid-decade.  My understanding is that most of the current projects are focused in IoT and FinTech, but my interest is down the line tech that will surface in the security and intelligence fields.  

I'm mostly curious about where the Braintrust here is looking towards through the end of the decade.  Also, is rather not get bigger down here about investments-I'd  rather figure here on where the state of the art in blockchain is heading."

CryptoCurrency,"Your Daily Crypto Summary for July 21 Heres is my daily crypto sentiment analysis:

Long &amp; short: [datamish.com](http://datamish.com)  still registering low interest in short positions in crypto at these lower prices, revealing bears are not quite so certain as to what comes next. Not a positive indicator either, but a clear indicator no one knows what is next. The lack of confidence of further backwardation however suggest that a further fall is not guaranteed and beyond the flavoribility probability odds for most shorts to hop on.

Sentiment: https://bisonapp.com/en/cryptoradar/ Shows ETH clearly taking the lead in both discussion and positive sentiment overall in social media applications, significantly leading bitcoin, however bitcoin also maintains a generally positive sentiment. Overall interestingly all cryptos seem to still to continue to have positive sentiment, with activitiy discussing crypto being up significantly from previous days and weeks (which we also notice in the daily activity comment count)This suggests retail investors haven't been scared off by lower prices recently, and crypto still maintains an overall positive sentiment.

What comes next: Large investors seem to be debating what is next for Bitcoin and the crypto market. Some suggesting a downward trend to the next support level which they now believe will lie at 27k (as opposed to previois discussion of 25k) while others suggesting this is a ""false breakdown"" which will correct back to the daily 50 day moving average of 34,500 within the next 10 days. Overall sentiment seems strongly divided, which much like datamish info suggests that the market is unclear of what comes next, but retail sentiment remains high.

What to watch for: Tomorrow is ""The B Word"", where top bitcoin investors, including controversial on-again-off-again bitcoiner Elon Musk will be invited to speak about the future of bitcoin. The discussion begins at 9AM PDT tomorrow July 21. Further info can be found here: https://www.thebword.org/c/the-b-word

I have been seeing a lot of people spouting that 20k hasn't been retested as a reason for BTC to fall. Funnily enough, Bitcoin has technically retested 20k for the primary reason BTC was made in the first place.

Inflation

[https://www.longtermtrends.net/m2-money-supply-vs-inflation/](https://www.longtermtrends.net/m2-money-supply-vs-inflation/)

Since 2017, the total money supply(m2) has risen from roughly 14k to 20k meaning a roughly 30% increase in total money. This means, given the amount of new dollars in circulation with the amount of bitcoin, the drop we experienced to 28k a few weeks ago was actually the money equivalent of 2017 20k. Wow that's a lota inflation eh? Someone should do something about it! Sarcasm aside, retesting previous values is all bs. Stop using the past to try to predict the future. Live your life and stop checking the price charts. 

**tldr; Given inflation, the 28k test was actually equivalent to 2017 20k meaning the old high has technically been retested already.**"

CryptoCurrency,"Take a deep breath. Here is how the world changes. This is Big Tech's next big move for Bitcoin. # Could the bull market resume tomorrow?

# Are our tech overlords so kind?

The positioning is clear. Crypto sentiment is in dire straights. China already made their move, and we’re stuck back on the green energy narrative, if you’re just joining us this cycle.

Quick recap. Here are the events of thinking us westerners used to get here, as per the public’s focus:

&amp;#x200B;

1. **Jan 8 Elon Musk puts Bitcoin on TSLA’s balance sheet, plans to accept payments**

*“I don’t know if it makes sense for TSLA to buy Bitcoin \[…\] but I do think it could be a catalyst for sustainable energy.” — From the Ark Invest Podcast Feb, 2019*

The corporate treasury move was foreshadowed by his Twitter interactions with Michael Saylor

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

2**. Bitcoin consumes energy and therefore CO2  (exponentially so during euphoric price action)**

Which he was surely aware of before making these moves

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

3. **TSLA stops accepting Bitcoin as payment may 12**

ESG pressuring TSLA is a highly likely outcome for this cyclical problem in which Musk has no choice but to comply, and it's not worth the publicity hazard if his company were complicit.

&amp;#x200B;

So far as I see it, there are two possibilities. Elon had basically no idea what he was doing, and recklessly gambled with TSLA’s balance sheet. Or this is somehow a favorable situation. He is bringing attention to the problem before presenting the solution.

&amp;#x200B;

# ""Tesla will resume accepting bitcoin payments for its cars once miners of the cryptocurrency can show they are using roughly 50% clean energy"" - Elon's twitter (reliable source)

&amp;#x200B;

We shouldn’t put the man on a pedestal, or assume he’s altruistic. There are plenty of incentives within the largest crypto communities for him to maneuver. Big Tech shall have their way regardless, as they offer valuable influence in the battle of information. In this battlefield social media is already the marketing frontier for such debates, while traditional media is at best only incentivized to cover the controversies. Terms like “green-washing” imply cultism, or more importantly, that no debate is worth hosting.

&amp;#x200B;

But for Proof of Work blockchain technologies, it may be the most interesting topic to consider. Ominously, it’s the cliff hanger Hal Finney ,  early contributor and first receiver of Bitcoin ,  left as his last tweet related to the crypto.

[https://i.imgur.com/nyoZTav.png](https://i.imgur.com/nyoZTav.png)

 

To be clear, neither side is currently capable of fully proving their point. Jack, Cathie and I’m sure Elon will put on a good show. If the mining counsel’s data is considered reliable and more complete, it’ll unlock a more resilient narrative for Bitcoiners. If their ventures create economic incentives for developing sustainable infrastructures, in it may change the whole ball-game. With only their (quite) incomplete paper so far released, these remain fantastical concepts held by those with the power to actually change the world.

CryptoCurrency,"A story about my Venmo to bank fiat transfer I’ll start off by saying that apps like Venmo are awesome. I love being able to pay friends and family easily without cash. 

A few days ago I received some birthday money through Venmo from some family and friends. Super pumped and thankful I went to go transfer the money into my bank account (definitely not to buy more crypto…) and got hit with “1-3 business days” until it’s deposited in my account for no transfer charge. If you want it instantly you’ll have to pay a 1% fee which I get that and don’t blame Venmo for that.

I am still waiting for my money to get deposited into my bank account and it won’t be available until tomorrow. It’s very frustrating that banks take so long to give you your money. It’s literally inaccessible right now. 

For me, this was a pretty good example of when using crypto in place of fiat would be beneficial for all parties. If this was a crypto transfer I wouldn’t even have to worry about transferring my money to a usable platform and the settlement time would be a fraction of what we see nowadays."
CryptoCurrency,"Forced hodling, from gold seeker to (empty) bag keeper. I’ve mugged my friends several weeks ago for jumping ship, still confined it was a small relapse. To be fairly honest with you at this point I’m just going to stand strong because selling now would be stupid AF and I’ve seen 2018 turning in to 2021.
I didn’t DCA through the years though, I’m such a ignorant little C-word.
At this point I have to be fair, I kind a kick myself in the nutsack for not selling in the bullrun so I wouldn’t be a pitty twatwaffle in the bear market and could buy back like a boss.
However if you invested in long term projects, your portfolio might be ‘handmaid’s tale’ - red today. Blessed be the future fruit.

I may not have been here as long as some people, but I have been here since 2017, and this is still feeling like 2018 where users are clinging on to the feelings of the recent bull-run and claiming that the good days will return soon.

Those people still need to be shaken out, and this place needs to become a ghost town after months of ETH being flat before its time to start throwing money at it.

1) I sent in 2 wires on Friday July 9. I made a mistake in that I did not put the reference ID. Instead, I put my full name in the memo line. I have asked blockchain.com to either return the wires to my bank or credit my account. It has now been 12 days and I have yet to receive a response. I have opened multiple tickets, but just silence? Where is my money?  
2) I needed to send BTC urgently, so on Monday July 12, I wired in $25k and bought BTC in order to send it out. My send requests were not honored. My account activity just shows the deposit on July 11 and BTC purchase the same day. But my account balance is now $30. Why is there no record of any activity? What has happened to my money? I opened my first ticket for this matter on July 11 - it is now 9 days later and I have not heard a peep.    
3). I have wanted to sell the BTC that I bought on July 11, but I cannot trade it. I have to wait for Compliance to finish their review - it's been 9 days already!  Who will be responsible for the BTC market declines?

CryptoCurrency,"I want to think that I'm just being naive but, I have some serious doubts the Lightning Network can solve Bitcoin's scalability issues. First of all I want to clarify that I'm not trying to shill any other coins whose aim is to solve scalability problems. I myself own some bitcoin, although it's just a few tens of thousands of sats... not much, but it's also the biggest part of my portfolio.

Second of all I want to clarify that I will consider a best case scenario in an ideal world when it comes to explaining the limits of the LN, the real world is of course not as great as the ideal world and a real adoption of the LN would actually be much worse than that which I'm describing.

When it comes to the LN, first thing to be understood is that it's a smart contract on the blockchain aimed to solve scalability issues by taking some transactions off the main blockchain, if person A and person B are often exchanging small amounts of satoshis it's a waste of resources to put every single small transaction on the blockchain, instead they take keep the transactions to themselves and the moment that will stop exchanging they can just share the final balance of their wallets to the main net after all those exchanges.


But this isn't as perfect as it seems, to make a payment channel you need 1: the smart contract 2: an opening transaction on the blockchain. To start with the smart contract, I want to clarify that I am not aware of whether or not they are simply stored in the Bitcoin blockchain and to start executing them you have to reference them or that if you have to store them everytime you want to use them. But for our ideal world I will assume that it's the first option as it's the one that takes the less information on the blockchain. If that is actually the case, then all we need to do to start a payment channel is start the opening transaction on the blockchain, but that also takes up space on the blockchain. And if we can also consider that everyone just connects to a central node on the LN to make payments to simplify things, we have that around ~2000 people can connect every 10 minutes to the LN, that's ~12000 an hour, 288 000 a day, 105 million a year. Considering no changes to the global population (around 7.88 thousand million people) it would take 75 YEARS to make everyone adapt to the LN. And that of course is assuming 1. All new information on the blockchain is used to create payment channels, no normal transactions, no closing payment channels, no other types of smart contracts being executed, nothing else other than creating payment channels. This is obviously impossible, but it's also impossible to know how much % of a block would go into the creation of payment channels in a world where the adoption of the LN is something that is actually being pushed for. 2. Only a single central node that everyone connects to. I don't think I have to explain why this is dangerous, but a single central node means that a goverment can shut down whichever company actually owns that one central node, it's actually better a situation where every country has a one very strong node, or a handful of them. 3. That the global population doesn't keep increasing. 4. That a company that operates as a central LN node doesn't disappear for whichever reason, if that happens, all the open payment channels that one company held will go off and everyone that used the LN with that one company will have to move to another one, going back quite some time in the adoption.

If we actually go back to the real world, we can easily see that an actual proper adoption of the LN would take thousands of years. Not very scalable if you ask me."

CryptoCurrency,"A story about Bitcoin and monkeys Posted on 11th January 2018 
A lot of monkeys lived near a village.

One day a merchant came to the village to buy the monkeys.

He announced that he would buy the monkeys for £100 each.

The villagers thought he was mad.

They thought how can somebody buy stray monkeys for £100 each?

Still, some people caught a few monkeys and gave them to the merchant and he gave them £100 for each monkey.

This news spread like wildfire and more people caught more monkeys to sell to the merchant.

After a few days, the merchant announced that he would buy monkeys for £200 each.

Even the lazy villagers now ran around to catch the remaining monkeys and sold them for £200 each.

Then the merchant announced that he will buy monkeys for £500 each.

The villagers started to lose sleep! They caught six or seven monkeys, which was all that was left, and got £500 for each one.

The villagers were waiting anxiously for the next announcement.

Then the merchant said he was going home for a week and when he returned he would buy monkeys for £1,000 each.

He asked his employee to take care of the monkeys he bought.

The merchant went home and the villagers were very sad as there were no more monkeys left for them to sell at £1,000 each.

Then the employee told them he will secretly sell them monkeys for £700 each.

This news spread like wildfire. Since the merchant will buy monkeys for £1,000 each, there is a £300 profit for each monkey.

The next day the villagers made a queue near the monkey cage.

The employee sold all the monkeys for £700 each. The rich bought monkeys in big lots. The poor borrowed money from money lenders and also bought monkeys.

The villagers took care of the monkeys and waited for the merchant to return.

But nobody came.

They ran to the employee.

But he had already left too.

The villagers then realised that they had bought the useless stray monkeys for £700 each and were unable to sell them.

Which all sounds very similar to Bitcoin. If the price goes up what can you do with Bitcoins other than sell them to someone else who thinks they will go up in price even more? And what do you do with your Bitcoins when they fall in value…?

I don’t know, but just like the villagers trading monkeys, Bitcoin will bankrupt a lot of people and make a few people filthy rich.

CryptoCurrency,"World Crypto Life/IMC Token MLM/Ponzi Warning I'm seeing numerous people I know getting into this (including several in for at least 5 figures) so I started doing due diligence. This has potential to steal a lot of money. 

The new COO is Chris Principe who runs Financial IT magazine and actively used it to promote OneCoin (even putting ""crypto queen"" Ruja Ignatova on the cover) and filed a lawsuit with them to attack someone exposing their massive ponzi scheme. Raymond Follmer appears to have ties to OneCoin as well, along with ties to Reverend Sheila who claims he scammed her. Francis Yoon's last 2 businesses (Epika Global and Emperor Global) appear to have been suspended and forfeited due to some sort of tax reasons, per public documents. Another new addition to their ""team"" is an influencer called Bitcoin Brandon. (Bitcoin) Brandon Ivey was involved with KryptoGeneX, along with Stephen McCullough (of SkyBiz ponzi fame), and promoted an educational scheme that was essentially just a modern revamp of SkyBiz. This is just what I've discovered so far from the team I'm aware of.

The website is shady

[www.imctoken.com](http://www.imctoken.com)

and the white paper is barely coherent.

[www.imctoken/whitepaper](http://www.imctoken/whitepaper)

There's an MLM structure for the promotion of the coin through World Crypto Life where you get bonuses and passive income through recruitment. They created their own exchange in order to sell their coin. Investment is locked up for 6 months and released in intervals to ""control price."" They tout an exclusive deal with Bank of America for a debit card but a further dive appears that deal was cut with IM Finservices, a side (parent?) company the lawyer created. Even though this is claimed exclusive by recruiters, there appears to be a parallel offer through [www.Cex-US.com](http://www.Cex-US.com) that also uses the same deal IM FinServices brokered so I don't think it's exclusive. Others have claimed BoA denies this partnership altogether but I can't speak to that part.

CryptoCurrency,"Binance is Refusing to Provide Trade History for all US Residents Context:  
You probably guessed it, I live in the US. I was using [Binance.com](https://binance.com/) before there even was a [binance.US](https://binance.us/), and in Jan 2021 I get the notification that I am a US resident, my account will be closed, need to withdrawal all my funds, blah blah blah. Kinda annoying, but no big deal.

A few months ago, I needed to see my trade history from last year. I contact [Binance.US](https://binance.us/) support, they say they can't help me because [Binance.COM](https://binance.com/) and [binance.US](https://binance.us/) are different entities. So I go to [Binance.com](https://binance.com/) and ask for access to my trade history, and they straight up stop answering me as soon as I asked. Radio silence.

Fast forward to this morning, I'm on a chat with [Binance.com](https://binance.com/) support, and they are repeating the same information after every response. ""We are unable to assist you with this because you account has already been deactivated."" And they say they can't reactivate an account from an unsupported country (...the US).

So therefore this means that everyone in the US who had a Binance account can't get access to their trade history of any year or anytime during when they had the account. Obviously, for tax and financial documentation purposes, **this is a very serious problem**.

One thought that keeps reoccurring to me is when will we begin to see similar projects (NOT talking about anything the size of Cardano or Polygon) merging to create ""super projects"" or something more substantial? Substantial as in projects making larger strides/improvements to the industry.

I'm sure it's happening already, but the reason I ask this is because there seem to be thousands of projects and groups behind them, some with very similar purposes or end goals.

Look at what they did to you: Dont you feel silly every time at work when you say ""i will email you"" as if there was a slight chance that you were going to bust out a postage stamp and send a physical letter to that person four feet away from you instead?  No you say ""i will drop this in the post"" when you talk about the physical realm because you have unresolved guilt, but we can cure you still with mindfulness and moons.

If the crypto community just started saying ""Currency"", with a gigantic phallic obelisk blurred in the bokeh landscape behind us, as in ""yes of course crypto, not fiat"" does that inspire normies to understand what is happening, and does it teach them the concept of fiat? That not all money is fiat. It doesn't have to be chinese food seven days a week, Jinping. Put a glistening taco on the dinner table for once. Buy some Ethereum.

CryptoCurrency,"We might have had the phase of mind-blowing gains already I think there are many people who take for granted that we are indeed going to see a bounce back after this market ""cools off"" so to speak. And overall I believe cryptocurrencies will perform really well in the course of multiple years, but nobody really knows what is going to happen in the short term. You might want to be cautious when trying to compensate possible previous losses, by trying to buy the dip.

In my opinion, there were like literal writings on the wall of a mania in the cryptocurrency space, which generally brings more attention, more buyers and ultimately more money to the space. Dogecoin for example made massive gains in the span of few months (it was 1p in January and peaked 0,68$). It doesn't have a proper value proposition and I think everyone just wanted a slice of the gains because Elon tweeted Doge. This in my opinion goes to show that we might have been just a tiny bit overheated in the market, if a coin created in 2013 based on a old doge meme, managed to reach 70B market cap.

All I am saying is that the money that you put into cryptos has to be money that you could spend for takeout food or coffee, something that you couldn't give a rats ass about. Then you are prepared to have it both ways: The dip gets deeper, but you wont even flinch about it, or we actually have reached the bottom and you make nice gains on your money.

CryptoCurrency,"Possible trading strategy: covering from fluctuations like hedge funds Brief intro: I'm a 3rd world country economics student a from Argentina. I write mainly about inflation and it's problems (my country has 50%+ inflation, so I live the topic daily). Everyday I do research about a certain topic and publish the results at the subreddit, usually a good exchange of ideas comes at the comments. I do this to share knowledge/create good content. Please correct my spelling mistakes as this helps improve my english! Hope you enjoy! First of all fuck hedge funds!

I was doing research about hedge funds and what strategies they use to earn returns above the average from the market using aggressive techniques. I found out that one of the strategies they employ is the following:

Imagine two companies within a certain sector (say farmaceutical, for instance) let's call this companies A &amp; B. The hedge fund (in this case ourselves) knows that company A will be outperforming company B within the same market segment. A strategic approach might be buying stocks from company A and shorting company B. When doing this, the approach becomes more market neutral. What's the reason behind this? If the market rises, you will have loses with the shorts, but they will be over-compensated by the gains from the buying of stocks A. If the market drops, the profits of the short from B should outperform the loses from stocks A. So, as long as company A outperforms B you will have returns.

I thought this market neutral risk approach might be used with bitcoin and altcoins. If we are indeed in a bear market bitcoin dominance will continue to rise as we have seen in the previous two months. If that's the case, maybe DCA into bitcoin while shorting the worst performing projects that are altcoins (diversify because of possibilities of a short squeeze of alts, such as the one of GME), this could make the investor have returns in dollars while DCA into Bitcoin - a pretty sweet deal.

Disclaimer: I don't encourage anyone to use this strategy nor day trade, specially with leverage, because they are risky strategies and you will probably lose most of your money.

Stablecoin on BSC DeFi earning 10-60%

Hold and don't trade: Hodl Bitcoin only (over years, altcoins all tend to drop against Bitcoin). General feeling is this bull run is going to 85k-150k, and then a 70-90% drop.

Hold and don't trade: 76% BTC 24% ETH (Optimal risk-return for a hodl portfolio)

Hold and don't trade: 50% BTC 50% ETH

Hold and don't trade: BTC, ETH, BNB

DeFi on BTC, ETH, BNB, and stablecoins

Altcoin/shitcoin Roulette (over 100% returns, but also risk of exit scams, rug pulls, 100% loss) &amp; maybe staking on binance

DeFi on all coins on BSC (over 100% returns, but also risk of exit scams, rug pulls, 100% loss)

If you're a newbie please don't put the money into any 1000% APR things, they are not all scams but there are games going on with the money (algorithmic debasing etc) that can cause massive losses even with legit projects

If you're new to BSC I think putting the stable-stable LP's into Autofarm are a great way to get started, minimal risk and 60% returns. For example, deposit BUSD and USDT into PancakeSwap, then deposit the LP token into Pancakeswap (24.94 APY) or Autofarm (43% APY).

Goodluck :)"

CryptoCurrency,"It's on girls and boys, the EU just stated the progress to a totalitarian superstate is going as planned. As absurd as it sounds, we are on the way to the one world government and the last battle field will be crypto. By 2024 the EU wants to forbid anonymous wallets! 

https://decrypt.co/76432/eu-wants-ban-anonymous-crypto-wallets-2024

How they gonna do it?

Straight forward and simple, one central database (I know, what irony) that will have a huge whitelist of all legal crypto with all the whitelistet addresses. I posted about it 4 months ago here:

https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mf0dqc/my_outrageous_theorie_for_the_hijack_of_btc/

How will it work?

You gonna have licensed on and off ramps, the only ones that can be used. If you send to or receive crypto from an address that's not whitelistet your wallet gets automatically flagged and frozen in the database. 

What are the consequences?

Shilling. Have you ever seen minory report with Tom Cruise and thought about it? I recommend you watch that movie if you are into crypto and want to get a hint into the future struggle with the state. 
In short, once the government knows everything about you, it can start to run algorithms on you and see which kind of person you are. Just by looking at your purchasing behavior there will be certain consequences for you and you will start to change your behavior. It's similar to the social point system in China but 1000 times more efficient. It will be an easy system to control the herd and save the environment (we have to do it, but in my opinion in other more freewill ways 😉) 

So maybe after all, the conspiracy nuts aren't so nuts, he? 

And there will be no other money (means of exchange of value) than crypto in a few years time. If you doubt it and are really interested the future of the world you better do some more reading. Cash and digital money in current form that's not on a ledger (will say not traceable to it's first inception moment) will be a thing of the past in few years time. 

Are there positives to this development?

Yes, probably no more corruption and the ability to  switch off polluters / other illegal activities (defined by the state) on a dime."
CryptoCurrency,"Just moved to the big city and crypto is everywhere After living on the countryside of a Central European country for a few years, I recently moved to a bigger city in Western Europe. 

One thing that struck me, was that crypto advertisements are all over the place. You hear it on popular radio channels, you see it on huge billboards next to the highway, there are advertisements on the streets, promotional videos on television. Crypto is everywhere!

CryptoCurrency,"Time to expose the truth Lets expose the truth.

Before I begin I encourage everyone not to take my word for granted, but to corroborate everything I said doing your own research. I specially encorage people to look a correlational charts where you can clearly see the truth, and also to people who are good creating charts make one that is easy to understand to everyone.

Has anyone noticed how a few days soon after the IPO of coinbase where listed on the stock market crypto currency crashed from around 50k to 25k to 30k? and soon after that the volatility of cryptocurrencies is much more stable in a bad way. Meaning they playing the bear making it be around 30k and make it go down every now and then so they liquidate people and control the cryptocurrencies. Well if nobody noticed I did.

The truth is that whales like hedgefunds in disguise are manipulating the market so they make billions going up and down. Destroying retail investor to keep people poor while they hoard all the money (with the government as well). 

This should be of not surprise since they alwaya been crooked. However, they are really afraid of decentralization and are playing all the dirties tricks they can to keep you poor and under a leash as they want (brainwashed slave servants, with the idea that what you doing is for the greatest good. And the greatest good is really make them rich at people expenses.) Is time to wake up.

Anyhow, this is simply what they doing. They realised that it only took a few millions to move bitcoin price 1% up or down, and becauase when bitcoin goes up or down all cryptocurrencies tend to follow in a tandem then they have comlplete control of the market. They do this buy using  coin base and the whalea inject billions to make go up and making money and then when they agree they take all down to liquidate all the retail prices. The timing of this huge injection and ejection of money only they know. Moreover, with the upcoming of the robinhood IPO things are going to get worst.

So what can we do? Is decentralization worthless? are cryptocurrencies done? No the soluion is simple but will take lots of effort since we must gather even more people than ever before. We have to do the same thing we did with gamestop and amc, however, we must do it with various alt coins that are not bitcoin. In other words we must make the alt coins break the cycle of following the trend of bitcoin. We must play only the bull not the bear to sone alt coins. Why because we gonna make this whalea lose BILLIONS. 

This is going to be hard because this need to be sporadic  bull attacks but persistent why? Because we have spies on the forums like reddit etc. 

However, we are more by a far extent. The soli media has been label an arm of mass destruction so that you know. They fear us because as we have proved with gamestock, amc, DOGE  coin together we are strong. I also encourage to get into decentralized social media webs that are been build as we spoke. Thia is going to be our ace under the sleeve.

Something collosal is coming. Keep believing in decentralization and do bot give up on cryptocurrencies, they are the future. For now spread the word and be on the watch.

I'm humble enough to realize that I'm not a market mover or manipulator and my ability to time the market is close to 0. For the absolute highest percentage of us it's statistically better to DCA and hold. Don't over complicate things, don't use leverage (honestly, with the returns you can get holding BTC and ETH over time, why be greedy and stupid?), just hold. Don't move in and out of coins. History has shown that huge pumps come very fast and a lot of people get left out cold and ending up having to buy in higher than what they sold for. 

If you think you're the smarter trader in the world I can guarantee you that you're not.

CryptoCurrency,"If we could make a dApp (decentralized app) on a blockchain how could it be made to incentivize the desired outcome - good dates? Dating apps (and dating in general) seem miserable for almost everyone. Women are drowning and overwhelmed while men are parched in the Sahara desert. Not to mention the bots. These apps are profit driven making you feel inadequate until you pay for their service. 

***Why make it on a blockchain?*** Because as soon as you leave to develop a centralized app and get investors eventually the design will be compromised to generate profit. The community of users don't have an equal say in improvements/changes. 

Before I get too far, is anyone aware of a project that is doing this?

Now obviously online dating hasn't been miserable for everyone as I've seen many successful stories from Tinder/Bumble, but it could be so much better.  

* The community would be able to determine how they want the app to move forward and propose improvements. For example, if people wanted more swipes per day someone or a group could propose it, it could be voted on, and approved or shot down by the community. This would need to be approved by a certain percentage of all different demographics to ensure it stays safe/equitable.  (A simple majority could ruin the system)
* Identities and bots would be less of an issue. With an official identity attached will decentivize poor behavior. 
* Different settings for different users. For example, if an individual or community wanted to only have women reach out first like bumble, they can.
* a swiping algorithm that isn't designed to get you to spend money or keep you on the app, but one designed to connect you to the correct people

**Design Ideas**

* An in app currency that allows you to do basic functions like swipe and for higher amounts do. A certain amount would be given for free, but could be purchased in limited monthly quantities. This provides enough money in the system to cover the transactions on the blockchain but inflates the value as to not incentivize accumulating the token. **If someone could come up with a way to make this work without monetary value at all that could be better. Money makes people less likely to mess around, but it is not equitable**
* Have a limited amount of active conversations (maybe 3 min -10 max). This prevents people from hoarding matches or being overwhelmed. When the conversation dies out, moves off the app, or ends terribly one of the users has to end the conversation before talking to a new match.
* When a conversation is ended there would be a feedback mechanism that rewards users that are respectful/genuine (I have not yet thought through this completely yet - hopefully someone smarter than me has an idea). If you ghost/have poor messaging skills/swipe on anyone and everyone your in app currency will become more scarce. 
* Community posts, activities, dialogue etc to help our generations fix the toxic qualities of our current dating culture. This could include guides or videos on developing healthy relationships. 
* Community bans/suspensions. Individuals could review reported cases of racism/sexism/assault and all other forms of harm and oppression. The reviewers would be given in app currency and maybe some marker on their profile to show they care about a positive/healthy community. 
* Dystopian Black mirror-esque ideas include having a public or private score that reflects your performance, allowing users to leave comments for the next person that swipes on them, permanently ban people, or sending feedback 
* Utilize LINK to import different types of data - there's potential here, but I need to give it more thought

What blockchains out there would be good for something like this? I think something that has low transaction fees and high speeds would be good candidates (off the top of my head ADA, VET, ALGO, SOL)."

CryptoCurrency,"Just bought 1K worth of BTC and 1K of ETH. Did I just make a mistake?! Okay so I’ve been dollar cost averaging in for a while now, but looking at the dip I just really wanted to dive in further. I’m hoping I didn’t just dive head first into the shallow end of the pool though.

2K is a lot of money for me but when I think about the potential gains in crypto over the stock market i prefer crypto.

I’m almost up to 3 ETH and .2 BTC  I’m in no way a high roller, but I can’t help but feel like I’m messing up with buying right now"
CryptoCurrency,"In spite of recent EU FUD i researched European parliament parties' views on crypto. How crypto-friendly are they? First of all keep in mind there's dozens of parties from dozens of countries into each parliamentary group, so they are not 100% on something.


**EPP** - Largest group 178 members, Liberal Conservatives - **slightly to medium against crypto**


**S&amp;D** - 146 members, Socialists, Left - **Claim to be pro crypto but in reality they want strong regulation** 


**Renew** - 98 members, Centre Liberalism - **Pro crypto, but calls for transparency, integrity and accountability** 


**Green Party** - 73 members, Greens - **Pro regulation** 


**ID &amp; ECR** - 71 and 61 members, Right-Wing - **Unclear position, possibly leans against** 


Honorable mention: Pirate Party MPS' - 4 members **PRO CRYPTO YESSS**



So it seems like basically every party wants crypto regulations, but good news is that you can contact your representatives if you're from EU and tell them about your views politely and maybe teach them, it has happened many times in the past that a bill failed because a lot of people wrote to their representatives.

CryptoCurrency,"Moons &amp; Premium Subscriptions for MODS? Reading through the threads I have noticed there seems to be some polarization over Moon coins, their distribution, and the incetive to comment or post in order to gain Karma to get coins during distribution. While I am ok with the process for distribution, I have to object a bit to the MODS receiving 10% distribution monthly. I know they do a ton of work on a daily basis, but don't they also receive the monthly subscription fees that some pay for premium services here? it seems to me like a double dip. If one month there XXXX amount of subscriptions, the moon distribution should be lowered by that amount to the MODs and should be redistributed to the community. If those subscriptions only go to a select few, are they the ones not receiving moons monthly?

What am I missing here?? I feel having a select few with a large bag of any token is a bad idea..."
CryptoCurrency,"People are saying the dip will continue to dip, I say the dip will raise! Many cautious people telling others that the dip is gonna dipping further, but that's not for sure.

Ofc cryptomarkets are volatile and anything can happen, but past months show that on the day of payday the chart will start to rise again. Payday is around next week plus minus few days, which means the dip can dip just a little further until people get their paycheck, hop in crypto, boost the markets 2.5 weeks long around approx. ~2k ETH +/-100$

I'm just guessing the charts here, but if you compare the 2 ""bearish"" months ago, this is likely to happen...I would also dare to predict that August+September+Oktober will be the same with peaks minus 100$ each month, at November/December (Christmas!! People need fiat for presents!!!)/January (People burnt of fiat) stronger bear. February will be crypto spring.

TLDR of the article: they explain the history of Satoshi, talk about how digital money became a possibility under Satoshi, the failures of cypherpunks, the history of Bitcoin

Ok this wax super interesting. ""immune to printing-press-happy central bankers and Weimar Republic-style hyperinflation."" They, in 2011, talked about inflation hitting the world and how Bitcoin would be immune to it. Guys, in 2011, Bitcoin was already a hedge to inflation!

They talk about the $29 bubble Bitcoin was in, was the end of Bitcoin and show a few graphs. 

They give personal accounts of people losing their BTC

""he lost about 7,000 bitcoins, at the time worth about $140,000. ""I spent a week trying to recover it,"" he says. ""It was pretty painful."" This one really hurts. That 7000 BTC is worth nearly 210 million today.

They then go on about all the failures of Bitcoin and hacks and scams and all that, mt gox being one. but interestingly mt gox was hacked in 2011 and 2014. They only talk about the 2011 one cause. This article was made in 2011"

CryptoCurrency,"Convergence of Nuclear Power and Crypto? First time poster and a little daunted posting here, but I'm hoping this gives off some positive vibes and helps us all zoom out a little bit today!

**TLDR; Bitcoin incentives renewable energy. It offers an opportunity to subsidize the nuclear power industry and gives it a competitive economic advantage against traditionally cheaper fossil fuel competitors. Not to mention decreasing the Bitcoin mining carbon footprint in the process.**

The US nuclear industry has endured consistent FUD for decades. It combats optic problems that arose from past events (Fukushima, Three Mile Island, Chernobyl) as well as economies of scale issues that make it hard and expensive for it to compete with its cheaper competitors on $/kWh basis (especially natural gas). Despite the obstacles, its experts continue to innovate and develop some pretty incredible technological feats. I encourage you guys to check out some of the most recent developments in [advanced Small Modular Reactor (SMR)](https://www.energy.gov/ne/articles/nrc-approves-first-us-small-modular-reactor-design) technology.

Obviously Bitcoin has also endured a large amount of FUD yet the network has continues despite. The ESG concerns surrounding PoW mining has been one of the big drags on the market for years. The age old question comes to mind, ""Does Bitcoin deserve the resources it consumes?"" Well China says no. Or at least not when compared to its digital Yuan. And after the recent China crackdown miners are scrambling, trying to seek cheaper and alternative sources of energy. This is the story that I'm trying to keep up with at the moment. Where will they land, and does Bitcoin really incentivize clean energy like Nic Carter and Jack Dorsey have proclaimed?

The answer is going to take awhile to materialize but it might just be starting to take shape right now.

In past few weeks we've seen a couple of examples of nuclear companies teaming up with miners to use excess stored nuclear energy for mining operations ([Oklo](https://www.world-nuclear-news.org/Articles/Oklo-to-power-Bitcoin-mining-machines) and [Talens](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/cryptomining-firm-terawulf-joins-talens-nuclear-powered-facility-in-pennsylvania/)). Seems like a mutually beneficial relationship to me. Maybe it even justifies Bitcoin's use of resources?

CryptoCurrency,"How much will exchange tokens figure into your dip strategy? Until now, I haven't really thought to buy much in exchange-based tokens and coins. I have a small amount of one, which was really only purchased because I didn't understand trading pairs at the time, but I kept it for the potential reward benefits of holding it.

If the market continues to trend downwards, and if coins outside of BTC/ETH suffer a 50% drop from current prices, I'm thinking of getting a decent bag of the larger exchange-based tokens like BNB and CRO. My thinking is that they have a decent chance of rebounding with the market, but might be less risky than choosing individual altcoins (I still have altcoin bags but I'm not considering adding to them at this time). There might also be novel rewards for holding a decent amount, like lower trading fees or benefits on Crypto's VISA card.

However, I'm also aware that every dollar thrown at these tokens is a dollar not thrown towards ETH or BTC, and perhaps it's better to focus on those, but currently my gut is to diversify.

Just wondering if anyone has had any thoughts about buying into exchange tokens if they do dip considerably, since I see them brought up far less commonly than other coins."
CryptoCurrency,"Few thoughts from someone who bought in May went through the crash and have survived ever since.  

Browsing through Reddit, you may find a lot of good material of people who have been investing in crypto for more than five years, they call themselves Veterans. Sure, there's a lot to learn from them, however, I would like to give a different perspective; precisely from someone who bought during Elon Musk's bull run and has been studying and learning from crypto since May. 

First of all, if you read a little bit of the posts here, you may find a couple of advice there is constantly repeated:

1. Do not invest more than you can afford to lose. 
2. It is a long-term investment. 
3. Watching graphs every day will make you sick.

These are things that you must accept to survive here, and when I say survive I mean preserving your mental health during the crashes.

However, I would like to add a couple of other tips that I, as a newbie, had to learn the hard way. Do not underestimate what I am saying if you don't want to make my mistakes.

**First**: you must DCA to make real money. During the bull run, I was so amazed by the multiplying factor of crypto that I invested a good amount of my money all at once. When the price fell, I did not have any Fiat to buy cheaper. This means that the only way I will be able to make money with crypto is when the market hits its ATH again, which may take years. Therefore, you should invest a little every week because, if the price falls, you will be able to pay cheaper and cheaper for the coins. Eventually, if the price rises just a little, you will have fast returns.

**Second**: DO NOT FOMO. This also happened to me when I bought MATIC. After Rubio invested a lot of money in it, the price of MATIC rose a lot, especially compared to other coins. Then, after reading very little on the coin, I bought a couple of hundreds of dollars on it. After two weeks, I had lost more than 50% of my initial investment and prices have been falling very rapidly ever since. The lesson here is: if you see a coin that had, in the last two hours, 473189742% rise you lost the train. There's no point in trying to buy it. Just stick with the projects that you like and DCA. 

**Third**: if you invest more than you can afford to lose, you will lose money. This did not happen to me, but it's easy to imagine. As crypto is a long-term game, the price of your investment may vary a lot until you make real money. Therefore, imagine this: 

You invest $500. 

The price of your investment goes to 200$ during the crash. 

You need money to pay rent and did not save any. 

You will have to sell your 200$ worth of coins to pay rent. 

You lost money. 

**Fourth:** you must be mentally ok with the idea of your portfolio going down 90%. Crypto is a wild game. Prices go up and down every time. However in the long run you are expected to make money, as every person who bought crypto a couple of months ago and simple HODL on it. Therefore, if the crash comes, know it will go back up eventually and make sure you have fiat left to buy the dip. 

**Fifth**: this Reddit community is helpful; you can learn a lot here. Most of the people here want to help you. As long as you ask politely, there will be someone who can guide you through answering your questions. I have asked for instructions countless times, and people have helped me on how to sell my moons, what 'FOMO' and 'DCA' meant, what is the importance of the market cap, and so on. As long as you are aware of shilling and scammers you will benefit a lot here.

Good luck and enjoy the ride."
CryptoCurrency,"On the psychology of moons and upvoting Over my time in this subreddit, I’ve noticed that even the posts with the most upvotes are getting far less than they used to before the implementation of the moons system. I see this as both a good and a bad thing, but I’d like to hear other perspectives. 

#The good

Hesitancy to upvote means that new users and shills aren’t as likely to profit from our goodwill as a community. It does (to some extent) separate quality posts from “begging for upvotes” posts or sob stories. 

#The bad

Knowing that other people can benefit from my careless upvote means that I’m more hesitant to throw them around... and I’m trying to not think about it as much. I’ve caught myself being far more liberal with upvotes elsewhere on Reddit and I think that is good for a community in general. Reddit only works when people upvote.

I’ve also seen people go in and downvote every comment in a new post that isn’t theirs so that it shows up first to new viewers of that post. 

#My resolution

While still being cautious not to believe every sob story, I’m going to try to be more liberal and friendly with my upvotes and comments. The moons don’t matter anywhere near as much as having a community."
CryptoCurrency,"This is not a cyclical phase it is a deliberate market crash! Crypto isn’t supposed to have phases where it loses 60% to 99% of its value in a couple weeks. That’s not a phase it’s a massive crash and market manipulation. It’s banks deliberately crashing the market and not letting crypto take over because it threatens their power, wealth, and control. People calling this a “phase. Or “bear cycle” couldn’t possibly be in more denial. It’s  not even close to that! Again, it’s a deliberate and coordinated plan to destroy the market to keep wealth and control  “centralized” to our traditional banking system."
CryptoCurrency,"Ask me about any crypto in the top 100 and I will tell you why it is a terrible buy and what you should get instead. Every answer guaranteed unique or you get your money back!

Every answer guaranteed to be unique or you get your money back!

CryptoCurrency,"Has Gemini taken my money? (I need help)  Back on June 7th I bought $5000 of BTC and ETH on Gemini. I waited for the bank transfer to complete and then I went to transfer my Crypto on to my Trezor wallet but I discovered that my Gemini account was “Restricted”. It will not let me transfer any funds out of my account. 

The only thing that I did that might have triggered this, was that I linked my Gemini account to my savings account around this time. Prior to that the account was only linked to my checking account. I can’t imagine why this would get my account “restricted” but it is the only thing that I did  around that time.

Sense this happened I have contacted Gemini through their customer support form multiple times. On June 26th I did receive an Email from them saying that they passed my case on to their security team. It has now been seven weeks sense they restricted my account and nothing has changed.

Is the support form the only way to contact Gemini?

CryptoCurrency,"DCA: the boring but foolproof way to accumulate wealth. I’m not new to investing or playing with sizable amounts of money, but am fairly new to the world of crypto. Since I bought my first coin at the beginning of the year, I’ve always followed the DCA (dollar cost averaging) model for building positions. It is incredibly simple and can save a lot of heartache that comes from buying at the wrong time. There are several major advantages that come with using DCA. 

1. With enough time and contributions you will typically do very well vs the average fomo or all in buyers. 

2. ITS WAY LESS STRESSFUL! Especially with automatic buys on certain intervals. While other are panicking to buy or sell, DCA people roll with the ebb and flow knowing their buys will continue just as always.

3. There are never any surprises with how much money goes towards crypto. With automatic contributions, we can budget for our crypto and ensure we never get in over our heads. 

4. Your account will grow fast with regular contributions. Additionally, because of these regular small buys, it never feels like you’re missing the money unlike large purchases. Before you know it, you will have acquired a nice stash of coin to play with! 

Anyway that’s just my .02c. Good luck everyone. (Mobile)"
CryptoCurrency,"Plausible Crypto Applications I've been thinking, what processes and markets can blockchain be applied to?  Financial, shipping, logistics, etc.. those are pretty obvious.  But what other areas of life can blockchain add value? 

Anyone got any imaginative ideas?  Below are a few of mine.

1. **College/University Course Credit**: there is already a central regional accrediting authority that colleges and universities have to apply to in order to receive a level of value/validity to their educational offerings.  Why not create a blockchain application around college credit.  If you complete English 101 at Local Community College, why can't it transfer to IVY League U, or State U?  If it meets the requirements, why not?
2. **Genealogy research**: this one may be a bit dystopian, but I can see how blockchain can be applied to human ancestry.  Of course, perhaps the ancestry would have to be tracked through the mother because a woman doesn't necessarily have to question whether the child is hers or not.  Either way, you can create an ancestry blockchain going back who knows how far back.

Anyway, please contribute, if you care to."
CryptoCurrency,"This is from The Great Dictator by Charlie Chaplin (1940). It is more poignant than ever today. To those who can hear me, I say - do not despair. The misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed - the bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress. The hate of men will pass, and dictators die, and the power they took from the people will return to the people. And so long as men die, liberty will never perish…

Soldiers! don’t give yourselves to brutes - men who despise you - enslave you - who regiment your lives - tell you what to do - what to think and what to feel! Who drill you - diet you - treat you like cattle, use you as cannon fodder. Don’t give yourselves to these unnatural men - machine men with machine minds and machine hearts! You are not machines! You are not cattle! You are men! You have the love of humanity in your hearts! You don’t hate! Only the unloved hate - the unloved and the unnatural! Soldiers! Don’t fight for slavery! Fight for liberty!

In the 17th Chapter of St Luke it is written: “the Kingdom of God is within man” - not one man nor a group of men, but in all men! In you! You, the people have the power - the power to create machines. The power to create happiness! You, the people, have the power to make this life free and beautiful, to make this life a wonderful adventure.

Then - in the name of democracy - let us use that power - let us all unite. Let us fight for a new world - a decent world that will give men a chance to work - that will give youth a future and old age a security. By the promise of these things, brutes have risen to power. But they lie! They do not fulfil that promise. They never will!

Dictators free themselves but they enslave the people! Now let us fight to fulfil that promise! Let us fight to free the world - to do away with national barriers - to do away with greed, with hate and intolerance. Let us fight for a world of reason, a world where science and progress will lead to all men’s happiness. Soldiers! in the name of democracy, let us all unite!"

CryptoCurrency,"I just made my first purchase with my crypto card. ""The Future is Now, Old Man!"" I had my level of skepticism, I'm not gonna lie, but I decided to give it a go, and so I did.

All I can say is, I'm baffled at how simple and fast it was. More than ever I think that mass adoption is imminent and I literally have no more reasons to hold my money in any Bank. Crypto is indeed the future, and this bear market is just a flash sale for those who are good at spotting opportunities. All I'm praying for is getting paid before it takes off again! 

Happy earnings everyone, and don't stress it watching the chart every 30 minutes. Go outside, and breath some fresh air, its a beautiful day of opportunity, and you are exactly where you need to be. We wanted financial freedom, and it's coming our way, trust in the process, it's inevitable. Just hodl and be thankful that you are already part of this."

CryptoCurrency,"Hoping this finds some newcomers to crypto. It's not much but I hope it helps someone out there. Hello! First off, I would just like to say that I am still quite new to crypto so I don't post in here often. I am one who bought in at the ATH of most of my crypto, along with so many others in here. 

I have been reading a lot of posts of new members that are concerned about this price drop these past couple of months. I am not here to give advice but to hopefully help others learn what I wish I knew when I started. Most of the senior crypto holders may find this info irrelevant but I hope it will help others. 

So, you bought in at the all time high did you? Welcome to the club. I know from personal experience how hard it is to watch your portfolio dropping to 50-60% of its value. I'm right there with you. One thing I've always been told is never sell at a loss. It's tempting, I know, but hang in there, bitcoin itself was never meant to drop like this and was created to just go up. The whole market has been tough right now as we reach a critical point of investing. As we see the sea of red, not once could I bring myself to sell. Like a lot of you, crypto has been, and will be, a long term investment. With this being said, the price right now really doesn't matter as I look to the future potential of where these crypto will be in 5-10 years time. We've watched them rise from pennies, into what they are now. 

The one thing that I wish I was told about right from the beginning is about your averages. You can see your average in whatever platform you use to invest with. This is the price you bought in at. The thing about the average is, when you buy more at a price that's below your average, it brings down your average price. I've spent months buying in little by little in order to bring my average down, therefore, increasing the value of my crypto for when the price goes back up. I know most of you know about this already, but I didn't when I started. I just watched the price drop more and more and watched my entire portfolio decrease, not knowing or understanding about how the cost average worked. If you're not familiar with lowering your average, please take the time to Google it and research a bit. I just really wish I knew about this sooner when I had first initially purchased. Also, to add, be cautious with this in certain crypto. Know the signs of a failing coin as opposed to one that will recover from this. 

Thank you for those who took the time to read this. I'm not the most knowledgeable person in here and learning more every day but I really hope this post finds some of the new comers and helps them as it helped me.  If anyone has any other tips that they may feel are useful for newcomers to hear, please post in the comments, knowledge, no matter how little, is power. 

Not financial advice I only hope to educate the newest members.

CryptoCurrency,"Is my Uncle being scammed? My uncle recently came to me and said that he was part of an ICO for a lesser known coin that I have heard nothing about nor seen anything posted on reddit (I don't want to say the name of the coin in case I get in trouble from the coin or something). He said he heard about this coin from some ""crypto expert"" he saw online. 

Apparently he invested a few thousand and now it's worth over $400,000 but the ""countdown"" until the coin is on some exchanges is still counting down for a few weeks. He said he received an email from them saying how he is a early investor in the coin he can request the funds to be moved into his account using BTC. He agreed and requested the to withdraw and they said they would move it but then he received another email saying that he must place around $12,000USD in their wallet (they provided an address) for some kind of authentication department as it is worth over 10 BTC and they have a rule that if it is over 10BTC then they have to use some kind of manual verification. My Uncle didn't like this and obviously thought this was fishy so he asked if he can have his own wallet in a public exchange and they agreed that as long as the $12,000 is in his account on a site called Blockchain.com, they will confirm the transaction and then send the $400,000 to his wallet. 

Why did they agree to this and how can they verify the money if it is in his own online account at blockchain.com? 

I asked why not just sell the coins during the ICO and he said he already asked for a early withdrawal and they approved it and he also thinks the price may go down when the coin is released. I told him to ask them to cancel the withdrawal and sell after the ICO or perhaps he can ask to withdraw less than the 10 BTC limit now so he gets that money and doesn't have to pay this supposed $12,000 USD fee and sell the rest after the ICO.

Has anyone seen anything like this? X-posted on other crypto subs"

CryptoCurrency,"Opinions on crypto ETFs I'm considering switching a portion of my crypto portfolio over to crypto ETFs vs personally holding individual coins.   I'm guessing the general sentiment here will be against this.  but, I'd like to hear opinions on the pros and cons on taking this approach to holding crypto in your overall portfolio in this manner.

Off the top of my head, the pros and cons for this would be;

* Pros
   * Invest in a basket of coins with an asset mix managed by a professional manager
   * Securities industry oversight and registered organization (I know that seems questionable lately for some people)
   * Easy to own in retirement accounts
   * Transfer with portfolio to beneficiaries without any need for crypto knowledge
   * No exchange fees
   * Ease of management with the rest of my portfolio
* Cons
   * As always... not your keys, not your crypto
   * high management fees compared to other ETF's or mutual funds
   * fund performance is not perfectly correlated to the assets held in the fund.
   * trading hours limited to market hours

&amp;#x200B;

NOTE: For the purposes of this discussion, I am referring to ETF's which actually hold and trade crypto; not the ones which focus on the crypto ecosystem or blockchain.  As an example I'll use the Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund (GDLC).  It currently has the following stats;

* $319m assets under management
* Annual Fee: 2.5%
* Current Holdings
   * BTC - 69%
   * ETH - 24%
   * ADA - 4%
   * BTC - 1%
   * LTC - 1%
   * LINK - 1%"
CryptoCurrency,"Difference on staking on Celsius On celsius you can stake multiple coins and have your earnings paid out in the staked coin, or in their own coin, cel.

It seems that having your earnings paid in cel gives you a higher apy but is this always the case and is it actually more profitable to have it paid out in cel or the staked coin?

Any help explaining this is appreciated :)"
CryptoCurrency,"Understanding BSC, pegged tokens and IOU. Hi, I would like to understand how to use BSC in Binance to send coins to my hardwallet and use Metamask for staking.

I have been reading a lot and understand that you can send it using the BSC network of Binance as a cheaper way and then it wont appear in your Trezor but will be displayed in the Metamask account under the BSC mainnet.

Then I guess I can use all the dapps from BSC for staking.

My questions are as follows:

\- When I send imagine ETH to my hardwallet using BSC BEP-20, then my ETH becomes BETH right? So its an IOU agreement between Binance and myself right?

\- What happens if Binance defaults? Is the obligation gone and I will never be able to convert my BETH back to ETH?

\- If I use the BSC network, Binance will have the underlying so the point of the hardwallet is useless because they will have the underlying and you will have a copy right?

\- If I stop staking and then I want to send my BETH back to Binance for trading, does the BSC automatically convert the BETH into ETH when it arrives to my Binance account? If not will I receive BETH and then I will have to convert it?

\- Why is BETH then not pegged 1:1 to ETH? I mean under an IOU Binance has the obligation to refund you what you converted at the time so it looks like the lower gas fees are just an illusion as then you will have to convert the pegged tokens back to the original one and the discount is uncertain and can be huge right?

\-When staking using a hardwallet and Metamask (Imagine I stake using beef for example) then if something goes wrong with the smart contract or there is a bug, is there still the risk of losing the coins despite holding the private key from the hardwallet? I guess that when you agree on staking you are signing a smart contract and therefore any loss despite holding the underlying coin will impact you when you stop staking right?

Apologies for all the questions, I have been reading a lot but these questions are never addressed.

Thanks in advance."
CryptoCurrency,"ETH 2.0 staking support for Ledger Nano S? Apparently the Ledger Nano X already have ETH 2.0 staking supported on it, but not the Ledger Nano S. I can’t imagine it would be much more complicated to integrate ETH 2.0 staking into the Nano S if they could do it already for the X. Does anyone know when Ledger will support ETH 2.0 staking on the Ledger Nano S? They have announced it is coming “soon”, but I don’t want to miss out on any passive income and I would rather not buy a new hardware wallet just to start staking a little earlier."
CryptoCurrency,"The spread of misinformation is still holding the cryptocurrency market back The number of mainstream media influencer and celebrities spreading misleading info about certain coins or new emerging projects in the crypto market is getting ridiculous, not taking into consideration that a lot of their followers will be taking the bait and lose their money. 

I mean, yes the people investing in these “scammy” projects are also to blame, but who wouldn’t want to make an easy return once others buy. 

This is exactly why platforms should work on protecting their investors and community members from such problems, for example, Genesis Pool are introducing their launchpad that eliminates FUD, whale wallets and pumps and dumps, keeping their investor’s money intact. 

Also launchpads like PolyStarter where their team screens and examine projects so their investors don’t have to. 

Don’t listen to celebrities on what to invest in, only sketchy coins and projects would pay such people to promote them, so before investing in anything research the individual team members behind the project, if they don’t have a white paper that’s a huge red flag, and of course be cautions of outcomes pumps and dumps.

CryptoCurrency,"Boom or Bust Much love for all you crazy asses. I had to make a hard decision today about my crypto portfolio. You see, I initially bought heavily into alts like ADA and Algo. Then Matic, a shitcoin yolo that actually made me a few bucks. Some more random alts that didnt do squat, then some XLM. Well I realized the error of my ways and found your God ETH, and have now made it my main bag.

However, today I was tempted to purchase some more. Then my wife stepped in. So, instead of buying more crypto, we got her somethings guaranteed to go boom. A new rose gold Glock 42 and a robins egg blue Glock 43X. They'll at least hold their value and will provide hours of fun."

CryptoCurrency,"Stop thinking about cryptos as investing I have to admit, I’m getting a little annoyed by how many people talk about getting into cryptos as “investing.” Yes cryptos can make you money. But they are, after all, currencies. 

I don’t like the idea of people saying “I want to make enough passive income so I don’t have to work.” If we stop thinking about Crypto as a source of income, then it will become more of a currency. If we start viewing crypto investments as bank accounts, cryptos will grow more rapidly.

I, personally, buy BTC because it will make my family rich down the line. 1 BTC when my grandchildren are adults will be enough to pay for their college debt and buy a house. Cryptos can certainly be generational wealth…

That being said, I am not thinking about turning $10 into $1000, because I’m only thinking about turning USD into BTC, and once I have the BTC, I evaluate it based on BTC, not USD. And every time we start thinking like that, we cement the viability of cryptos, (which in turn, by the way, increases its value).

TL;DR: STOP THINKING ABOUT MAKING MONEY AND YOU’LL MAKE MORE MONEY."
CryptoCurrency,"Future of NFTs and their Economy Tokens What do you guys currently think about the NFT hype? Right before we started crashing NFTs seemed to be the hottest thing in the crypto space with everyone from small artists to big celebs minting NFTs after NFTs and people equally paying high af prices in a frenzied manner.

Now products like Axie Infinity or Decentraland that would involve you to hold in-game inventory as NFTs would make sense to flourish as long as the game remains trending and people play it often. 

But my question is what about the platforms that sell NFTs as art pieces exclusively? Like Rarible or OpenSea ? Where do you personally think these platforms are headed in sync with the NFT future ?

What happens when this pattern breaks will bring the big news of what is to come next, until then, expect it to bounce between the descending resistance and horizontal support.

CryptoCurrency,"Is your portolio doing better than Katy Perry's? First of all, I need you guys to know what a colossal jam Teenage Dream is.

Now, on January 25, 2018 Katy Perry posted [this image](https://www.instagram.com/p/BeXchJzFkhJ/?hl=en) on instagram of her nails painted with the logos of various cryptocurrencies. After having searched this subreddit I found [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/hmwuiv/how_well_would_a_katy_perry_portfolio_have/) that already talked about the image but you can consider this a post bull market peak update.

So, the cryptocurrencies painted on her nails were BTC, ETH, XMR, LTC, and XLM and the prices on the date according to CoinMarketCap were as follows:

* BTC: $11259
* ETH: $1056
* XMR: $317
* LTC: $180
* XLM: $0.60

Good, now let's take a look at 2 scenarios:

**Scenario #1: Katy Perry is a genius and sold all her coins at the top of the bull run.**

* BTC: $63314 (April 14th) +462%
* ETH: $4168 (May 11th) +294%
* XMR: $478 (May 8th) +50%
* LTC: $409 (May 10th) +127%
* XLM: $0.71 (May 16th) +18%

Assuming she bought equal amounts that puts her percentage gain at **+951%**

**Scenario #2: Katy Perry sold today**

* BTC: $29817 +164%
* ETH: $1764 +67%
* XMR: $183 -42%
* LTC: $106 -41%
* XLM: $0.20 -67%

Again making the same assumption as before her net gain would be **+81%,** which is still respectable and better than I am doing at the moment.

What did we learn? Well, we may not be giving Katy Perry the necessary respect she deserves and HODLing is the apprently the way.

Also can we praise her for at least not promoting any shitcoins?"

CryptoCurrency,How reliable is Motley fool? For about a month now they have been pumping out articles about an incoming market crash (which is not unlikely) but their latest one straight up says a major crash is coming in 2021. I'm just wondering are they a good source or like the BuzzFeed of financial news?
CryptoCurrency,"Best is not to listen to anyone except yourself Scrolling through posts and comments on the daily thread 5 people predicting apocalypse, other 5 are saying the bull market is just around the corner, other 5 bragging how they DCA’d so should you..  

Just do whatever you think its right at the moment. It won’t matter much later if you’re in for long haul, just like it doesn’t matter now if you bought BTC for $2k or 3k, or ETH for $150 or $250."
CryptoCurrency,"Which one is harder, to hold coins with loss or with profit Obviously I have been averaging down ""DCA"" my coins and I'm comfortable with it since I like the technology. But my question is 'if' all coins start to rally again and I got 5-20x return, I can imagine that it's gonna be harder to hodl with profit than with loss?

Just in my opinion, and I want to know about you guys how are you handling you coins? I stake some and it's easier to hodl the coins while its staked than just in the wallet, so that's an option as well."
CryptoCurrency,"Out of funds ""buying the dips""? Have you considered starting a personal relationship with your lord and savior, DCA? (And Reverse DCA. And a having plan. And self-discipline.) Here's a few ideas on how to get started, and what ""Reverse DCA"" really means. The very phrase ""buy the dip"" is itself, in the same zoo as ""FOMO"" - an emotion-based sentiment. (IMO. At least as often used in context here.)

First off, ""Buy and hold"" isn't a bad plan. Plus it helps stabilize the market. 

But is it really a *strategy*? It certainly can be a big part of one. But if it's just part of a vague ""buy the dips and hodl"" concept, then that's probably not really a strategy per-se. Or at least, you could probably be realizing more gains and less stress, with disciplined execution on a simple, solid DCA plan. (In part, by catching more of the lower lows before running out of money. Which should be resonating about now.)

Not just DCA *in*, but optionally also **Reverse DCA out**, at least as an additional parallel strategy that you can compare effectiveness against. (Eg you can have a dedicated wallet that gets half of your DCA in for indefinite hodling. A second wallet for full DCA in *and* out.)

I would encourage you to just *consider* the possibility that a singular focus on ""hodl!"" *could* - just maybe - be rooted in fear. (But I don't know your motivation personally. Just think about it - while looking in the mirror contemplatively, maybe even accusingly why not.) For example, fear that you might panic-sell. Fear that you won't be able to get back in. Etc.

A good DCA plan is usually a simple one. The three basic parts of a full DCA strategy:

1. How often and how much to DCA fixed $ in.
1. How often and how much to Reverse-DCA’ing fixed shares out.
1. How to know when to do which.

Regular Coinbase, while expensive per-trade, is the only big exchange I know of that you can schedule regular purchases on. Don’t even look at the charts, just auto-purchase, directly from your bank, a fixed fiat currency amount, on a fixed schedule. The high fees are worth that convenience, hands-off-ness, and peace-of-mind to me (to me personally). But I also love Kraken and more sophisticated orders - and way cheaper! - for my less frequent coin DCA schedules.

But when to switch from in to out? 

First of all, forget what the experts consider ""bear"" or ""bull"" markets. Because for starters, even if they were 100% correct to the day, that's not the timing that matters for DCA. You more-or-less want to straddle between bull and bear.

Or more accurately and to the point: DCA *in* whenever you, personally, think the market is generally undervalued - on the scale of at least several weeks to months. Axiomatically if overheated, then Reverse DCA *out*.

You could literally just base your entire strategy of when to DCA in or out, based on a Simple Moving Average, eg 50 or 100 day SMA. (Which does mean you'd always be behind and will miss some deals and gains, but it's also it's much harder to really screw up and is significantly less stressful.) For such a strategy, DCA-in, in the ""bowl"", DCA-out in the ""dome"". (At the time, the flip is evidenced by the change from increasing to decreasing slope and vice-versa. You don't need to watch the charts every day to see when it happens, the slope of a SMA changes slowly, so you can see it coming in advance - but not necessarily predict, because it can always instead continue curving the same way after flattening out for a bit, rather than reverse. The point is, it's slow.)

Or whatever floats your boat. Use the “BTC Rainbow” for general market sentiment, even for alt coins, that is real-time and doesn't have the lag of moving averages. Or use your gut. Whatever. Ideally, more than one thing.

What you use to decide, is far less important than sticking to it, and not reacting to daily news, rumor, blips, or short-term trends. Because changing your mind and cycling back and forth, defeats the whole point. Your “in” vs “out” cycles, in hindsight analysis, should very approximately sort of line up *in duration*, with macro market bull/bear cycles - but overlapping more or less half-way in between as a very crude guide. (And if you've judged the length of the cycles more accurately than an error of many weeks, then you need to be betting your retirement fund and children's’ college funds on leveraged futures trading, because you may be clairvoyant!)

DCA’ing in is easy. Reverse DCA’ing out is significantly harder. At least psychologically. (And even structurally - many tools aren’t really set up to automate it, which might be a reflection of how bad we are at it and what a low priority feature it is.) 

The idea of Reverse DCA out, is to sell fixed shares, not fixed $ (otherwise you’d literally just undo what you did with DCA). So yes, ""DCA out fixed shares"" is a misnomer, or self-contradictory.

Anyway, DCA-out is emotionally harder, in part (I think) because we all want to sell at the peak. Somehow we all seem to intrinsically understand that we can't time the bottom, but think we will hit the jackpot by timing the top!? Do I have that generally correct, or is that just my own personal delusion awareness?

But unless you have the Time Stone, or get very lucky (which will happen now and then), you generally can’t, and your sanity and portfolio will suffer by trying to time the market.

Does this work for me? Yes. I’m reasonably disciplined about it, but I make occasional stupid impulse decisions periodically that undo *months* of hard disciplined gains. (And I even quit trading while drinking two decades ago. I love beer, but not even a single sip while trading!)

If this stuff were easy, we’d all be crypto-billionaires. I'm not a crypto-billionaire. I don't realistically expect to be able to retire or quit my day job, on crypto - even though I've been in it for over eight years. (Because I didn't treat is as seriously as securities investing, until much more recently. I thought BTC was technically fascinating, but a tulip bubble I didn't want to get wrapped up in. The real-world utility of ETH changed my mind on crypto. We all have our unique reasons and tipping points. I don't want to get bogged down justifying mine.)

That's the thing about lotto-scale ""get-stupid-rich"" opportunities. Unless you create it yourself, put up the initial funding, or get incredibly lucky by buying a bunch for cheap and then totally forget you did so for ten years - it's by definition practically impossible to know what's going to be the next Google, Apple, or Doge. And therefore pointless to beat yourself up over the inevitable so-called ""missed"" and/or ""squandered"" opportunities that every one of us will experience many times throughout our lives. Just because your tweaker cousin Carl says he has the inside track on the Next Big Thing, doesn't mean it will pan out, and if you invest in every one, you'll soon be homeless.

So, in the end, the key is to have a plan, not constantly emotionally short-circuit it, and disciplined execution. Just as you’ve heard a million times. Eat your vegetables. But if you do accidentally eat a quart of ice cream in one sitting, don’t just give up. Get back on the vegetables."
CryptoCurrency,"ETH: To stake or not to stake Hi guys, so one of my favorite crypto is (ofcourse) Ethereum. And with 2.0 comming it is possible to stake it and get around 5-7% reward on various exchanges. For me this means that the Ethereum is locked until the new 2.0 is finished and launched. This scares me a bit because being locked you cannot do anything with it... That is probably the whole point haha..

So my question is to stake or not to stake. Any eth holders that can share there opinion on this?"

CryptoCurrency,"Moons Are Game Changing This is certainly not a revelation to everyone, but i just finally set up my moon vault and collected my first fraction of moons and I have to say I am inordinately excited about the prospect of finally joining in on this aspect of the community."
CryptoCurrency,"Just wanted to share that trading feels better than Cocaine. I wanna share this story with you, just in case you should have one of these ""Bigtime""-Events.

&amp;#x200B;

I do drugs, yeah. I like amphetamines or better to say, stimulants in general. 

A substance that was particularly addictive to me was cocaine. Right now I don't care that much about it anymore, its way to expensive, if I had right now the choice to invest 80 € in coke or in crypto, I would go for crypto. (Hehe all the C's make you addictive,  coke (crack), crystal, coffein, crypto,)

But yeah, what I wanted to say: During the big crash, I sold at some point (still at a win in general), so I had 3500 Dollars (Bc I paid out in BUSD, not in Euros).

People went crazy on the xrp discord, reddit was going to kill elon musk, twitter was outrageous, the whole world got destroyed in a blink of an eye. 

But still, after the initial crash, random shit started pumping (Can't name anymore the coins I saw going crazy, but a lot did)

I was talking with somebody during that time on the discord. He told me that he was invested in ""HBar"". Had a look at the chart, saw some bigger green spikes forming, I told myself ""Fuck it, all in, maybe something funny will happen"". I bought Hbar for 0.34417 cents, 3500 Dollar. 

And I'm telling you, 2 minutes after I went in, Hbar had this massive upwards spike all the way up to 40 cents. 

I am just sitting there, not being able to think correctly, I can clearly feel how a feeling of joy, a feeling of greed, this kind of greed started to unfold,  which felt like; ""MORE BECAUSE ITS AWESOME!"". It was a crazy rush of energy and feeling like the best in that moment. Rising to 0.38, 0.39, 0.40, in the meantime I got my calculator, doing the math, damn, selling right now, at 0.40 cents, I could have out of the nowhere 600 Dollars!!! 600?. A fucking 4 Minute trade? 600 Dollars? It would be soooo smart to sell now. Go and take it! 

No! I better wait! Maybe there is more. 

Long story short, Hbar dropped after this big time, I could have sold at any point below .40, but I hoped it would stay over my initial investment, but yeah, it went even below it, I was crying, in pain, getting mad. But after an hour or sth like that it went at least over my initial investment, I got even some dollars out instead of loosing with this trade. But hey, I did not get the 600 Dollars. 

These precious In-4-minutes-600-Dollars. 

Because I was basically craving stronger than I ever had before on cocaine. I was craving for more dopamine, I was craving for more. 

Guys, what I want to tell you with that: whenever you get a trade like I did: smack yourself, and sell. fucking sell. Don't get greedy. You got the chance for additional 600 Dollars? Fucking sell. 

Sure thing, if it went up higher afterwards, you would be mad at yourself. But then maybe get the initial investment out. Idk. But don't be stupid and greedy and cocainehigh like me and just keep waiting. 

The thing is: I knew at that time the risk got higher and higher with every second. But my brain switched to another mode. And this mode was dangerous. 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR. Fucked up at a trade because of greed, greed stronger than with cocaine. Felling basically the dopamine rushing through my brain and vanishing during the downfall of the chandles."

The ratio of Moons to karma

The all important Moon to karma ratio. Multiply this number by your karma to determine how many Moons you receive. (Round 12 - 0.88 [Never Forget](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mvzv9v/anyone_remember_that_time_last_week_when_the_moon/))

This number will naturally decline over time as the Moons released per round reduce by 2.5%. The drop in karma this round has been good for the ratio though and put it just over 0.3

Number of users on .CSV

This shows the number of users who earned karma for each round. The lower orange line is users with an active vault at the time the .CSV was published.

The number of users with vaults averages around 43% per round. This doesn't indicate that only 42% of the users claim their Moons though as you have 6 months from the distribution to open your vault and claim them.

(I removed the data labels for the first 6 rounds as it was cluttered)

I took this data from Coingecko on the distribution day, its in USD. Moons weren't listed before round 6 so the data is from the community.

I was on the fence on whether or not to include this as officially Moons are on the testnet and have no value, also the price fluctuates wildly due to the low volume, but the good people of the daily convinced me.

CryptoCurrency,"Being your own bank: The importance of computer and network security. If you are into crypto-currency for about 5 minutes, you will have seen the advice to get a hardware wallet.

I wont say getting a hardware wallet is necessarily wrong, but its not a cure-all solution, I saw two reports of hardware wallet users losing funds recently.  For one thing, your ownership of a hardware wallet identifies you as someone who has enough crypto-currency, to warrant buying a hardware wallet.

But whether your funds are in an exchange (boo!), in a browser based API wallet (oh dear), in a light/SPV wallet (OK-ish) or in a full-node (yay!) or even in a hardware wallet (no comment), some of the  risks come from your basic computer and network security.

Your Router

That unloved ugly box in the hall-way, with the funny aerials sticking out of it, is your primary defense against the unfiltered internet of horrors.  Your router will be scanned multiple times a by by bots, looking for vulnerabilities.  Question is, is your router secure?  Is the password the stock one from when it was new (oh dear), is the last firmware update over a year old (oh dear), can your ISP do ""remote support"" (OMG, no!), are you letting applications use UPNP to open your router ports (Nnnnnoo.....!).  Whats the worst that can happen though?  A compromised router can redirect all of your traffic, to any site the attacker wishes; fake site to login to your favorite exchange, no problem, fake site asking for your seed phrase, no problem (users of hardware wallets reportedly lose funds this way!).

Your Computer

So assuming your router is in great shape, your computer can still get you into trouble.  The router is the thing stopping the nasties coming in uninvited, but if you are downloading malware to your computer, then that is actually dialing back out, and the router generally cant do anything.  The best thing you can do here is have a computer you only use for crypto, nothing else, no emails, no general browsing, no games, definitely no porn or file sharing!  Yup just crypto.  Also you wont want to be on Windows, its a security nightmare, use a copy of Ubuntu (or any Linux distro) and you will be a lot safer.  If you dont have spare hardware, you can ""dual boot"" a Windows to Ubuntu as well, when you start the computer you can choose which to use.  The risks here are similar to a compromised router, a compromised computer can redirect you to fake sites, capture keystrokes etc.

Your Browser

Inside your nice Linux OS that you only use for crypto, it may feel pretty safe, and its not bad, but can we do more?  Lets use a good open-source browser, say Firefox or Brave (we are in crypto, we dont need open-source explained, amirite).  No extensions unless those that are completely necessary, and maybe the EFFs HTTPS Everywhere or equivalent; HTTPS drives secure connections between you and the website, preventing eavesdropping, credentials theft.  

Another good feature is DNS over HTTPS (DoH) or DNS over TLS (DoT).  The Domain Name System that actually helps your browser turn the website name into an IP address, can itself be compromised; standard DNS queries are not encrypted, your ISP or another ""middle-man"" can intercept your web requests and point you to a fake website.  Using DoH or DoT can encrypt your requests to DNS providers like Cloudflare, Quad9, OpenDNS and others, meaning you get to the site you expected to.

Your Credentials

Even with all these other things, if all your usernames and passwords are the same ""cryptonoob1234"", then compromise of any website (even if its not your fault) can lead you to having major problems.  See if you have been compromised (yet) on [https://haveibeenpwned.com/](https://haveibeenpwned.com/)  The simple solution is a password manager, there are many but BitWarden is open source (yay!) and if you have a tin-foil hat, you can even host it yourself.

2FA is another critical defense.  This second credential will stop your password leak being useful.  There are different kinds of 2FA, SMS is by far the worst (but better than nothing), using an OTP app like Authy can really be great, and of course you need 2FA on your critical password manager login!  You can also get physical devices like Yubikeys and hardware wallets can do this function too.

Is that all?

No, this is just a really high level roundup of cheap/free basics, there are many more things you can do from VLANs, intrusion protection, domain white-listing, recursive DNS servers etc., but they are much more advanced, need special kit, and might cost you some money.

TL;DR

There is no TL;DR for security, if you don't do it, you aren't secure.  Even if you do start this journey, there is no system that cannot be compromised, and the weakest point of it all is you P.I.C.N.I.C. (Problem In Chair, Not In Computer).  The best hope you have is to make your setup awkward enough, that the burglar goes next-door to the house with all the doors and windows open, because your place looks like more trouble than its worth to break into.

I am not a computer security expert, if you want one of them pay for it :)  Good luck and be safe out there."

I'm not saying sell now, but this is not the type of dip I'd be interested in buying. Volume is very low.

Though not only has this affected the stock market, but also the crypto market, it is no secret that Kanye West's albums have had an immense cultural impact on the world, though something not everyone knows is that it also affects crypto. 

While people on this subreddit are continuously posting about how it is a bear market and a bunch of other FUD, they are ignoring a critical piece of evidence as to why that is not the case, Kanye West.

In the past Kanye Wests' albums have almost always lead to an insane price surge in crypto, this is presumably because of the excitement that comes from listening to them and no, this is not something I am making up, there is irrefutable evidence which supports my claim this.

Two main examples go as follow:

1. Kanye West's Yeezus album back in 2013 released right before the massive price surge during the bull run,

CryptoCurrency,"Manipulation? Bear Market? End of Crypto? Every single dip in the US stock market history and the crypto market history has been a correction in the overall trend of upwards and downwards pressure from big money. We have seen unheard of institutional support from big money and businesses that are adopting the crypto bandwagon and using it for their profit this year. This will only continue as companies see how much other companies made as long as they’re comfortable with crypto infiltrating their business practices. 
Stop panicking like bonobos. We sat at 2,000 previously begging to get back in at 1400, we sat at 3,000 wishing we got in at 2,000, and we hit 4,000 on ETH and were imagining if we had all inned when ETH was pre-1,500. Nothing large has fundamentally changed about crypto, we’ve seen more good news than bad, but are being pressured by overall market sentiment. The normal market is also on a downtrend as inflation rate scares are mentioned. Take the time to buy in at this time, you would’ve bought at 4,000 with the same amount of upwards pressure from consumers, why not now?

CryptoCurrency,"I did something completely new and unique today. So I was looking at prices today at 4am as my crypto anxiety awoke me from sleep, ya know, as one does. I saw everything was really low, again. I'm down 50%, inflation on the rise, it's probably armageddon but I go to work anyway. I'm sitting there bored af, thinking about creating my own consensus mechanism when I get an email from CMC. Suddenly, an idea hits me. It's crazy but hear me out.

So we all bought BTC at 60k and ETH at 4k cause that's how you do this. But what if, instead of buying high, we bought low? I call it ""Buying the Dip"".

Now, you're probably about to click off this post or even downvote me for such an insane suggestion but let me explain.

Suppose I bought ETH at 1800. If the price drops, to 1600, that's a smaller loss than if I bought at 2400! Likewise, if I buy ETH at 1800 and it goes up to 2400, that's profit I wouldn't get buying at 2400! 

Now I know what you must be thinking, ""sure, that may work for ETH but what about BTC?"" The funny thing is, works with every coin, the math is transferrable!

I'm pretty sure I'm the first one ever to think of this because NO ONE has EVER posted about it here, or any sub for that matter. Hence, why I'm posting about it now.

CryptoCurrency,"Crash Course in Crypto Topics It cuts out the greedy middleman banks and benefits society. It also eliminates discrimination of lending because anyone can borrow without determination of race or background. And if you want to send money internationally, you can do so without the big fees. Example: I used to use Western Union and pay $15 to get money to my friend in Indonesia for Kratom. Now I pay him in cryptocurrency and it cost me around $1. Imagine all the people who send money overseas every day?!
It will also create an environment where inventors, artists and innovators will be paid fairly for their creations. Think of someone in advertising. The one who creates the ad doesn’t make the money. The big media does. This will change with cryptocurrency because of peer to peer transactions and smart contracts and NFTs. That’s a big rabbit hole but an amazing speculation of the future… The arts will be free, uncensored, and more fairly paid.
I do understand the fear of computers going down. However, it is nearly impossible to “turn off” the Internet. But what if all power is shut down? Total blackout?! That is why it is important we use solar panels and personal generators and become self-sufficient at a local level. Of course it’s good to be prepared for short term loss of access. I personally have four different cryptocurrency exchanges I use because if I want to sell or buy and one of the exchanges is down, then I can use another. There are smart ways to protect yourself in different situations. 
Every major country will have their own cryptocurrency soon, but those will be centralized and controlled by the government (or central banks). They don’t like bitcoin and Ethereum and other “alt coins”, alternative coins, because they are Decentralized to varying degrees. And the problem until now is that transaction times were very slow. Changes are happening this month that increase transaction speed faster than Visa! 
And people will say the crypto market is a bubble just like the Internet bubble. This is true. There are 7400 different coins you can buy. Only a few will survive. A lot of money will be lost in coins that represent projects that will never succeed. But people see a buy in at $.50 and think if it goes to bitcoin level they will be millionaires, so they dump all their cash and it dries up. I stick with Ethereum because it is the only cryptocurrency coin that is a valid Blockchain with thousands of decentralized applications built upon it. It’s like buying the land in NYC before it was a city and letting companies build on your property. The idea is to buy Ethereum and never sell. The idea is to make passive income off holding and lending and staking your asset. 
But what if cryptocurrency doesn’t get adopted? It’s happening. J.P. Morgan, Visa, Fidelity, Guggenheim, and many others are all buying in and preparing to offer it to their clients, even in a traditional IRA. Major institutions are setting up funds so people can invest in cryptocurrency using traditional methods because that makes people more comfortable. People will be able to have exposure without holding their own cryptocurrency. That is one way to do it, but if institutions are investing, they will still be in control. The only way to take control is for individuals to hold crypto themselves. But of course, these institutions will only make crypto exposure available to their wealthy clients first. Hmmm… Fidelity Investments is hiring an additional 70% workforce for their new crypto division. They are all hiring experts in the field and then saying in the media that crypto is “not a legitimate asset”. They are manipulating the market to get all the retail investors (individuals) to sell and then they can buy at lower prices. That’s why this is a good time to buy. I don’t know if we have hit bottom yet. But I don’t want to miss the run up because it’s going to be epic. Of course, if you sell, you are responsible for capital gains taxes. I will HODL, which is lingo for “hold on for dear life”. The CEO of Ark invest, Cathy wood, says Ethereum will rise 450% 😳
Did you know Cryptocurrency is being adopted faster than the Internet was adopted. It’s absolutely fascinating! That statement is based on the number of cryptocurrency wallets created each day by new users compared to the number of new Internet connections back then. As for cryptocurrency being valued as a currency, this is largely decided by social sentiment. But it’s important to know there is a limited supply of bitcoin and Ethereum. There will never be any more created, and in contrast Ethereum is beginning to burn some of their coin every time a transaction is made in order to become an inflationary asset. And crypto mining being bad for the environment… Ethereum is moving by the end of the year from mining to proof-of-stake. Ethereum is staked, or put up as collateral when Blockchain validator‘s work to validate every transaction of the blockchain. If someone tries to hack, they will lose all the Ethereum they staked, because their transactions won’t match the majority. The Blockchain is saved forever. Every transaction ever made will be saved and cannot be changed or altered. It’s called a block chain because groups of transactions are put together in a block. I know this is only the tip of the iceberg… please feel free to discuss and add what you think it’s important to share with people who don’t understand all the benefits of cryptocurrency."

Then the market dipped again and I bought the dip again…then again…then again…then again…you get the picture.

CryptoCurrency,"Let’s talk about VTHO The Vechain platform contains two distinct tokens: VeChain Token (VET) and VeChainThor Energy (VTHO). The former is used to transfer value across VeChain’s network, and the latter is used as energy or ""gas"" to power smart contract transactions.

VeChain states that its goal is “to build a trust-free and distributed business ecosystem platform to enable transparent information flow, efficient collaboration, and high-speed value transfers.”

VeChain is an enterprise blockchain platform that aims to provide a full view of an organization by disintermediating information from data silos. Supply chain data for business processes are currently compartmentalized in silos among multiple stakeholders. This affects information flow, which is again divided among stakeholders.

According to VeChain’s white paper, blockchain technology can break “this asymmetric information problem and allow ownership of data to return to and empower its owner.” The VeChain platform claims to provide a 360-degree view of necessary information linked to a product and its business processes—such as storage, transportation, and supply—to authorized stakeholders and create greater market transparency.

For example, the platform can be used to track quality, authenticity, storage temperature, transportation medium, and last-mile delivery of a medicine pack or an alcohol bottle right from the manufacturing facility through to the final delivery to the end customer. To accomplish this goal, VeChain uses smart chips or Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tags and sensors that broadcast key information onto the blockchain network that can be accessed in real-time by authorized stakeholders.

The application of sensors means that all parameters related to the product can be constantly monitored and problems, if any, can be communicated back to the relevant stakeholders. Manufacturers and customers are informed if a drug packet is stored outside a prescribed temperature range, allowing for service improvements and better quality control.

VeChain also plans to become a leading platform for ICOs, dApps, and for conducting transactions between Internet of Things (IoT) connected devices. 

VeChain makes use of two tokens: VeChain token (VET) as a value layer and VeChain Thor Energy (VTHO) as a smart contract layer.

The VTHO token stands for VeChainThor Energy and is also known as VeThor Energy. It is used to power transactions on VeChain and is equal to the cost of conducting transactions on its blockchain.

The concept is similar to that of Ethereum’s ether and NEO’s ""gas"" in that developers need to budget for a certain number of underlying tokens (which are not exposed to the public) in order to conduct transactions for their decentralized applications. Per VeChain’s white paper, the two-token system was devised for effective governance and to have a predictable economic model for decentralized applications developers.

In its current form, Ethereum lacks such a model because the price of ether, its native gas token, is volatile. As such, developers have to estimate the amount of ether required for a transaction. The transaction fails if their estimate turns out to be incorrect. VeChain’s white paper outlines several technical enhancements that its platform has made to overcome this problem.

While VTHO is also volatile, and it’s price is open to market speculation, a consensus can raise or lower the amount needed to execute a transaction. They recently changed the gas price, reducing the required VTHO for a transaction by 100x. 

There has been a great deal of speculation as to how this would affect the price of VTHO, and the bear market came shortly after the transition making it difficult to gather useful data as to how the price of VTHO would change with the reduction, however with cheaper gas the door to new partnerships and business adoption opens wide. 

VTHO is not in fixed supply, meaning VET holders generate a fixed amount of VTHO every day. VTHO is also burned with every transaction on the network. This means the supply is always in flux, and can adapt to wider business adoption without affecting businesses or investors, as the speculative price can rise without the cost rising for businesses."
CryptoCurrency,"Stablecoin Risks &amp; Perks: Instant Settlement, Financial Contagion, Bank Runs, &amp; Other Important Concepts Since most posts on this subreddit lately seem to be meta reactions to other posts on this subreddit, I thought now might be a good time share some information about stablecoins and the economic / market risks that entail.

Perhaps the biggest advantage that stablecoins have is their ""atomic settlement.""  This is the fancy, financial way of saying that the money arrives *immediately* and, more importantly, is available to be sent out again *immediately.*  Remember the last time you made a check deposit into a bank account? You had to wait a few days before you could spend the entire amount. You had to wait for the check to ""clear.""  Well, the benefit of stablecoins is that you don't have to wait.  

Banks are extremely excited about this. It means that money doesn't have to spend as much time 'in limbo' between transactions. It means they can invest it immediately, borrow immediately, keep less cash on hand to cover settlement gaps (allowing them to invest more without increasing risk), etc... by using atomic settlement, banks stand to significantly increase both their profit and their stability. This is why the FED is excited about blockchain technology.  

To understand why this is great for financial institutions, consider this: if all of the customers of robinhood, robinhood itself, and the GME clearinghouse all had atomic settlement, robinhoold wouldn't have been forced to halt trading on GME because robinhood never would've maxed out their credit line used for bridging the gap between when customers make deposits and when those deposits are finally available.  In short, with atomic settlement, robinhood wouldn't *need* a line at all for money to send to the clearinghouse to purchase the stock because all of the customer deposits would be available to them *instantly,* rather than a big chunk unavailable while waiting to finish clearing. They might've frozen it anyway, if you're inclined to believe the more conspiratorial views, but they wouldn't have been *forced* to due to lack of available funds to use for purchasing the stock for their clients.

Atomic settlement is great. So great, in fact, that its technology has led to the average stablecoin changing hands at approximately 20 to 50x the rate of a regular US dollar.  The economists out there refer to this as the ""velocity"" of the currency.  While this is great (to keep this post on-point, I'm going avoid discussing inflation) for the economy, it does present us with some new risks as well - the extreme velocity of stablecoins means that rare, outlier events can *happen faster* and with less warning.  Let's discuss what those might look like:

Right now, the collateral for stablecoins is held in a variety of places ranging from commercial paper (usdt / tether) to bank accounts (usdc / circle). The biggest concern that the government has with stablecoins is the possibility of financial contagion. Let me explain:

The vast majority of stable coins keep their pegs through the market making actions of the sponsoring companies. If USDC goes from $1 to $1.01 due to demand for USDC, Circle company will create new USDC, sell it in the markets (which brings the price back down to $1). They then take the actual US dollars that they sold it for and deposit that into bank accounts.

The issue isn’t when usdc goes above 1. The issue is when usdc goes below 1.

Yes, for every 1 usdc coin there is approximately $1 US dollar deposited in a bank account. But what if there is a run on USDC? Circle Corp has the collateral, so theoretically they can just keep withdrawing the $ US dollar from the bank and using that to buy and retire USDC, bringing the peg back up to $1. So what’s the problem?

The problem is that there is a metric shit ton of USDC out there. 26 billion, to be exact.

Now think about this not from usdc / circle’s perspective but rather from the perspective of the bank at which the collateral is deposited. Does that bank have *all* of that money on hand *all* of the time? No, of course not. They’re a bank, and unless they’re a special crypto-specific bank chartered in Wyoming, they are lending a good chunk of that money back out so that they can make money on the lending interest.

So imagine there’s a run on ethereum, which turns into a run on usdc. Circle is withdrawing from their bank deposits to buy usdc on the market and retire it. They’ve withdrawn (for example) a billion from the bank so far and have 25 billion left in deposits. But, unfortunately for them, the remaining funds aren’t available *at* the bank because the bank has leant out. *That's what banks do.* Circle, even though they have “deposits” at the bank, can no longer withdraw their deposits. The bank has to close for the day. It’s a bank run… which will then cascade into a run on another bank, and another, etc. stock market crashes, panic ensues.

Keep in mind that throughout this whole process, the bank is moving funds with a delay (regular settlement), whereas the need for funds is instant (atomic settlement).

The high velocity of stablecoins means that a run on them would happen much faster and with much less warning than a regular bank run.

If we apply this to tether, there is the possibility that significant selling of commercial paper could damage the ultra-short portion of the bond market… selling large amounts of commercial paper would certainly tank prices in the short term, however I think the bigger issue is that eventually the buy orders would all be filled and the market would lose all liquidity temporarily. Inventory (read: liquidity) is a much more limiting factor in the bond market than for the stock market, and as someone who trades bonds professionally I can tell you that things can dry up *much* faster, both on the sell side and the buy side. I don’t think this would have as disastrous spillover effects as the bank run, but it’d be a problem for any other entity looking to sell commercial paper at the same time. The bigger issue is that for tether holders, if there’s a run and the commercial paper is being sold, the value would temporarily drop below par, making tether undercollateralized. This is fundamentally different in cause from many of the conspiracy theories which inaccurately state that tether hasn’t been audited (it has, just not very thoroughly), but functionally the end result for tether users is the same.

This is what the fed is worried about. The size of Collateral deposits for stable coins and the velocity of said stablecoins has made some of them literally “too big to fail” because if they do fail then there’s a chance they’ll take everything down with them. 

The solution? To *require* stablecoin companies to deposit stablecoin collateral into silo'd banks (silo = their deposits are held separately and are unavailable to borrow) or to only allow the collateral to be held in non-lending banks. Why would stablecoin companies not want to do this? Because then they wouldn't be earning any interest (remember that banks are only able to pay out interest because they make a profit on lending out the deposits).  The income the stablecoin companies receive would be significantly impacted - it would be limited to the income from their market-making activities (selling at 1.01, buying at .99, etc).  That's not bad, so don't feel too sorry for them, but it is a significant decrease.  

tl;dr: DAI rocks :)"

CryptoCurrency,"90% of my net worth is now in crypto. The title says it all. As a 19 year old still in university living in Ontario, Canada where the housing market is completely fucked and wages have been virtually frozen with respect to inflation, I honestly feel like I got nothing much to lose here but only everything to gain. Also, I don't know about the rest of you in this sub but I can't help but feel excited and ahead of the pack when I put my shit fiat money into the future of finance. 

A lot of people may say that what I'm doing could be deemed as stupid or even very risky since they would say ""only risk what you're willing to lose"". Well to that I say that having a mentality like that has 1 foot out the door energy in all honesty. Think about it. If you really believe in something, you wouldn't even have doubts about it or any hesitations. I definitely don't. Especially with crypto. Governments and institutions can spread as much FUD as they want but their actions the past few months have only grown my confidence that I am in the right space. 

The foundation is here and only continues to be rigorously innovated. Institutions are gobbling up millions of $$$ worth of the crypto that we all know and love! They know that something special has been created and have taken advantage of their institutional powers to maximize the current situation and continue to build their portfolios in order to stay rich. 

To that I say fuck the institutions.

To those in my generation and everyone else just trying to get a grasp of the wealth in the world, our time will come. Wealth and financial literacy is changing right in front of our eyes and everything about it will be revolutionized within the next decade, if not sooner than we think. 

Times like these are what separate those who want to make money and those who want to be rich. I have dreams of owning a home and having a family.  I live in a country where there is genuinely no realistic way for any of us in Gen Z to buy a house on our own anymore through a 9-5. I don't expect financial help from my family either. Paper money is depreciating in value by the second, and despite having some money in the stock market, the returns and freedom you have in that market are laughable compared to crypto.

CryptoCurrency,"Be Greedy When Others Are Fearful This is one of my favorite Warren Buffet quotes. I think it perfectly applies to the crypto market right now. We all know (if you truly believe in the fundamentals) that over a long enough timeframe, the market will trend up. So if you liked something when it was expensive, shouldn't you like it even more when it's cheap? If you bought BTC at 60k or ETH at 4k, but you're not buying more now, you are investing purely based on emotions. 

The ones who truly make life changing gains are the ones with true conviction, who keep buying when there's blood on the streets. I know it's a meme but you gotta truly be ""in it for the tech"". You should take this time and truly research what this space is about and the revolutionary technology you're investing in.

If this is your first time investing and you're scared watching all your money go down the drain- I completely understand. I'd be scared too. But that loss is only realized when you sell. Remember this really important fact, everyone who bought the very top of the last cycle are still in the green today. Don’t make the mistake of selling at the wrong time and miss out on the massive inevitable recovery like many will. Investing is all about having a longer time preference. DCA is always the best strategy starting out.

Is this the bottom already (I don't think so).

But for the first time since 2016, when I joined the cryptosphere, I'm calm. I feel those diamond hands growing on me. At 2017 crash I had a full ethereum, I sold it in despeartion thinking those ICOs where a clear sign that this crypto thing had no future. As any other folk who sold back then, I feel like an idiot.

But not everything was lost from that experience. Since then a crypto bug has been buzzing around my head. I learned to code, I learned a lot about crypto and now I'm hodling all the way (in BTC) and starting a NFT project as a designer/coder. This technology is here to stay. Not necesarily save te world from banks or give power to the powerless as I originally thought off... But more like a techie buzz word which has value from an ""infrastructure"" perspective. Or how professor Gary Gensler said in his  [MIT crypto class](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EH6vE97qIP4) (which I highly recommend to watch as many have done so in the past), it is more like an HTTP, FTP, HTTPS kind of innovation. And don't get me wrong, this can be pretty revolutonary, we think of those protocols as givens sometimes now, but they are working constantly in our lifes. And crypto might permate our life just as much as those protocols and change our lifes in interesting ways.

For now I'm becoming a BTC hodler and a junior dapp developer..."

CryptoCurrency,"Crypto is changing my life  

Hi all! Just want to start by saying MUCH WOW! Awesome community.   
completely in love with crypto, the people developing the technology and the community surrounding it. I started GPU mining in January and put some of my profits into Doge. Was lucky enough to cash out enough to buy 2 HNT miners (Bobcat 300) that are on their way. Also purchased a 3rd with profits from BTC/ETH GPU mining. I've invested in a 5700XT and 2070 super (for games and mining when its not in use).  
I've started using a visa from crypto.com which is super awesome and makes crypto a lot more useable in day to day life. It also makes it a lot easier to talk to other people about crypto because they understand VISA. Makes the conversation more approachable and less intimidating for casuals.  
Seeing BTC/ETH balances build while GPU mining, anticipating my IOT devices. Seriously an amazing space. My friends are starting to get into it as well, we're working together on the IOT devices and it's just awesome. Feeling the love, seeing the results and looking forward to where this can go! Honestly a huge change.   
I'm a pretty dedicated FIRE EFT guy; for me, crypto is a closed financial system separate from my regular income etc. I won't put anything in - investing and reinvesting with the stuff I mine and earn. With that said, I'm already seeing crypto accelerate my personal financial goals and it's slowly starting to change my life for the better!

CryptoCurrency,"""Just zoom out"" they always say Whenever any major dips or prolonged bleeding happens, so many people just constantly remind others to ""just zoom out."" Or they'll say whichever coin/token is up 6900% up from last July.  I can't be the only one that got in around May, right? I got in to investing more seriously a few days after the ATHs, in the middle of May.
Everytime I zoom out, I'm like ""God damn, this looks even worse than I thought.""

I personally believe the charts will eventually shoot back up and long term holders will finally see some gains. But, I find it funny how whenever I zoom out to ease my mind, I end up realizing how much I'm down.

Anyone else here not find much solace in zooming out?"

It varies country by country so DYOR on this for sure, but if you are planning on holding over the crypto winter, selling now at a loss and buying back will lock in your Crypto losses and quite possibly erase any taxes you would otherwise have to pay.

I've been in the cryptocurrency world for coming on three years now and those that know about it seem to have the same consensus, they're afraid of being burned by a shitcoin. So they aren't willing to invest, further into that - the bad news travels farther than good news. 

In my opinion, we need a regulatory system in place that stops the trash coins from popping up. This is going to further lengthen the bear market as we are losing investors and potential investors as well as showing governments that there is a need to regulate it based on the amount of people being scammed. All we are doing is hurting ourselves by shilling this trash out, It needs to stop if we are going to be successful.

I've long been a non-believer in the likes of XMR. Not because it is not a cool concept or a good idea. 

Simply because, it irks regulators. 

I believe this is a wave that is coming upon us. More countries will start banning completely anonymous crypto projects. The reasons will range from tax evasion to funding of crime or terrorism.

I'm not stating an opinion about the reasons they will give. I'm saying, this likely will not be a one off thing. 

While it is a nice fantasy, having a completely anonymous crypto, welcome to the real world, where enabling easy evasion of taxes and the funding of illicit activities will get you banned.

Note: cryptos that are anonymous but allow the regulator some way of finding illicit activity may yet thrive even such an announcement as this. I am not aware of the developments in the space regarding this, so my apologies if XMR or others are already there."

(reposted with permission of u/xMcBeardx because they don't have enough karma) This is a post by u/xMcBeardx that got removed because they don't have enough karma, but they told me I could repost it so it gets exposure. I didn't look into it enough, but it seems scammy and I also thought it's worth discussing:

""I'm seeing numerous people I know getting into this (including several in for at least 5 figures) so I started doing due diligence. The new COO is Chris Principe who runs Financial IT magazine and actively used it to promote OneCoin (even putting ""crypto queen"" Ruja Ignatova on the cover) and filed a lawsuit with them to attack someone exposing their massive ponzi scheme. Raymond Follmer appears to have ties to OneCoin as well, along with ties to Reverend Sheila who claims he scammed her. Francis Yoon's last 2 businesses (Epika Global and Emperor Global) appear to have been suspended and forfeited due to some sort of tax reasons, per public documents. Another new addition to their ""team"" is an influencer called Bitcoin Brandon. (Bitcoin) Brandon Ivey was involved with KryptoGeneX, along with Stephen McCullough (of SkyBiz ponzi fame), and promoted an educational scheme that was essentially just a modern revamp of SkyBiz. This is just what I've discovered so far from the team I'm aware of. 

The website is shady 

[www.imctoken.com](http://www.imctoken.com) 

and the white paper is barely coherent. 

[www.imctoken/whitepaper](http://www.imctoken/whitepaper) 

There's an MLM structure for the promotion of the coin through World Crypto Life where you get bonuses and passive income through recruitment. They created their own exchange in order to sell their coin. Investment is locked up for 6 months and released in intervals to ""control price."" They tout an exclusive deal with Bank of America for a debit card but a further dive appears that deal was cut with IM Finservices, a side (parent?) company the lawyer created. Even though this is claimed exclusive by recruiters, there appears to be a parallel offer through [www.Cex-US.com](http://www.Cex-US.com) that also uses the same deal IM FinServices brokered so I don't think it's exclusive. Others have claimed BoA denies this partnership altogether but I can't speak to that part.

CryptoCurrency,"""Only invest what you can afford to lose"" - What does it really mean? As a new crypto investor, I saw the phrase ""Only invest what you can afford to lose"" about a thousand times while in this sub and others. It's a simple phrase that gets tossed around a lot, along with some other go-to mantras, but what does it actually mean, to you?

For me, it means an amount of money that:  
\-Has a very low risk of disappearing entirely, never to be seen again.  
\-Has a decent risk of being tied up in an asset for several years where I would lose money if I'm forced to sell at the wrong time.  
\-Has a decent chance of showing good returns if I'm patient.  
\-Has a slim chance of showing incredible returns if I'm really patient.

""Can afford to lose"" means different things to different people. Realistically, I'd really prefer not to actually lose this money entirely. But I can afford to have it tied up in investments for several years before I cash in.

But also, this phrase means different things depending on how you decide to invest in crypto. If you're investing in only BTC and Ethereum, chances are you'll never truly lose that money if you're patient and wait until the next bull run. If you prefer playing the slots and invest in shitcoins, then it really does need to be money you're willing to lose entirely. It seems like most of us are somewhere in between, with some or most of our portfolios in safer coins, and a certain percentage reserved for gambling.

I think right now we're starting to ask ourselves what we're really able to lose, or at least have tied up for several years if the bear has truly returned. I'm curious what this phrase means to you, and how you have, or have not applied it to your own investing?"
CryptoCurrency,"Into Crypto for FIAT gains?  I'm somewhat new to crypto and I've been on various crypto related groups on facebook, telegram, discord and so on, and it seems like most people are into crypto just for fiat gains (which coin is mooning, always remember to take profits and whatnot). I'm not just talking about pump and dump groups, but even the largest crypto channels on youtube are always on about increasing your portfolio and making money (fiat).

I'm curios if anyone here has a longer term perspective on crypto, like potentially replacing the fiat system at some point in the future, or using the blockchain for something completely different than just money/value transfer.

CryptoCurrency,"This dip of the dip shows us why a solid DCA plan - and self-discipline - is so important The very phrase ""buy the dip"" is itself, in the same zoo as ""FOMO"" - an emotion-based sentiment. (Arguably. At least as often used in context here.)

Just to get this out of the way first though: *Any* plan that in part relies on ""dry powder"" from the profit-taking in a previous run-up (which is good if that's your strategy), may eventually run out of purchasing power on an extended bear market, without extra cushion or ongoing infusion.

But this is far from ""extended"" yet. So if you are out of funds now, take it as potentially valuable learning opportunity to either compare your plan to actual execution, or to make a plan in the first place.

""Buy and hold"" isn't a bad strategy. Plus it helps stabilize the market. 

But is it really a ""plan""? Sure it could be part of one. But if it's just part of a vague ""buy the dips"" and then hodl concept, then that's probably not really a plan. Or at least, you could probably be doing even better, with disciplined execution on a simple, solid DCA plan.

I would encourage you to just *consider* the possibility that a singular focus on ""hodl!"" *could* - just maybe - be rooted in fear. (But I don't know your motivation personally. Just think about it.) For example, fear that you might panic-sell. Fear that you won't be able to get back in. Etc.

Hodl can be a good part of a plan, don't get me wrong. Personally, I move a fixed % of what I buy to ""permanent"" hodl wallets, and the rest for DCA. That seems a good balance for me, personally.

A good DCA plan is a simple one. You can just DCA in and hold. That's a legit plan, but vaguely ""buying the dips"" is not an optimal DCA strategy.

You might also consider adding Reverse DCA out. If even just for half of your wallet. (Or a dedicated wallet that gets half of your DCA in. One wallet for DCA-in-and-hold, one wallet for full DCA in *and* out.)

The three parts of a full DCA strategy:

1.	How often and how much to DCA fixed $ in.
2.	How often and how much to Reverse-DCA’ing fixed shares out.
3.	How to know when to do which.

Regular Coinbase, while staggeringly expensive, is the only big exchange I know of that you can schedule regular purchases on. Don’t even look at the charts, just auto-purchase, directly from your bank, a fixed $ on a fixed schedule. The high fees are worth that convenience, hands-off-ness, and peace-of-mind to me. (But I also love Kraken and more sophisticated orders - and way cheaper! - for my less frequent coin DCA schedules.)

But when to switch from in to out? 

Well...DCA in whenever *you*, personally, think the market is generally undervalued - on the scale of at least several weeks to months. Axiomatically if overheated, then Reverse DCA out.

You could literally just base your entire strategy of when to DCA in or out, based on a Simple Moving Average, eg 50 or 100 day SMA. DCA in, in the bowl, out in the dome. (At the time, evidenced by changes from increasing or decreasing slopes. Either do the calculus, or use your pretty good eyeball calculus-ator.)

Or whatever floats your boat. Use the “BTC Rainbow” for general market sentiment, even for ETH. Use your gut. Whatever.

Just don’t cycle rapidly, or it defeats the whole point. Your “in” vs “out” cycles, in hindsight analysis, should very approximately sort of line up in duration, with macro market bull/bear cycles. (Plus or minus many weeks. If you are consistently more accurate than that, then you need to be bettingyour childrens’ college funds on leveraged futures trading!)

DCA’ing in is easy. Reverse DCA’ing out is much, much harder. At least pychologically. (And even structurally - many tools aren’t really set up for it, which might be a reflection of how bad we are at it and what a low priority feature it is.) 

The idea is to sell fixed shares, not fixed $ (otherwise you’d literally just undo what you did with DCA.)

It’s emotionally harder, in part because we all want to sell at the peak. But unless you have the Time Stone, or get very lucky (which will happen now and then), you generally can’t, and your sanity and portfolio will suffer by trying to time the market.

Does this work for me? Yes. I’m reasonably disciplined about it, but it would work way better, with more discipline. My occasional stupid impulse decisions periodically undoes months of hard disciplined work. (And I even quit trading while drinking two decades ago. I still love beer, but not even a single sip while trading!)

I got completely ruined in the dot-com bubble. It was really, really bad. (And I was really, really dumb.) But I applied those lessons learned and fared a little better in the ‘08 crash, and a little better yet with BTC in ‘17. Not perfect, not ideal, not financial-advisor guru-well. But I survived and was happy with myself. 

But if this stuff were easy, we’d all be crypto-billionaires. The key is to have a plan, not constantly emotionally short-circuiting it, and disciplined execution. Just as you’ve heard a million times. Eat your vegetables. But if you do accidentally eat a quart of ice cream in one sitting, don’t just give up. Get back on the vegetables.

(BTW. I don’t do moons. F— moons. Maybe they’’’l make a few of you actual money somehow. But to me it seems like a distraction, a centralized antithesis to what this sub is allegedly about, and degrades the discussion quality of this sub - at least relative to the rest of reddit. But that’’ just my opinion. I could be wrong on any or all points, and who am I to yuck someone’s yum even though I just did.)"
CryptoCurrency,"Cost basis, transaction fee from exchange to wallet Hi i am wondering how to update my cost basis after some crypto is burned from transfer fee.

Lets say i have 1 ETH and transfer it to my wallet for 0,003 ETH. Do i just update my holding to 0,997 and don't do nothing to my cost basis? That would mean that my total cost basis is unchanged but my cost basis per ethereum went up. Is this correct?"
CryptoCurrency,"We have a nation adopting Bitcoin in the history of the World, more countries to follow! And yet we're still doubting ourselves. Makes no sense! First of all, this current market trend gives me huge respect to the early investors and Hodlers (2009-2013). Just imagine going back to that time and buying Bitcoin for 100$, just for it to crash to 4$. You've shat your pants. It was the era where there was no institutional investors, let alone a country.
The general consensus was that crypto was for buying drugs alone. The sentiment was the worst. 

However, those early investors still managed to HODL and go through the dips. They have rightfully earned their gains through their strong convictions. No one has the right to say they were ""lucky"". They went through anything we will ever face now. 

Currently, We have major payment corporations adopting crypto, countless institutions, ETFs and sovereign nations like El Salvador making it a legal tender.

The China FUD can no longer repeat. The miners have moved on to better countries. 

I don't know what else I can say to make you understand how bullish the sentiment truly is. 

We're only relying on one metric. The ""red candles"" in making our decisions. That's why we'll never be rich. The smart money see beyond that shit. They invest based on the fundamentals. This is the key difference on creating wealth.

For background info I can tell that I entered the cryptosphere just before the ATH this year and therefore my holdings are down by quite a lot just like everybody else in here.

Its really great to read uplifting posts and comments during downward trends in the market and even though I'm convinced that crypto will play a big part of the future, I still think it is amazing to be a part of this community as it brings more joy compared to 'normal investing' which at times is quite boring if you're the only one looking at it.   


Hope everyone is doing fine and I wish you good luck with your endeavours! Take care, don't invest more than you're willing to lose, DCA and remember to HODL 🙏🏻"
CryptoCurrency,"Do your wives/girlfriends also buy expensive stuff and all you can think about is: damn I could have bought so much crypto with that money lol, not like I'm actually going to tell her that (especially now since my investment is down) but it does hurt my soul a bit when she buys a few hundred € worth of makeup from Sephora and all I can think about is how much ETH I could have stacked instead. 

Our money are pooled together and I would never not allow her to spend them however she wants but I think it's funny how if I were alone I would probably live like a hobo just to buy more crypto. This is what addiction to buying the dip looks like folks."
CryptoCurrency,"Why I believe Litecoin is dead I guess you can say this for about 98% of crypto but this one in particular has me baffled with all of the reply guys in the comments. I will show you below why I think Litecoin is dead.

They claim Litecoin is not dead but the LTCBTC and LTCETH pairs have been in a downtrend ever since the beginning of time.

1)

https://preview.redd.it/o6kzib3pydc71.png?width=1457&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e2f97bc58b499442a1b587bed8de809557429d08

On the left, LTCBTC didnt even budge from the lows before tanking. LTCETH on the other hand looks horrendous.

2) LTC and Doge are merge mined and the reply guys/ bag holders love to mention this useless fact. Elon endorsed Doge and the hype surrounding his marketing is what sky rocketed doge. Litecoin does not have that marketability (something the LTC community hates btw). 

They claim the similar pump will happen just because the patten before the breakout looks similar

&amp;#x200B;

3) Declining hashrate and poor fundamentals

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9i218copzdc71.png?width=1852&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3974f06412bb6df483a7fb9b83c2102a5a64234a

Before Litecoin touched its previous all time high, the hashrate barely got to its 2019 levels and also its 2018 levels. People will try and counter this point by saying the # of active wallets is going up, however that metric simply could mean someone is buying and converting coins it doesnt necessarily mean people are buying and holding.

That also brings me to me next point which is the dormant supply of LTC went up by a huge amount. But this also doesnt mean that people are buying and hodling. Grayscale was buying a ton of LTC, BCH and ETC and their respective dormant supply was going up but it didnt reflect in the price at all.

Grayscale buying was supposedly a good thing for LTCs price but it didnt have the same effect as ETC (which was mainly backed by Barry Silbert hence the price increase) 

&amp;#x200B;

4) Charlie Lee

Well we all know the infamous Charlie Lee sold his coins story. Somehow the LTC hodlers paint this as a good thing as now this makes LTC more ""decentralized"". Not only is this stupid but also just an insane amount of copium and heres why.

If Charlie held the most amount of coins, him selling doesnt make it more decentralized because this just means some other whale will scoop up the most amount of LTC which makes this person have the most control over the price. At least knowing the face behind the whale would make things more transparent as a hodler and make them accountable for the coin overall. 

The next thing is, Charlie selling has really shaken the confidence of new buyers as when they google to learn more about LTC, the first thing they will see is the fact that Charlie sold. Let me ask you, if you are new to the crypto currency world would you buy LTC knowing the owner abandoned the coin as a ponzi scheme or invest in a coin that has many devs and an owner who is passionate about his  creation.

&amp;#x200B;

Final Thoughts

LTCs poor movement compared to other majors in this past bullrun has shown the publics disinterest in the coin. The BTC and ETH pairs have forever gone in a downspin and look absolutely terrible. The USD price barely made an all time high before crashing 72% (and counting). My biggest mistake was buying this coin."
CryptoCurrency,"Crypto mining in 3rd world countries: the untapped potential? Brief intro: I'm a 3rd world country economics student a from Argentina. I write mainly about inflation and it's problems (my country has 50%+ inflation, so I live the topic daily). Everyday I do research about a certain topic and publish the results at the subreddit, usually a good exchange of ideas comes at the comments. I do this to share knowledge/create good content. Please correct my spelling mistakes as this helps improve my english! Hope you enjoy! 

This is more of an idea than a deep analisis. But mainly the question in my head was, why are no miners coming to Argentina?

I know we have an unstable economy, 50% inflation, capital flow controls among other problems. But when mining you are paid in crypto and this makes it much easier to avoid the dirty hands of our corrupt goverment, you can transfer you BTC almost instantly for example, so you have very low financial risks.

Most importantly is this factor: electricity is really, really cheap because the goverment subsidizes it. For example, my family pays 10 dollars of electricity a month. If I'm not mistaken, as the electricity cost is the hardest burden for mining, I think this could open up a series of opportunities for foreign investors and also crypto enthusiasts within the country. Although the cost would be paid by the goverment but I really don't care because they are corrupt as hell and steal everyday.

Regarding that, I want to know if anyone has experience in mining from home with small operations. I have about 1200 dollars saved (4 months salary) and I want to know if I can start mining at small scale with that. (Preferably if anyone lives in Argentina and has done something similar). As I think this could be a great boost to my income at a potentially low cost (maybe 5-15 dollars a month in electricity?). For those that mine from home, what devices/models do you use? (I literally have no idea regarding mining other than you need to cool it and you need a strong first investment).

I will do a Q&amp;A in the comments in the following hour after publishing the post while at work. You can ask about our economy, my experience with inflation and the economic impact ithas (we have a pretty interesting economy). If you read until here thank you and hope you have a great day!"
CryptoCurrency,"My Investor Psychology This post is kind of ranty, so my apologies in advance if my thoughts are a bit disorganized. 

The age-old question: should I sell? All indicators point to us entering a bear market (for however long) - selling now seems like a no brainer, right? But in my experience trading crypto over the last four years, I’ve gotten burned pretty much every move I make — sell to buy lower but price goes up, buy more before a pump that never happens, HODL through a 90% crash because you’re scared of the missing a relief pump that never happens — it’s all a bad move without the gift of hindsight. Day trading is honestly just a game of slots - I’m sure there are some people who make a living off of it, but I’d just call them professional gamblers. I don’t need that kind of stress.

My strategy now is simple - stake all my -insert coin here- to prevent me from panic selling and DCA weekly regardless of current price until I’m ready to sell at my target price. I’ve been holding my bags for too long to risk the next (in my opinion) inevitable bull run.

It’s not like I’m using this money anyway, so I honestly shouldn’t care if the $$$ amount goes up or down. I know others may not be in the same situation and maybe invested money that would really harm their lives if they lost it - but that’s the old saying right? Don’t invest what you can’t afford to lose. 🤡 

So, I’m just going to kick my feet up, watch the entire crypto space burn, watch my -insert coin here- amount go up from DCA and staking, and then start paying attention to the dollar amounts in the next cycle. As far as I’m concerned, I am happy to consider crypto as my Roth IRA account that I won’t see until I’m retiring at 65, decades from now. Even that much is okay with me, and still better than traditional investing opportunities. I believe in the fundamentals of -insert coin here- and eventually the fundamentals will become relevant again.

Hopefully my outlook helps those who are struggling psychologically with the recent downtrend.

Here are some bonus take-aways from my time in crypto:

1) don’t invest the money you need to buy food with or pay for your kids’ education with

2) invest only in coins whose fundamentals you’re excited by!

3) set up a weekly investing plan to DCA

4) 1 coin = 1 coin. USD amounts don’t matter if you weren’t planning on getting rich any time soon, anyway. Trust in the fundamentals of whatever coin(s) you’re excited by, and if the fundamentals end up not being all that great in the long run, well that’s just part of investing.

5) Stay away from shitcoin tokens unless you love losing money. Some people have made insane returns on meme coins but, believe me, the stress is not worth it. You’re basically playing a game of chicken with the inevitable rug."

CryptoCurrency,"World Crypto Life/IMC Token MLM/Ponzi? I'm seeing numerous people I know getting into this (including several in for at least 5 figures) so I started doing due diligence. The new COO is Chris Principe who runs Financial IT magazine and actively used it to promote OneCoin (even putting ""crypto queen"" Ruja Ignatova on the cover) and filed a lawsuit with them to attack someone exposing their massive ponzi scheme. Raymond Follmer appears to have ties to OneCoin as well, along with ties to Reverend Sheila who claims he scammed her. Francis Yoon's last 2 businesses (Epika Global and Emperor Global) appear to have been suspended and forfeited due to some sort of tax reasons, per public documents. Another new addition to their ""team"" is an influencer called Bitcoin Brandon. (Bitcoin) Brandon Ivey was involved with KryptoGeneX, along with Stephen McCullough (of SkyBiz ponzi fame), and promoted an educational scheme that was essentially just a modern revamp of SkyBiz. This is just what I've discovered so far from the team I'm aware of.

The website is shady

[www.imctoken.com](http://www.imctoken.com)

and the white paper is barely coherent.

[www.imctoken/whitepaper](http://www.imctoken/whitepaper)

There's an MLM structure for the promotion of the coin through World Crypto Life where you get bonuses and passive income through recruitment. They created their own exchange in order to sell their coin. Investment is locked up for 6 months and released in intervals to ""control price."" They tout an exclusive deal with Bank of America for a debit card but a further dive appears that deal was cut with IM Finservices, a side (parent?) company the lawyer created. Even though this is claimed exclusive by recruiters, there appears to be a parallel offer through [www.Cex-US.com](http://www.Cex-US.com) that also uses the same deal IM FinServices brokered so I don't think it's exclusive. Others have claimed BoA denies this partnership altogether but I can't speak to that part.

Can anyone provide more insight that might prove it's either legitimate or a scam? People don't seem phased by all these red flags and I'd love something more concrete to work with."

CryptoCurrency,"ETH 2.0, I can’t wait for it to get here We all know that gas fees on ETH are high. A lot of the pricing of ETH 2.0 will already be “baked in” when it goes live.

I do not think that the ETH 2.0 price for these tokens will be “baked in” and think that there will be more volatility in the ERC-20 market once it becomes a fraction of the price to buy and sell. I think that there will be more buying pressure than selling pressure in the immediately after the change, kind of like the Coinbase pump."

Here's why I believe it's going to introduce institutional money into crypto. **I am dumb and don't know anything about crypto. These are purely opinions I have and I'm typing this tired after work so take it with a grain of salt.** 

A discussion is happening tomorrow on [https://www.thebword.org/c/the-b-word](https://www.thebword.org/c/the-b-word), you can register to attend the launch of The B Word at 9 AM PDT, 7.21.21 and it will include key figures in the cryptocurrency space like **Jack Dorsey** (CEO of Square, Inc), **Cathie Wood** (Founder, CEO &amp; CIO of ARK Invest), **Elon Musk** (Technoking of Tesla and Chief Engineer of SpaceX), **Adam Back** (Co-Founder and CEO of Blockstream) and a few other more. 

The discussion will be focused on key thought leaders in the space explaining how institutions can embrace crypto, how to overcome the hurdles blockchain technologies have, and destigmatizing FUD-fueled narratives around it. It will be a good opportunity to highlight areas of support blockchain networks require, and finding a way for institutions to work collectively towards more adoption. 

I believe the discussion was fueled by a conversation that Jack, Cathie, and Elon had on Twitter. Here is a screenshot of it:

&amp;#x200B;

[Not the full thread, read the full one on Twitter if you can, it's interesting.](https://preview.redd.it/yqmwc3hxwdc71.png?width=1282&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=871b4926fb531c84d5cadbecafd3db46e2c44b73)

What could they be discussing at the event? I think Jack and Cathie will be explaining to Elon how Bitcoin mining can promote the use of renewable energy, specifically Elon's favorite, solar energy. Bitcoin will accelerate the renewable energy sector and fix grid congestion by offloading wasted energy into the networks. Cathie Wood has talked about this several times on Bloomberg, and she believes that Elon could help with this with his gigafactories and technology.  We've also seen a migration of Chinese miners into the US, specifically Texas. What else is in Texas? Tesla factories. We might be in for a discussion that could potentially fuel a massive geographical shift in mining hash rates, which would be extremely attractive for green mining.

Again, not trying to shill. Just presenting my opinions. But I'll be tuning in tomorrow."

CryptoCurrency,"The current crypto market cap of 1.18 trillion dollars is still higher than of 168 days ago - early February I am one of those who bought half of my crypto at ATH back in May, basically BTC and ETH and a couple others (looking at you ADA), and I have DCAed since. Looking at the current market of crypto may be a bit demotivating for some, but not for others, especially for those who have been here for a while. I didn't myself own any crypto until 2020, but I have always followed the stocks and crypto out of curiosity and I still remember when I heard BTC reaching $3K and I was a bit shocked.

From early February up until May, we went from about the current market cap of 1.18 trillion dollars to over 2.4 trillion dollars in a matter of a few months. Everyone was happy back then. Now we are in a point as same as we were in early Feb, although then some could say we  BTC was worth more than now ($33k in 2 Feb vs. $29k today), but if we go back exactly just one month, today's BTC value in dollars was the same as in January the second. 

How about ETH reaching an ATH of +4k dollars back in May? Its current value of $1.7k is still higher than that of just 168 days ago which was about $1.5k. 

The take here is we rose high and quick, and fell high and quick; the only difference is that more people have started investing in crypto than 168 days ago. if took only 168 days to go high and back to our place, where would we be in the next 168 days, lower, higher? No one knows, but since you are here you already know that, and if you are not day trading (god knows why would you), and you consider yourself a ""long term HODLer"", and then freak out in a time frame of about 4 months, that's not exactly long term..or hodling.

CryptoCurrency,"To all the new investors that might be wondering what’s going on?... Do not listen to anyone about what’s going to happen. Even me.... 

But what I can do is inform you on what Bitcoin halving does. 

As we just saw back in February/March, Bitcoin halved. What we saw next was the *Bull run* to 65k. We dropped back to 20k which was previous 2017 ATH. When we break the previous ATH, that’s when the run starts. ALWAYS! 


So people are going to tell you to buy or sell or whatever. Whatever you have invested, you should be comfortable with it being -85% for a year or two(alt coins). 


Now, Bitcoin will have all these small *dead cats* if that’s even what you want to call them. For the next 2 years. Then you will start to see Bitcoin gain attraction again(2023). 

We will have a halving then and once we break 65k(previous ATH) we start the next bull run. 


Now this is what the protocol is coded to do, so it’s literally a rinse and repeat process if you trade. If you HODL, just know it will probably take you about 3 bull runs to see a nice profit. 


But you need to think about this, can I double my money in a year? If yes, imagine how many *doubles* you need to hit 1M.

1. Person makes a confident prediction, they will usually back it up by usually saying past trends indicate this is correct.

2. (Outcome A) The prediction was incorrect. The person will move on and avoid acknowledging their prediction ever again, they will move onto their next prediction as a way of redeeming themselves.

2. (Outcome B) The prediction was correct. The person will now bring up this correct prediction to convince others that their next prediction is also correct. In many cases they will use this correct prediction as evidence of their infinite wisdom for years to come.

2. I can retire at 57 and receive a pension that would equate to roughly 41k with the current cost of living. This scenario leaves me 19 years of contributing 8k a year into a 401k.

Now to the fun part. I got turned onto crypto recently and absolutely believe that crypto will overtake fiat currency in my lifetime. After a modest initial investment, I have decided to DCA $100 a month into solid projects that offer staking rewards or pays me interest.

**So I bought 5 meme coins for $100 each** to find out whether these *comedic* coins are gonna survive the long run or not.  
**I didn't do any further research**, I only ruled out the obvious rug pulls and selected those 5 BSC tokens based on popularity in the past few days, weeks. These are **SafeMoon, Useless Token, Thoreum, Ping** and **CleanOcean.** 

&amp;#x200B;

**WEEK #1**

Not as bad as I thought. Keep in mind that not just some of these coins dipped but the whole market as well. The prices of these tokens were relatively stable (excluding Useless, which was almost profitable).

CryptoCurrency,"A Stablecoin Will Eventually Blow Up They are all competing with each other, trying to offer the best interest rates. Meanwhile they are chasing yield to pay it. 

Some hold half their assets in corporate debt.  I don’t know exactly how tight the margins are, but it’s only a matter of time before a corporate bond market event puts at least one of them out of business. 

That said, I don’t think this would spill over into Bitcoin. While everything is somewhat connected, Stablecoins are their own animal. I could even see a liquidation being the end of the bear market, as everyone will THINK that Bitcoin would suffer."
CryptoCurrency,"It's crazy to think that 3 months ago I was worried about figuring out taxes on crypto profits... It seems so long ago now. I was genuinely very concerned about how on earth I would figure out my crypto taxes when I'd traded in and out a few times on various different coins.

I was Googling capital gains tax, what counts as a taxable transaction, it was a 'problem' in my mind only three months ago.

Oh well, I guess nice to have one less problem to deal with."
CryptoCurrency,"Am I a big dumb stupidhead? Don't answer that. Brief background on me as I think it's necessary to answer my question - I'm new to crypto and new to any and all TA and really anything stock market related. I have, however, immersed myself very deeply in crypto ever since I got started in early June of this year. My brain is no sponge but I'm still dipping that thing into as much crypto knowledge as possible to soak up every last little bit I'm capable of and will continue to do so. I follow several credible YouTubers that follow crypto as well as on Reddit. I created a Twitter account solely for crypto where I follow absolutely nothing non-crypto related. I've targeted a couple crypto projects I truly am interested in and believe in after much research and pool some funds into that while DCAing into ETH, BTC and a couple other alt coins. I don't currently day trade or anything of the sort but eventually I might dabble just a bit for fun. I'm largely in it for the long haul but wouldn't mind some short term gains to pay off this or that.

That said, it goes without saying that all the crypto nerds I follow and all the research I do yields quite a bit of bearish news/opinions especially these days. Everyone always stresses ""Hey, just hodl, DCA in, buy the dips and chill"" or something to that effect, which I am absolutely doing. We all know the paper hands out there are shockingly prevalent and to ignore those silly folks and all the weirdos that sell at the lowest of dips - the same people who bought BTC at 60k wishing they had bought at 35k and now that we're at 30k they're bitching out and won't buy.

Allllll of this and the inevitable FUD has me entirely unphased and not because I have some superior knowledge of the market and where it's going based on TA and historic trends and this and that. Clearly I don't. Rather, I'm unphased because I've decided in my short time in crypto that I absolutely, truly, without a doubt believe in the blockchain technology and believe DeFi is absolutely the thing of the future. Apart from that belief I also absolutely want it to be true. I am willing it to be so, damnit.

My question is - am I a foolish turd for not being AS phased by all this crazy movement and volatility and people freaking out? All of this craziness I see day-to-day where some YouTubers might let out a big uncharacteristic sigh before addressing the latest dip or act all poo-pooed when reciting some recent news from credible sources doesn't seem to matter all that much to me. Should it? Should it matter at all to me if ultimately I truly believe all of this will be not even a blip on the crypto radar in years to come as it becomes widely adopted? Am I stoopid or just a proper believer?"

CryptoCurrency,"EU to tighten rules on cryptoasset transfers Companies that transfer bitcoin or other cryptoassets must collect details of senders and recipients to help authorities crack down on dirty money, EU policymakers proposed on Tuesday in the latest efforts to tighten regulation of the sector.

The law proposed by the European Commission, the EU executive, would apply what is known as the travel rule to crypto transactions to make them traceable.


The rule, which is one of the recommendations of the inter-governmental watchdog, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), already applies to wire transfers.

""Today’s amendments will ensure full traceability of crypto-asset transfers, such as bitcoin, and will allow for prevention and detection of their possible use for money laundering or terrorism financing,"" the Commission said in a statement.

A company handling cryptoassets for a customer must include the customer's name, address, date of birth and account number, and the name of the person who will receive the cryptoassets.

The recipient's service provider must also check if any of the required information is missing.

Providing anonymous crypto-asset wallets will also be prohibited, just as anonymous bank accounts are already banned under EU anti-money laundering rules.

""These proposals have been designed to find the right balance between addressing these threats and complying with international standards while not creating excessive regulatory burden on the industry,"" the European Commission said.

""On the contrary, these proposals will help the EU crypto-asset industry develop, as it will benefit from an updated, harmonised legal framework across the EU.""

EU states and the European Parliament have the final say on the proposals, meaning it could take two years for them to become law."

CryptoCurrency,"Random coin that turned out successful My father Bought Crypton in mid-2020 at $313 he bought it from one of his Army friend's Son who insisted and told him to buy it. My father lives away from us so we only came to know around last month when he wanted my brothers' help to encash them partly as he remembered that he did buy CRP last year and forgot about it. His profit is not millions. It was around 5 digits lmao. Now my family gathered together so we can celebrate this success. To be honest, I never believe in the get-rich scheme that crypto offers. I still believe working 9-5 would be the right way to earn money. Looking at it now, just buying a random coin and let it sit for months can change your life drastically.

CryptoCurrency,"Crypto for Purchases I read an article at some point in the six months that I can’t find anymore about a gentleman who bought a house using his crypto. I don’t remember what it was, but as I’m looking at houses myself it got me thinking, how would you do this? I remember in the article he talked about jumping through hoops to verify his funds were valid, but he didn’t convert to fiat, therefore wasn’t having to deal with a “sale” and paying taxes on profits. I also have read posts on here that talk about capital gains might still apply to whatever you “made” as the coins increase in value/price (depending on how you define each term). Which just leaves me perplexed. Does anyone know the article I’m referencing? Is it actually possible to basically force your way into paying for things with crypto? If so, how might one would go about doing this? 

Disclaimer: this is a just question of curiosity, as I don’t own enough to buy a house. Maybe a little tikes play house. But that’s it."
CryptoCurrency,"BTC Long and Short Term TA - Do you HODL or GCG (Go Cash Gang)? First of all, I should mention that I have BTC, ETH and ADA and I'll be hodling long term. Second, crypto is about 15% of my investment portfolio, and diversification is critical to any long term investment strategy. Third, I'm using some eyeball trendlines to begin this analysis, and there will be no fancy patterns, but there will be some machine learning (ML) and predictive analytics later.

This all started a week ago, when I realized a distinct bear market forming with a slow but steady declining pattern in BTC chart in the last 3 weeks or so. Then I decided to run some ML algorithm I built for stock analysis and saw that the model was predicting below $30,000 price action in the next 10 days. (This analysis was done Friday). As of this writing, the BTC price indeed fell below that . I decided to not heed the model predictions because another TA I did earlier was showing a great support at $31,000 and I honestly didn't think it would fall below that. Now that we are below that the short term BTC became really bearish. But long term I'm still bullish, not because of any specific tweet, but because of what the chart is telling me. Here is the explanation:

&amp;#x200B;

[BTC - All time logarithmic chart](https://preview.redd.it/v126ersx6dc71.png?width=1058&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f150048ff46fb335dc08aa0c078826c743eabb7f)

If you look at BTC all time chart you can clearly see the exponential ascending trend . In the chart if we look at the channel, we can also see the overbought territory on late 2017 and underbought region in early 2020. That is where you should have bought BTC. If you FOMO'ed like me in 2021, tough luck, because the new support is not forming till \~$22,000. In the short term the price may consolidate till September. If you have been DCA'ing keep doing it, but I really don't see an upside if you enter the bear market with a large lump sum. Why is the long term bullish? Because if we actually bounce back from that support and remain in the channel, then this baby is gonna go to $100,000 by the end of 2022 or early [2023.](https://2023.Now) 

Now let's look at very short term price predictions. For that, we utilize ML (or buzzzword AI, if you want to sound fancy). I actually used a technique called Elastic Net, which is super simple so calling it AI is an insult to data science community. Anyhow, here we give the machine a bunch of features, like, the open/close/high/low prices for the day for the past history and ask the machine to learn the patterns and then predict the future prices.

&amp;#x200B;

[BTC 10 day prediction](https://preview.redd.it/qwao4ljvpdc71.png?width=648&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=58162c4e214f4c206755e79465132193f46e6dc7)

In the above figure, you'll see that the blue line is the historic prices, and the orange line is the future predictions. As you can also see, as of this morning, the machine is predicting a steep downward trend in the next 10 days, and also predicting a price range of $26,000. 

Based on this prediction I'll stop my DCA strategy for the short term and wait to see some bounce back before jumping in again.

TL,DR: Bear market dudes. If you're DCA'ing, grrreat. Don't jump in with large sum. It will potentially consolidate towards $22,000. Next 10 days can be brutal, wait for an upswing. Long term, bullish as heck. $100,000 in the next year and a half.

CryptoCurrency,"It's not the ""Whales and Institutions"". Market sentiment is real, and crypto does not entertain similar confidence that traditional investments do. This David vs Goliath mindset sets in during bear markets because we all need someone to blame. Price falls do not mean that some big bad wolf is pulling strings in the background. In fact, the very reason that crypto is an appealing investment (1000% gains?), is exactly the same reason that we dip HARD in bear markets.

As of right now, Bitcoin market cap is right around $550B. If Bitcoin were a company, it would be solidly in the top 10 of the S&amp;P 500. If you take BTC and ETH together, they would be fighting for a slot with Google for #5 based off valuations [from last month](https://www.investopedia.com/top-10-s-and-p-500-stocks-by-index-weight-4843111). 

BTC isn't a company, and ownership doesn't have the same implications (or restrictions) as ownership of stock, but we are still taking about MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF MONEY. Its hard for ""Whales and Institutions"" to influence the price significantly. Additionally, anyone who is buying up crypto in super large sums in this day and age is a sophisticated investor. Sophisticated investors are very mindful of risk, and they are not likely to take a bath on their crypto portfolio to add a few more BTC or ETH for the long term. They may re allocate a few times a year, but I think it's unlikely they are letting a bunch of capital reserves sit idly while they try and manipulate the price all the way to the bottom. They have a plan, and that plan probably relies upon their long-term outlook for the investment, with pre-determined levels for taking profit or cutting losses. Groups who (maybe) have the ability to manipulate the market, are  not reckless with a volatile asset.

At the end of the day we all need to know what we are investing in, and why we are doing it. I strongly believe in crypto tech, but I also recognize the risks involved. Manipulation in an asset this large is not  impossible, but don't convince yourself that is the only reason for dips such as the one we are seeing. Bear markets happen for a variety of reasons, but make sure you know what the most likely of those are. Try not to find a scapegoat, but instead think critically about the market pressures that lead to this. It'll make you a better investor long term.

TLDR: Know what you are investing in."
CryptoCurrency,"Heikin-Ashi analysis and the future outlook of Crypto Hi all,

Has anyone used Heiken-Ashi candlestick patterns in their trading strategy for crypto? I'm considering using a mixture of DCA for continued investing and Heiken-Ashi for putting bigger bids on in lows, but wonder what folks' experiences have been.

When I look at the 1 Month Heiken-Ashi for BTC I'm seeing  the start of a potential Crypto winter as the RSI is just hitting 70.

When I look at the 1 Week Heiken-Ashi I'm seeing two Bearish signals and next week is looking likely to either be a confirmation of another Bear cycle or another consolidation phase - a sustained upswing doesn't appear likely.

The 1 Day Heiken-Ashi also indicates a Bearish cycle start, but the RSI is right around 30 indicating a good time to buy - potentially a few days of stagnancy/consolidation.

Anyway, looking at several time spans and historical data of Heiken-Ashi to me it seems like a the Bear cycle will continue with potential of a Crypto winter. But 2021 is not the same as 2013 or 2017. Perhaps with Crypto gaining more mainstream traction and technologies getting increasingly more advanced maybe a Crypto winter is unlikely.

I'm currently researching about ***what are the factors that could influence investors' perception of cryptocurrency investment and their decision in investing in Bitcoin.*** I am building my conceptual framework and I really need help with the variables related to Economic factors. 

Based on the existed literature review, I spotted that some suggested investing in crypto can be an *""alternative"" for savings as well as a portfolio diversification tool.* However, these have not been proved in the context of investors' perception of crypto investment.

The black and white “tuxedo” look donned by most penguin species is a clever camouflage called countershading.

CryptoCurrency,"A description of bitcoin - I've been studying for a few months, is this a good description of what bitcoin is and how it works? Bitcoin is a distributed ledger that is split into blocks which are sent to nodes who save it and store it. Each block is simply a bunch of transactions from wallets. A block is generated every 10 minutes by miners who perform hash functions to achieve the target difficulty. 

When the block is hashed by the miners it uses sha-256 encryption which is a 1 way cryptographic function which turns any length of data into a 64 digit hash key (256 bits). The hash of the previous block is also included in the header of the current block to allow you to go back and verify the order of blocks and to also make it increasingly harder for anyone to go back and change past transactions. 

The miners hash the contents of the block but if the resulting hash isn't equal or lower than the target they try again increasing the nonce. The nonce is simply a number used once which is added to the block to see if it matches the target, if it doesn't the miners try the next number. The first miner to hash the block with the correct nonce that results in a hash below or equal to the target is rewarded with bitcoins. The miner who wins is allowed to publish the block and all the other nodes on the network store it. 

The rewards are decreased every 4 years to maintain a stock to flow model similar to physical gold, by the year 2140 there will be no more rewards given out. The difficulty for mining is also increased (or decreased) every 2016 blocks (about 2 weeks) to accommodate for changing total hash power of the entire bitcoin network, this is to ensure that a block is produced every 10 minutes on average. 

The changing of difficulty is simply the amount of 0's at the start of the hash target for miners. If you don't want to mine bitcoin to acquire it you must go to an exchange and buy it from someone who wants to sell it for fiat money. When you own bitcoins it is stored in a wallet on the network with the entire history of your bitcoins being traceable to when they were first mined.

Your wallet is only kept safe by only you knowing your keys to your wallet, if anyone else has access to them then they essentially have your bitcoins. You can own a hardware wallet which stores your keys offline and never leaves the device to ensure maximum safety.

Many people mistakingly think that bitcoin is anonymous but in reality it is pseudo anonymous as everything is public just without your real name. As long as you never share your wallet address online with identifying information like you name no one can know who owns your wallet, but they can still see your balance and every transaction you have made.

Please let me know if there's anything I have missed."
CryptoCurrency,"Strategies for regular purchasing during a downward trend It's not a bad idea to place multiple limit orders with increasing purchase amount downwards, especially if the coin shows a decreasing trend. It'll not only lower your purchase average but also make you a bit happy while travelling downwards!

Yesterday I suggested this approach to somebody I hope he followed. (Original post link is in the comments below)

Asking regular coin buyers, what is your strategy for purchase? Auto DCA at market price? Or, ""all in"" limit order just below the current price (some exchanges like Kraken reward that as you are a market maker not taker), or multiple equal sized/differing packages downward?

Fast forward to December of 2020 and I became interested again. I managed to learn about Coinbase and Bittrex and bought my first coins there. I was enamored with the idea and the way that it worked.

At first, I really liked the ease of use and being part of a financial system that I think will go on to challenge traditional sectors in finance.

CryptoCurrency,"If you prayed for a dip in prices so you could buy MOAR crypto this may be your opportunity to do so. If you got spooked and sold well.... you know who you are 📜🙌📜 All I used to hear was I wish I got into BTC at 10k, 20k, 30k, etcetera, but how many of you who expressed that desire actually increased your positions? It's fine either way, you do you either buy the dip or don't, sell or dont sell, that's all your decision, but don't dump your coins while literally everything is down from stocks, to crypto, to precious metals... it's all down over the last couple months. Sure crypto has taken a beating but we all knew the volatility or should have known.

Full disclosure I am not a financial advisor so take this with a grain of salt the size of the moon we so eagerly shoot for, but imo this absolutely is the opportunity that so many of you wanted while BTC was at its all time high so take advantage before prices rebound. Or maybe this game isn't for you. Some people simply can't handle the volatility 🤷‍♂️ which is why you shouldn't invest anything in crypto that your not willing to lose 100% right now. That may change in the future with stablecoins but that's another discussion.

MOON is good for privacy, not connected to any users profile. 

Works with any Ethereum apps.

We (users) own and control MOON. Reddit will release 50 million MOON to the r/CryptoCurrency community. 

You earn MOON by being active on this sub, you can be tipped MOON or receive MOON via karma points.

A set number of MOON is distributed per month, a portion is kept for the moderators of the CryptoCurrency group, for managing the group.

VAULT is where your MOON balance is kept and can be spent. 

VAULT generates a public address and a private key, Reddit has access to the public address to view balance and send rewards to users.

VAULT can be accessed through mobile Reddit application

I know if you hold your MOON in your VAULT an do not withdraw them, (on a monthly basis), you get a reward, not sure on the percentage of that reward, any input and comments to make users understand MOON more would be perfect.

CryptoCurrency,"The 6 first parachains on Kusama (an Ethereum like) have been chosen and are deployed! It's done! 

The first 5 auctions of Kusama came to an end! So far 6 parachains are live on Kusama (a blockchain platform or a relay network as they call it). They already are producing blocks and one of them even distributed its native token to the backers of the crowdloan.  


The  first parachains which have launch on Kusama are : 

1. **Statemine** (a parachain designed to help other parachains to deploy different types of asset. This one was integrated outside of the auctions for being a common-good parachain)
2. **Karura** : A Dex with a stablecoin, a liquid virtual KSM asset and a native token called KAR which has been distributed to their backers of the crowdloan (now added on Kraken, since about now). 
3. **Moonriver** : an ethereum virtual machine and a set of tools for developers to deploy their blockchains on Kusama, or bridge their assets there.
4. **Shiden** : Brings smart contracts to Kusama and should also bring bridges to ethereum but not only.
5. **Phala** : Private and confidential network. Provides confidential smart contracts. 
6. **Bifrost** : A Dex which also has a virtual KSM type of asset. Let's see how it plays out between Karura and Bifrost in the future.

&amp;#x200B;

To win an auction, projects get KSM from people who want to back them through a crowdloan. They bid the amount of KSM they received  during an auction to get a slot on Kusama as a parachain. Once the slot won, the amount of KSM is locked for 48 weeks. Backers usually receive some rewards in the form of the native tokens of the parachain they helped obtaining a slot, to offset the opportunity cost of not staking their KSM.

around  1.07 Million KSM have been locked so far on the network via the auctions, for 48 weeks, which is around 10% of the KSM supply!  


The Kusama team will check if the network and the parachains are running smoothly, and if they do, a second batch of auction is coming for mid august! 5 new parachain slots will be auctioned so it's possible to help and get in on 5 new projects.

CryptoCurrency,"DCA for beginners DCA is an oversaturated acronym so to help beginners here is what it means.

DCA acronym:  
Dollar Cost Average. Sometimes also called [Cost Basis](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/costbasis.asp).   
Basically this is the average cost of the share or coin after multiple transactions and returns.  
Example:  
$100 for 100 coins @ $1  
$100 for 200 coins @ $.50  
DCA = $.66 per coin ($200 / 300 coins)  
Note: to determine your break even point you will want to add any fees to the transactions as well.

DCA Strategy: [Dollar-Cost Averaging](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dollarcostaveraging.asp).   
Time IN the market opposed to timeING the market.  
This is a **scheduled purchase** of an asset **regardless of price**. Sometimes you'll buy more, sometimes you'll buy less. It helps mitigate risk by breaking up your investment so you don't YOLO at what you think is a good price just to watch it fall out from under you.  
Note: Sometimes people will wait for a ""red day"" to spend their scheduled budget.

DCA Redit/Social media verb:  
""Woo hoo! Flash sale, time to DCA!!!1!!""  
Basically just shorthand for, ""Don't worry about this 50% crash 'ol chap! if you have the money to spend without getting hurt, you can buy more and lower your Dollar Cost Average. Once the price (hopefully) recovers it will be far easier to take profits or dump the coin if you don't believe in the project! since your break even point will be easier to reach."""

""Buy the dip"".

No.

We had a bull market. It crashed. Now we are in a bear market.

How do you call a 50% drop? It is for sure not a small dip, neither a health correction. It is a crash.

Its understandable, a lot of people bought only recently and some of them -unlucky ones- bought the very peak. Thats ok. You will get your money back. But it wont be tomorrow. Maybe it wont even be this years. But thats ok.

You are in crypto for the long run. Bitcoin will hit 1m. When? Eventually. At current prices that 1m will be more like 400k but thats good too.

The bulls will come back, do not worry. But it wont be tomorrow and it wont be today.

We are in a BEAR market.

I personally dont think it will be as bad as last one. The post2018 winter was very hard for all of us. It was the first bear market for many, myself included. But we knew it was just a matter of time. Bulls will come back.

CryptoCurrency,"I might get liquidated for a loan that I'll be able to close in 2 days once I get my salary! Let me begin by saying that I am an investor and not a trader. So when I talk about liquidation and leverage I am talking about crypto loans and not margin trading.

So here's the story. I personally needed some money for personal expenses (not necessarily an emergency) but dd not want to sell my positions away. That is when I came across the lending platform [coinrabbit.io](https://coinrabbit.io/) which provides instant loans without KYC (I am not affiliated with them in any way and am just a customer). This seemed like a good way to profit from some gains without cashing out. I put my Nano as collateral and received the loan amount in 5 mins.

Unfortunately for me, they have a one month penalty (if you close your loan within one month of availing, you'll have to pay an extra fee). So I decided to pay off the loan after 32 days (which would help me avoid the extra fee).

I had not expected the crypto market to drop today and I am two days away from the 32 day limit when I was planning on closing my loan. Fortunately as I am new to taking crypto loans **I only put at risk what I could afford to lose**. Furthermore, I have a lot of spare nano on the side so I increased my deposit amount which saved me from getting liquidated (for now). Just for some context, in the morning a 5% drop in Nano price would have gotten me liquidated. Fortunately now I have 2 days and it would take a 33% drop in price for the same liquidation to happen (based on market sentiment this can still happen).

**Based on my experience with crypto loans, here are the main precautionary insights I can share**:

1. **Make sure the platform you are using is reliable** and not a rug pull. With new platforms starting everyday it is very hard to judge whether your money is parked in a safe place or not. I had heard good things about coinrabbit and they claim no rehypothecation so that gave me some peace of mind.
2. Make sure the crypto asset you choose as collateral is reliable enough. The incentive to choose Nano was instant loan release because of Nano's speed and fee-less nature. **I made a mistake by choosing Nano as collateral**. Because of its low market cap it is highly volatile. Even bitcoin is unreliable in a bear market.
3. **Taking a loan out on your crypto essentially means you are trying to time the market.** This is because you are hoping the prices don't drop enough in the short term to get you in a vulnerable position. This is definitely a high risk play with limited upside.
4. **Don't take a crypto loan to buy more crypto.** If you take out a loan to buy crypto, you are essentially exposing yourself to the risks of a margin trader. Everything follows BTC and ETH anyway so you are doubling your risks if you buy crypto with your loan amount.
5. Take measures to prevent liquidation. Some common ways to do it would be to **not take a loan on your entire crypto asset and instead save 50% or more in case of a severe price drop**. Depositing more coins later would drop the liquidation price and keep you afloat for a few more days at least.
6. **Have a strong source of income that you can use to pay off the loan** according to the timelines comfortable to you. Make sure you realise that if you are unable to pay off your loan then your collateral is stuck forever and the interest would keep piling up. Just like a credit card loan. 
7. Worst case scenario, **you get liquidated or are unable to pay off the loan. How would your life change?** This is the most important question to answer even before thinking about taking a loan based on your risk appetite and general financial condition. If getting liquidated would put you on the streets or if you are putting years of life savings as collateral, then maybe you need to rethink this and concentrate on the worst case scenario.

**Tldr;** Crypto loans still have a long way to go because of the volatility of the market and high correlation to BTC. Think carefully before taking one. It is very different from taking mortgage on your real estate property. In the future, we might start seeing less interest rates and more stability which would make this viable for everyone."

Correct it did.

Obviously this requires research and a sound thesis - I wouldn’t touch meme coins or anything else that’s pure speculative nonsense right now unless you’re like in the fringes of your risk curve knowingly.

CryptoCurrency,"Do you think the recent price dip was really a market crash? I'm doubtful that this was just a normal market fluctuation Call me paranoid, but I believe foul play was involved. The inflation and price drop was not what a correction should be. Whales strike again and are frankly just straight up destroying the market. We absolutely NEED platforms and companies like the upcoming Genesis Pool (gpoolofficial on telegram for anyone interested) that have zero tolerance for this whale crap.
It's frankly really frustrating because normal people simply don't have a chance, What makes it different than the rigged stock market then? Isn't this why crypto was made in the first place? To get away from all the shady practices that take away from the little guy?"

CryptoCurrency,"Research Participants Needed Hi everyone,

I'm an postgrad student at the University of Bristol in England and, for my dissertation, I'm exploring how employees perceive blockchain technology and its future use within supply chains. As part of this, I’m looking to interview people whose jobs involve interacting with supply chains in some shape or form (so anyone who delivers, takes delivery of, or manages stock/raw materials; IT staff who manage stock systems; supply chain managers and senior managers who manage supply chain employees; and so on). 

It doesn’t matter if you have no idea what blockchain is, or if you’re a bona fide expert - I’m interested in your opinion.

The interview should take around 45 minutes to an hour to complete. Participant information will be provided beforehand, and all data will be handled in accordance with the University of Bristol ethics and GDPR policies. I'm more than happy to provide proof of authenticity upon request, in addition to my use of a university email address.

Please do send me a message if you’re interested in taking part!

I've been following it quite closely since i own a decent bagg off xrp. To me it's obvious that ripple is making sure the Sec will not be able to bully any more legit crypto into giving them money. 

They could just save their own asses but don't. Probably because they see the Importance off this case and the legal clarity it could bring to crypto as a whole.

Since the last few updates i'm feeling incredibly optimistic in their chances off squashing the Sec and setting a good legal precedent for future cases.

CryptoCurrency,"Non Fungible Bitcoin Hello, I want to show you my own coin idea based on my thoughts from few years and show an example as simple as possible of what I'm trying to make.

First of all, I want to create a coin that will be similar to NFT tokens but in basics, it will be mineable so need to adjust few things.

a) Each coin will be serialized with its own letters like AA AA AA AA 

b) Each coin will be made from 4 pieces, and each piece is based on two letters

c) Miners will be mining those pieces instead of full coins.

Now after you mine few pieces there will be a few conditions that need to be met:

a) The full serialized coin can be made only from 4 pieces 

b) Each piece will have a hidden sign for example AAa

c) To form a full Non Fungible coin You need to have pieces with the same hidden sign for example:

AAa aAAb bAAc cAA

d) coins will be formed in alphabetical orders 

There will be a need to trade pieces to gain full coins or if you are enough luck You can mine pieces that will match and you will get a full coin.

I'm still considering algorithm for it but one is sure it will be 100% PoW and like 15 seconds block time.

The main thing is that I post it here because I want to see the opinions of the community and maybe some ideas on how to form my Idea in a good coin.

Was thinking about a usecase but the main thing is that each coin will be different and maybe implementation to sign under coin things like under NFT so art pictures etc and maybe ownership of other things.  

Waiting for Your opinion."

If you look at the history of all time lows to all time highs on so many of these coins you will find that most of them after their all time lows rebounded almost 1500% or more to the new low of today's cost. Coins like amp vtho sand shibainu all are much higher then their lows.HODL.....

Doesn't anyone else see the scared fish trying to jump out of the pool. All you are doing is allowing big whales to buy up supply at low prices because you're intimidated over news about how cryptocurrency is a scam. 

My buddy came to me yesterday and showed me this news report of someone who has made millions. One of the founders of ethereum co founders says millionaires are making money off bitcoin and other coins. Well let's think about this dont they already do that to us in the stock market.

Bigger money means bigger gains. So while they're scaring all the small fish out of the pool, the fish are gonna have to pay 2 to 10x times more for the coins once these whales buy all the coin.

CryptoCurrency,"Can someone explain how to “leverage against your crypto assets”? I’m not looking to margin trade or whatever but I heard a phrase and I’m curious how to do it with my crypto assets. The phrase was “the rich have learned to leverage against their assets”, the example was in real estate 🏡. 
My thought was using something like Celsius and getting a Loan against my assets inorder to invest. At the time of writing Cardano is around 1.10 so buying some of that seems like it would make money back. 
Is this the wrong way to think of it? Could someone better explain it to me?"
CryptoCurrency,"Let's talk: Binance burned $ 393 million of BNB, where is the growth? 🤨 Let's talk: Binance burned $ 393 million of BNB, where is the growth? 🤨

&amp;#x200B;

Burning tokens is believed to increase the price, but there are a number of important caveats:

▪️ It works in the long term, less supply on the market = higher rate.

▪️ The scarcity of an asset determines not only its quantity on the market, but also the availability of demand. So far, Binance is doing well, there will be demand for BNB 😉

▪️ Burns, upgrades, partnerships and other good news work great in a bull market, while it is still paused.

&amp;#x200B;

During the previous burning in April, $ 595 million worth of tokens were destroyed. Analysts are in a hurry to tell about a significant decrease in the exchange's income, because according to the procedure, coins equal to 20% of the income will be destroyed.

&amp;#x200B;

One could not wait for the burning, but just look at the trading volumes, which fell significantly in June and continue to decline in July."

One comment simply said “sounds good man, see you tomorrow”

Brilliant and funny but why fight it, just do it, check it and do as you please"
CryptoCurrency,"Learn to sit on those impatient hands, patience pays. I posted this in the daily and realized this is larger advice that many people in here should see.

If you haven't learned anything within the past 2-3 months, go do yourself the favor of taking 10min to study the chart movement of the past 2-3 months.

In summary, this game is not played on the 1min charts. Downwards movement can be planned out over the course of many, many months (or years, see: 2018). The market movers that have ran/manipulated markets for decades know how to keep people interested (see: every other comment in this sub for the past 3 months of buy the ""dip""). They know how to get people to keep buying allllll the way to the bottom as they laugh to the bank and buy back in at prices that are substantially lower.

Look at the macro level outside of crypto. The world markets have just started a downturn due to many different reasons. This has JUST started. When these markets take a shit, crypto will follow. Not every single red candle on the 1min chart is an ideal buying opportunity. Let things play out, stay patient, and you can buy in at lower prices.

Sure, the whales are buying now. Those same whales also bought at $60k. On the other hand, whales are ALSO doing the selling right now. These whales have essentially infinite money, where their crypto investments can go to shit or be held for years on end, while they continue to make millions upon billions from other sources. 

The vast majority of people in this sub are overinvested, and a 70-90% loss over the course of years is a hard pill to swallow. Sure, no one can time the bottom, but I'd sure rather start my DCA within lets say 20% of it vs 60% above it. 

Staying patient pays. As much as we want this thing to run up, be real with yourself. Because pure denial and ignorance to where the market is trending is only hurting yourself."
CryptoCurrency,"Building crypto not fiat. Dunno how your managing the dip but my technique right not is don’t look at the fiat value. Sure not the wisest move if you’ve over invested or are looking for short term gains but my thoughts are this , ATH get beat once in a while at sone pint , I’ve found a couple cryptos I like and after doing my own research come to a value to which I’ll sell , now as my
Portfolio drops in value I pay as little attention to the fiat value and concentrate on increase the amount of coinage. I use staking and every know and the when I have extra cash I use fiat to buy a few , always keeping the same sell value in mind. Hope this helps.’ Be safe guys mental health is important."
CryptoCurrency,"Bulls vs Bears - Tribalism is here, grab your jerseys and pick a side... Fighting in the blue corner we have the Bears, adamant it's all downhill from here and we are well and truly in a bear market.

Fighting in the red corner we have the Bulls, confidently claiming this bull run is not over and the sky is the limit.

Over to our sports correspondant, Melon Husk, to give us all the live updates. The only thing we know for sure, is that we actually don't know anything about what the future holds.

As if we didn't need anything else to divide people and cause more tribal alignment camps, we can now happily argue over where we know the market is going, because after all, we are financial advisors at market analysts.

CryptoCurrency,It took me several cycles to realize crypto is here to stay Since 2010 I've missed out or half invested in several cycles just to bail and when the bear market hit. Thinking it was either the end of crypto or selling at a large loss. I will not be doing this again as I've regretted it each and every time. I have no reason to believe this time will be any different. Even if you're sick of crypto and holding a bag - averaging down will get you out of your hole quicker. DCA'ing is the most responsible way going about it. Good luck everyone.

CryptoCurrency,"➡️ Building Resilient Economies with token economics | Econteric.com  

We need to build resilient economies because we are designing systems to be run by a decentralised community. The economy needs to be resilient because there is no ""off switch"" to press like there is in a centralised governing community.

The more resilient an economy is, the safer that economy is.

# People, Systems, Civilisation

Systems that we design are propagated by simplifying all the complexity down into some basic rules.

A question that needs to be answered is: “resilience to what and for whom?” Making something resilient is going to impact something else as there are always trade-offs in systems.

People are adaptable to situations such as disasters. What we are doing is to build adaptive systems that capture people’s adaptability. It is tougher to build resilient systems purely from the engineering perspective because they might not be able to account for the changing environment. We call these incomplete contracts economic.

However, we can add aspects of resilience or adaptability into the design of a system or economics. For example, pairing machines to aggregate data with humans, who can make better decisions based on the mountain of data. The biggest benefit is to create these adaptable systems to take advantage of the strength of both machines and people.

Machines can make some decisions or aggregate decisions to turn qualitative or quantitative stuff into a more digestible format. Humans are great at adapting the information produced. Machines and humans can work together to leverage the best of both strengths."
CryptoCurrency,"When the market is down post and comment to cover your losses with moons Always remember that any losses you suffer from investing in crypto can be made up by farming moons.

When the market is in a bloodbath start posting your frustration to this sub, if you post enough you might just make back some of them losses through moons! 

When the market is red farm moons instead!"
CryptoCurrency,"Don’t buy yet. Trying to time the bottom is extremely hard. Everyone and their nan is out giving advice on what investors, their postal delivery person, and family dog should do right now.

**This is my take: don’t buy anything yet. Do not try to time the bottom and buy the dips. Wait for the rebound and then buy in on the way up.**

It’s extremely hard to time the bottom of markets and cryptos are even harder to do this task. There is normal volatility in cryptos, but things are more intense with:

- inflation fears
- COVID-19 recovery/variants
- government regulations
- past pumps/dumps situations (Elon shitting on BTC and pumping Doge/China dumping mining/etc.)

It’s not so important to buy in at the absolute bottom. You’ll feel better if you wait for the drop to fully happen and the markets to rebound, as opposed to buying in and seeing a loss of 20% on what you thought was the bottom.

**When buying in, do so sparingly.**
Don’t spend whatever money you have all at once. Pretend you’re dating someone new and it’s the first time they cooked dinner. You don’t slam you face into the plate and swallow it all in one go - you nibble at the sides and eat sparingly as you figure out how to lie to them and tell them it tastes amazing. When you are buying in do it incrementally.

**Set stop losses/plan a way out/take profits**
Nobody here cares how big your gonads are. You have nothing to prove to anyone. Yes, you may have read about a random internet person riding crypto waves while you were still spilling food on yourself as you ate. So? Plan a way out so that you can leave when the risks-reward ratio becomes too much for you. You have nothing to prove to anyone. Walking away with a healthy profit is better than having invested all you can and eating canned ramen noodles everyday for weeks."
CryptoCurrency,"How I know we're in a bear market Up until a few weeks ago, almost every single post in here was about EOY predictions or how were only halfway through this bull run. But now, almost every post is about HODLing or reminders of what the price was 3 years ago, as if this makes people feel better about buying at the top.

""When in doubt, zoom out"".....the people saying this daily are  the same people who said BTC will be $100k EOY so buy more. ETH 10k so buy the dip, ADA $3 SO BUY THE FUCKING DIP

Every single influencer has revealed themselves to be full of shit and incapable of making accurate price predictions. They  shill coins that they hold and dump when you buy into their hype.

Zooming out brings little comfort to people who are down 50-90%, but it is a reminder that you need to HODL. Blockchain technology is great and will revolutionise our financial system and bring so much more usage and application to the internet, so buy into good projects. 

Be honest with yourself; you lack the skill, time and discipline to trade or make decisions on technical analysis. Do your research. Thoroughly! Don't just check a few videos of people shilling a project and telling you what you want to hear. Read the white paper. Make a decision on if the project has a real world use and if the team is dedicated. If you can't do this or don't know how: learn before you buy anything

Zooming out shows you that the biggest gains were made by HODLing over 5+ years. So, since we're in a bear market: buy, stake, HODL and thank yourself in 5 years time

TLDR: 
DCA, HODL, be happy in the meantime"
CryptoCurrency,"Top 100 coins/tokens by market cap and the most popular hot wallets that support them. Atomic, Exodus, and Trust wallet support most of these and that’s easily searchable. I put together a list of hot wallets applications that these communities recommended/use the most that are not Atomic, Exodus, or Trust. Granted, a multi asset wallet may be the best choice for certain assets.

A few things to keep in mind. At this point we all know that cold storage on a hardware wallet is the safest way to store your crypto. That being said, hot wallet applications do serve a purpose and there are many to choose from. 

I personally believe a native or official wallet is the best choice when available. There is no single wallet that will serve all purposes. (Governance, staking, defi, etc)

It is important to understand that your wallet is actually your private key or seed phrase, wallet applications allow you access and manage your cryptocurrency. You can import your seed phrase to other wallet applications that support the crypto you are trying to access. Any wallet that supports the Ethereum blockchain can hold any Erc-20 token. Some applications support multiple chains for coins/tokens. 

Always double check which chain you are using. 

Any storage method is only as secure as your safety practices. It’s up to you to secure your assets.

This is not a complete list of every wallet or every crypto. This is a list of the most popular assets in the top 100 and the most used/recommended wallet applications excluding Exodus, Atomic, and Trust. 

Please let me know if I made any mistakes or if additions are needed.

CryptoCurrency,"""People warned us about The Dip!"" and confirmation bias rant post I saw a couple of posts recently where people point out at other posts where people predict the dip months ago. And their conclusion is that r/cryptocurency is just an echo chamber where people upvote bull posts when in bull run to use as a confirmation bias. 

But I feel deep irony about people going to search for a bear posts because they are now biased that ""bull run is over"". And yes, they are using those post as a confirmation bias in this situation. 

I will carefully listen both to people who predict btc 10k or 300k, AS LONG AS they have at least remotely compelling arguments. Because ""oh we are going down because fear and greed is saying that people are greedy is not a legitimate argument"".

Because, in the end, hindsight is the greatest argument in any technical analysis.

CryptoCurrency,"I'm a newbie to crypto, my investment is dwindling by the minute but I feel utterly confident I don't have hundreds of thousands invested, just a modest amount that I can afford to never see again. But I have no fear I won't see it again, I will and it'll have grown considerably by the time I pull the investment out. How am I so sure?

Simply because crypto is very much still in its infancy. It might drop lots more, might not but as more and more technology gets behind it, businesses adopt it as an alternative way to pay and /or tip and the youth of today grow up and embrace it, it can really only go one way over the coming years.

This isn't financial advice,  I'm just an optimistic ape."
CryptoCurrency,"Is holding your coins on a centralized service REALLY unsafer than in your own wallet for the average user? This I have been thinking about a lot. Technically your own (cold) wallet is the safest option, however the stories of people getting scammed out of crypto by entering their seed phrase into some website has made me think if the average user wouldn’t just be best off to store their coins on Coinbase f.e. (Provided they have all the necessary security measures in place). Yes you hear stories about things like sim-swapping etc., but pretty much all of these cases can be traced back to some lack of security in the persons measures, not the exchange (of course same can be said about the wallet option, but that’s exactly my point then, if it’s all up to you personally, then it doesn’t matter much which way you store them).

Also, I see many people are now storing a big chunk of their holdings on centralized services like BlockFi or Celsius in order to earn interest. So far (correct me if I’m wrong) I have not heard of these services being hacked, I would assume they have the best possible security measures in the world in place, so for people trying to steal crypto, it’s probably more lucrative and much easier than hacking a service like that. 

So for the average user, maybe it’s not such a bad idea after all to trust some centralized exchanges or services with your money?"
CryptoCurrency,"The ₿ Word, could have any impact on the btc price? So, since all i see is related to bear or bull cycle...could we talk about something else?

 Elon Musk of Tesla, Jack Dorsey of Twitter and Cathie Wood of ARK Invest will discuss Bitcoin during ""The ₿ Word"" on Wednesday, July 21.

 According to the release, “The ₿ Word” will also feature presentations from Adam Jonas of Chaincode Labs, Steve Lee of Square Crypto, Hester Peirce of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Hong Fang of OKCoin, John Pfeffer of Pfeffer Capital, Lyn Alden of Lyn Alden Investment Strategy, Nic Carter of Castle Island Ventures, Neha Narula of the MIT Digital Currency Initiative, Peter McCormack of the “What Bitcoin Did” podcast and more. (bitcoin magazine)

How do you guys see this kind of event? 

Could something like this have a positive or negative impact in the btc price?

Could something like this have an impact on the bad narrative that the media provide of cryptospace?

Personally a global adoption and different narrative for btc in this case but for all the cryptospace could be pushed by these big personality and company owner. As long as i don't like the way Elon Musk irresponsably use social media, Tesla as a company have a big impact on the market and global world. We already see Jack talking about a possible implementation of the LN on twitter and they are currently develop a wallet related to btc. Cathie Wood is really bullish on btc and believe in this tecnology.

Plus this could be the end of energy fud spread by mr musk.

ps. all the markets are down, so don't panic if you can.

Stay safe."
CryptoCurrency,"Telling people now is a good buying opportunity doesnt do anything This is a great buying opportunity but everyone who knows that is buying already. Obviously theres a strong dose of hopium and confirmation bias in this post, just because I *think* its a good buy opportunity doesnt make that true.

Right now theres a lot of posts going round (this one included) saying buy, DCA, opportunities etc etc. The direction of the market (aka the dip) tells us thats all empty words. The majority is bearish and the price reflects that. 

At the end of the day we know people buy more when they see green and sell more when they see red. A strange phenomenon but very much observed. We can encourage DCAing as much as we please but realistically if people aren't already doing it, posts encouraging the strategy wont change that. Crypto is unpredictable and we're all riding the wave our own ways.

CryptoCurrency,"Grief, ostriches and crypto **What?**

When faced with a loss of any kind, but usually the ones that have the potential to seriously affect mental state, human brains delve in the 5 stages of grief: denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance. Basically trying to shelter yourself from loss by way of mental tricks.

&amp;#x200B;

**HODL** **In trading**

The [initial HODL post](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=375643.0) summed it up perfectly. All it takes is one mistake on when you sell to mess it up and lose even more money, while holding will make sure you lose nothing when it goes up again (which is what everyone hopes).

&amp;#x200B;

**How**

*Denial:*

I believe being afraid of messing up and losing the (of course it will!) bounce up is what makes people HODL, deep down. That's because they can't afford to lose even more money than they have already. 

*Bargaining*

They usually attribute themselves noble characteristics denoting strength, like ""diamond hands"", or a sense that they are helping others by doing so. Maybe helping a cause? This stage gets merged with other personal beliefs, like anti-government sentiment, destabilising the ""old system"" and so on. Bargaining!

*Anger:*

At the same time, ""traders and whales"" become natural enemies, the group that gets blamed, to try and deflect one's own responsibility. ""It's not my fault"" goes hand in hand with blind hope (denial stage).

*Depression and Acceptance:*

memes, selling, becoming a sworn enemy of 'magic internet money' maybe

&amp;#x200B;

**Why**

I'm partial to believe HODLing is just unmitigated, ignorance or lack of knowledge fuelled, pure fear. Fear of failing, fear of the unknown, doubt, anger at one's self, sprinkled with lashing out at others. 

Peer pressure also has to do with it, being ridiculed by strangers who were also afraid and then validate their choice when someone messes up. In the same way that a large enough group of people with the same feelings can persist in validating each other's choices, even though none of them have any clue about the future. Having order and a belief system, even if it's fundamentally flawed, is easier to cope with than accepting chaos and uncertainty. 

This also means that whoever breaks the norm from the continuous wishful thinking is encouraged to leave, since the group's system of coping is already fragile enough (FUD).

**Analogy**:

It is believed that when sensing danger, an ostrich might choose to bury its head in the sand, hoping the danger would go away. 

Some ostriches might flee and get eaten, because they've attracted the predator's attention. So that validates the hiding ostrich's choice. 

But if they'd all flee or if they'd all stay put, one of them would surely get eaten too. 

In the end, the result is the same, but the perception is not. 

Majority rules above reason."
CryptoCurrency,"Apply this Zen lesson to Crypto: “We’ll See” – A Cautionary Fable Toward the end of the movie “Charlie Wilson’s War,” there is told one of my favorite stories. A CIA officer, played by Philip Seymour Hoffman, cautions the Wilson character, played by Tom Hanks, not to be too sure they have done something glorious in helping to chase the Soviets out of Afghanistan. To make the point, he tells the fable of a Zen master and a boy. It goes something like this:

On his sixteenth birthday the boy gets a horse as a present. All of the people in the village say, “Oh, how wonderful!”

The Zen master says, “We’ll see.”

One day, the boy is riding and gets thrown off the horse and hurts his leg. He’s no longer able to walk, so all of the villagers say, “How terrible!”

The Zen master says, “We’ll see.”

Some time passes and the village goes to war. All of the other young men get sent off to fight, but this boy can’t fight because his leg is messed up. All of the villagers say, “How wonderful!”

The Zen master says, “We’ll see.”

The message behind this story is pretty clear. We’re prone to jump to conclusions about whether something is “good” or “bad.” We are especially quick to label something as “bad.” The reality is that things can be either good or bad, both good and bad, or neither."
CryptoCurrency,"IT'S A BEAR TRAP!!! Billionaires are on our side and will fight. So are the facts. I don't post often but you all need to see this, so you don't make a huge mistake and sell !! 

Consider:

• Tesla bought a $1.5B worth of BTC. Do you really think they sold all?! They sold 10% before the Q2 earnings call, to show profit. Q3 call is planned for 26 of July. Elon will do everything he can to pump it before the call. Elon Musk, Jack Dorsey &amp; Cathie Wood will talk in the B Word conference tomorrow. Do you think this is coincidence?! They are friends, big things will be announced and it will trigger continuation of the bull run!

• Ethereum London fork is coming and it will change it's tokenomics. EIP-1559 is the big one, but other 3 will also make ETH more scarce. When you think about it, so far it looks that switch to PoS will be a success. Over 6mln ETH is now staked. Now, that we have multiple L2s, the best way to support and secure Ethereum, is to raise it's price as much as possible. The Ethereum foundation will focus on this now. It's a smart move. After all, ADA has more $ staked, that's unacceptable!!

• Chainlink is everywhere. It secures $30B, yet token is market cap at below $6.7B. Sergei, one of the founders, has spoken for Business Economic Forum and Swift. Swift settles $1.25 quadrillion a year. Yeah, with a Q not B. Even if portion of this starts using Chainlink oracles and Ethereum, what's coming is easy to predict.

• IT'S NOT IF, BUT WHEN. Just hold and relax. HODLers win.



I'm very glad to be a part of this amazing community. Sure we have some disagreements, but that's healthy, it's called freedom of thought and speech. After all, the lion share of us are in the blockchain space for the better future.

Look, I get it, everyone wants to be bullish, and for sure, there were more people proclaiming a never-ending bullrun, than urging cautious pragmatism. That is the whole reason behind the [Fear and Greed Index](https://alternative.me/crypto/fear-and-greed-index/). You want to sell in times of greed. And to be honest, you want to buy in times of *boredom*, not fear. When everyone is panicking, that means we can go further down. When everyone has left and given up, that’s the time to start buying - in the long, boring, months where nothing seems to be happening.

When everyone is irrationally exuberant, you get drowned out for saying the opposite. That itself is a sign of confirmation bias, and one you should be looking out for.

I just did a quick search for dissenting voices from the last few months. There were many more, especially in the daily, but this at least proves that yes, some people thought we were nearing a top (if not *the* top), and yes, some people took profits before the crash.

# My point

It’s quite easy to be dismissive of TA because in the short term, it’s just noise and essentially useless. Additionally, I’d guess that many of the people on this sub have been here less than six months. That, by definition, is short term. So I understand the scepticism. However, over a longer period, THERE ARE patterns. Not exact “sell here, it’s going down tomorrow” patterns, but “it’s been going up for months, we’re really far from the moving average, every single indicator is saying we’re near a top, the fear and greed index is at maximum greed, there are memecoins everywhere, this really feels quite a lot like 2017, possibly it’s a good time to gradually take profits over the next several weeks” pattern. To dismiss TA is one thing, to deny the fact there is even such a thing as “overbought” or “oversold” is another. Everything follows cycles.

I’m not saying sell everything now, just be aware of a few indicators for next time. 

# Bonus Post

Back in December 2017, there were a lot of posts from longterm hodlers that they were cashing out. Just like now, they largely got ignored. In fact there were so many, that someone made this Grade-A shitpost, mocking them:

I clearly remember reading this and thinking it was hilarious. The market crashed and entered a three-year bear market two weeks later. OK, the sentiment was wrong, but he was right about one thing: **You can DCA out as well as in. You don’t have to sell everything. Better to sell a bit, than nothing at all.**"
CryptoCurrency,"For people new to crypto: this never happened before. This is the first dip in cryptocurrency history. So we all know Satoshi Nakamoto made Bitcoin so that the value will go up forever exponentially.

Right now Bitcoin dropped below $30k and I never seen this before (I am a crypto veteran since February 2021). Some YouTube crypto experts said Bitcoin was going to reach $200k by the end of this year. I am not sure what is happening now, but it clearly is market manipulation.

Even though we still have time to reach $200k end of the year, as a veteran, I think it is wise to sell now and FOMO back in when when you see the price go up.

Robinhood makes commision and needs them sold back and forth to make money. A recent interview Vlad the CEO explained this. Within each of the 7 coins they offer there is a ""News"" feed category. More often than not 3 of the coins have an empty ""News"" feed category but the 4 most popular coins have had a full (3 article) feed. The feed has always been a variety of strangely upbeat current news and only a few times something negative. Today I noticed they removed them all together. I think this is another unfortunate step RH has taken to show its interests do not align with the people who have trusted them to be stewards of their money."

CryptoCurrency,"I’m new.... New to crypto started in February. Bought near ATH, victim of 2 flash loan attacks , 2 rugs and some poo coins. Now that it seems a bear market could be around the corner. I’m feeling a bit defeated. I’m at a stage I don’t want to look cause every time I do it’s worst. What’s funny is I entered crypto not to become a millionaire but just to be able to buy a bigger home for the family. I haven’t put money we can’t live without, but I feel like to get out of the trap I’m in I’ll have to keep digging deeper into the pockets. Any advice for this beginner?"
CryptoCurrency,"People who bought at ATHs, the market is a cycle. Stay strong! First and foremost, how are you feeling? 

I see a lot of bear market screams and felt like sharing my experience. I have been lurking on this sub since the 2018 crash. A lot of people were claiming that it was the end of crypto and it's appeal had worn off. No one here can accurately predict what will happen in the coming weeks or months. People will scream bull and bear everyday. Don't forget that even a broken clock will tell time correctly twice a day. 

Investing in crypto is ultimately a tool to improve your quality of life. The people who bought at ATH in 2018 and held it for all these years are still in the green. If your investment goal in crypto is longterm, simply sit back and let the market go through it's cycle."

CryptoCurrency,"[BITCOIN] Massive crash: another 30-35% fall from current price happening soon Mine is just a theory taking in consideration various but simple parameters:

\- Previous bottoms/tops

\- Bitfinex BTCUSD LONGs/SHORTs

\- Correlation with SP500

I'm not a financial advisor, this is just my point of view and is not a sure forecast (since in the markets those do not exist)

Let's start:

We are in an obvious Bear Market, and still far from the bottom, not strictly because of the price, but because of the timing.

Many people talk about accumulation/consolidation period, however this is not the case, since there is no show of a resistance level, and actually there are only lower highs:

[https://www.tradingview.com/x/Dv6HdIRb/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/Dv6HdIRb/)

Price, even though still falling, has been holding better thanks to traders leveraging up Long position but now they look like out of steam:

[https://www.tradingview.com/x/4EQ9PZEm/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/4EQ9PZEm/)

SP500 could keep falling, this week, next week who knows when. Especially since price broke support level of a massive falling Wedge. Institutions are in the crypto market but they might close all their positions to avoid massive losses especially if the stock market is not looking so good:

[https://www.tradingview.com/x/FwfB93kj/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/FwfB93kj/)

Looking at the first link posted, a strong area of support could be between 2018 Top 19800USD and 22000USD (LOG 38.2% Fibonacci Level from previous bottoms DEC 2018 and MAR 2020)"

CryptoCurrency,"Quickest way to earn BAT on Brave Browser I don’t know if you guys knew this “feature”, but I think I found a way to maximize your BAT/hour income.

So you know you can set a maximum of 5 pop-up ads per hour, which gives you 0.010 BAT for every pop-up. This requires one of this two actions: browsing for an hour or leave the computer on for an hour. Sometimes we don’t have that hour to browse, and leaving the computer on it’s a cost of electricity, which is not worth it.

Well, I found out by browsing that if you open a new window on the browser, sometimes appears a background “ad” image, which gives you 0.010 BAT even if you open the window and close it immediately. If you repeat this action, you’ll see at least 5 images (maximum per hour) and you earn the same amount of BAT in 2 minutes rather than 1 hour (0.050 BAT)

Is this information useful or you guys already knew that and I’m an idiot? Let me know, in that case I’ll delete the post.

If you don't feel like you can keep your emotions out of your investment decisions, perhaps it's too early for you to take your financial situation into your own hands. the only thing coming out this situation is you needing a bank loan for fiat, and them enforcing even worse restrictions and getting even more profit.

Can you recommend any exchanges that allow sepa and as the cherry on top maybe don't need KYC?
I have found FTX to be an alternative as it provides sepa services, staking opportunities and low fees however it appears to me that it is more for traders (plus it needs KYC).

I'm interested in your suggestions."
CryptoCurrency,"New to Crypto? Phrases or Terms you may often see in Chatrooms 1. Hold On for Dear Life (HODL)
HODL, is currently used in chatrooms to signify the intent to hold onto crypto for dear life.  Meaning, do not sell your crypto at any cost.

2. Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt (FUD)
It's hardly surprising that what some dub the wild west of investing has its own acronym for the whirlwind of nervousness and apprehension that can come with it. The fact is, this is such a new industry that we can't be sure how it will pan out. This fuels constant rumors that the end is nigh -- or that Bitcoin (BTC) is about to rebound to its all-time highs.
You'll also see accusations that people are ""spreading FUD."" The connotation here is that they are deliberately sharing false or misleading information to influence a coin's price.

3. Fear Of Missing Out (FOMO)
That anxiety you feel when a coin on your watchlist suddenly jumps in price and you wonder if you should buy it so you don't miss out on any further gains? It has a name: FOMO. A lot of people who hadn't bought crypto had a severe case of FOMO back in March when prices seemed to go nowhere but up.
FOMO was officially added to the Oxford dictionary in 2013 and applies outside the crypto world, too.

4. Going to the moon
Crypto investors hope their coins might go to the moon. It's a stratospheric growth that sends the coin's price off the charts -- to the moon. Also known as mooning, you'll often find the term in memes and Reddit forums.

5. Diamond hands or paper hands
Serious HODLers have diamond hands -- referring to a diamond's ability to withstand enormous pressure. People with diamond hands do not sell, no matter what. In contrast, if someone has paper hands, they sell at the first sign of trouble.
On forums, having paper hands is usually used as an insult. But the truth is that sometimes it does make sense to sell a bad investment, even if you've lost money. It all depends on your investment strategy and personal situation.

6. Whales
Cryptocurrency whales own enough of the currency to have an outsized influence on the price. Back in 2017, about 1,000 people owned 40% of all the Bitcoin in circulation. Many of these Bitcoin whales bought into crypto early. Famous whales include the Winklevoss twins, Tim Draper, and Michael Saylor.

7. Do Your Own Research (DYOR)
Do Your Own Research.  It’s okay to watch Youtube, twitter, celebrities and chatrooms express their interest about certain crypto currencies, but in the end, you should “Do Your Own Research” before buying any crypto assets.

8. Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA)
If you bought $500 worth of MATOC (250 coins) at $2.00 and the price dropped to $1.00, you should purchase another $500 MATIC (500 coins) at $1.00.  This strategy will bring your overall cost of each coin $1.33.  So it is “Vital” that you DCA when the price of your original purchase dips considerably.  This is how you “average” out the cost of your original purchase.  

9. Know Your Customer (KYC)
Know Your Customer, refers to the verification process that customers go through in order to: Verify their identity and link it to a cryptocurrency wallet…and get a better understanding of the potential customer's activities in order to determine whether or not transactions are legal in nature.  KYC Verification has become less favorable over time.

10. Anti-money Laundering (AML)
While cryptocurrency means cheaper, faster international transactions, it also makes the crypto sector ripe for criminal activity, such as money laundering and terrorist funding. To stay ahead of this, regulatory bodies are installing anti-money laundering (AML) legislation.

11. (Copium)
Copium is a combination of Cope and Opium. It refers to the use of a fictional drug to help deal with the loss of your crypto currency.  

12. (Hopium)
HOPIUM is combination of Hope and Opium.  This refers to a fictional drug that gives you courage and confidence to dive into the market and hope for the best.

13. Bleeding Out (BO)
When your crypto is losing money and the charts are all red, this is referred to as bleeding out."

A friendly reminder that things might get worse but they also always get better. As many have witnessed yourself from Q4 2020, a week in crypto can wipe off years of losses (yes XRP ""army"" I talking to you) and make some decent profit too...

TL;DR: don't listen to anyone, don't look at the charts too much and tell everyone who brings bear/bull analysis to go and f\*\*k themselves!"
CryptoCurrency,"Unless you are a trader forget about bear or bull market. Think as an investor! I see so many post arguing whether we are in a bull or bear market. The truth is nobody knows. 

But at the end of the day, unless you are day trading, it shouldn’t really matter to you if you if you think as an investor.

Warren Buffet famously said: “The market is a machine for transferring wealth from the impatient to the patient”.

And this is happening now. Investors buy into assets / projects they really believe in and then just hold. Imagine buying Apple or Amazon 10 years ago? You enjoy growth and dividends for more than a decade. Some would argue the best time to sell and asset you believe in is never! Borrow against it if you need liquidity.

For cryptos it’s the same if you approach it as an investor. Only buy project you truly believe in. Do extensive due diligence before buying in and HODL for 10 years or more. Even consider forever (seriously).

Favor projects that allow staking and enjoy the payouts. (Beware or projects with huge staking rewards. If it’s too good to be true it probably is).

Of course a word of caution is necessary on the due diligence part: many crypto asset projects are scams or have very week value proposition. This is why careful due diligence is so important and should consist of more than watching a couple of videos on YouTube. If you consider investing for a long time favor projects that have already survived a market cycle.

Next, as an investor, you should only invest money you can afford to lose. This will give you peace of mind when the price goes down below your purchase price  (and it will) because you won’t be forced to sell at a lose. 

Consider DCA (dollar cost averaging) to increase your position, particularly when the price goes below your initial purchase price but again, only money you can afford to lose or won’t need in the short term.

Last but certainly not least: if you are not considering holding forever set your moon! In other words set a price at which your investment has reach a value that make your investment successful for you.

If you approach your crypto purchases as an investments all the rest becomes noise. Bear, bull market, TA signals, FUD… won’t matter.

The only thing you should do is follow the project you invested in and ask yourself this: are the news I’m reading from reliable source about my investment make me want to continue hodling forever or not?

Best of luck to all you crypto investors out there!"
CryptoCurrency,"Women in Cryptocurrency: A Global Study of Causes and Problems &amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/698ry78gncc71.png?width=1908&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=99fce35d2119f2baa70c390f15a0b7232233ef3e

This research aims to highlight the problems of women in the cryptosphere. The gender gap is very high here, and the latest market analytics show that women make up only 5% of the total number of crypto users globally.

The female audience has not been researched by companies that offer services and products in the crypto industry. Startups spend their efforts on attracting men only. The study aims to address this issue and explain how women in the crypto industry make decisions.

For this purpose, group interviews and questionnaires were conducted: more than 400 women from 28 regions participated.

# Key insights

Every third lady found herself in the cryptoindustry thanks to interaction with informants from her personal circle (spouse, colleague, or friend). Also, this decision is influenced by the abundance of news about the crypto industry and workplaces in this sector.

The main reason for mastering the cryptosphere is to improve one’s financial situation (this is relevant for more than half of the respondents). Moreover, ladies want to try something new (50%) and become financially independent (44%).

Women either invest in cryptocurrencies or store coins. Less than 20% are involved in trading.

One of the most attractive features of cryptocurrency is freedom. It means a great choice of coins for investment and limitless personal account management.

Projects are selected according to two criteria: capitalization and practical application of the project.

Pretty often, women in the crypto industry face FOMO. However, some inevident factors prevent them from entering the crypto market: joint bank accounts and online communities where men behave improperly.

More than 70% of respondents complained about the lack of training materials for beginners.

CryptoCurrency,Wealthy are accumulating crypto and the amateur investor is selling in fear Is what I read here multiple times in a somewhat similar fashion now we're entering a bear(ish) market and I would disagree with that. It's not about being wealthy or not wealthy (all depends on perspective if you consider yourself or anyone wealthy anyway). It has to do with believing in the tech and are willing to invest some of your money into this tech. One person has more money to invest than the other. But wealthy people aren't immune to fomo or fear to lose some of their invested money just like anyone else. It just comes down to how much you believe in the tech and trust that the marked will recover and come back to ATH+
CryptoCurrency,"That's why we need crypto: new EU law allows providers to scan every photo and video sent privately by people on email, fb, whatsapp etc. This new law called ePrivacy was voted few days ago.

Officially they did it in order to fight pedo pornography and criminal activities, but I don't think pedophiles send each other photos using Gmail.

However thanks to this law, all internet and service providers will be required to scan every photo and video sent by users, and contact authorities if anything illegal was sent.

The law even says that the apps that use cryptography should scan every media before it gets crypted.

I know it's not directly related to cryptocurrencies, but for me it's crazy how countries are using technology to violate the privacy of people, **we are to focused on the price of btc and other crypto, but we should remember that the point of crypto is not to exchange it to fiat and make money, but to be free from centralized and controlled institutions**

Has anyone tried it for ETH staking? Or have you got any other platform to recommend?  
Also, I have noticed that on crypto.com the staking locking period is of 3 months, but the rewards of 6.5% are computed over one year. I think it is impossible that this means that you can stake your ETH four times a year earning 6.5% each time, so could you explain how this works exactly?

CryptoCurrency,"The Fallacy Of Onchain Metrics: Take A Simple Statistic - Are Miners Selling? Based On Your Data Source, You Will Get 2 Contradicting Opinions. Onchain stats especially about Bitcoin has been the source of a lot of controversy of late. Some of the popular onchain ""experts"" have used this to proclaim we are in a correction, while more pragmatic analysts have long concluded that this is not a small correction. 

Let us consider one of the key questions currently that onchain analysts are trying to answer to decide if the current range is the bottom or of it is just a number on the way to the bottom. 

It is known that when miners accumulate, they believe the price will go up, and when miners sell in numbers, they believe the market is weak. Lets look at this metric from 2 different data providers Glassnode and Cryptoquant - and how both are contradictory to one another.

[Gassnode data shows miners are accumulating](https://preview.redd.it/vcj1znwgjcc71.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fa649d51b6a388cc062243c0de945fcd55808b5a)

CryptoQuant shows that over the last few days, miners have sent over 35k to exchanges. 

So.. who should you believe?"
CryptoCurrency,"I’m new to this, but if you’re panicking now, crypto is not for you First time buyer here, came into crypto a few weeks ago, catching slightly better prices than the ATH and DCA-ing the last few weeks. I’m a little surprised to read people calling this a major crash and stressing big time over this week’s swing. Don’t get me wrong it’s not pleasant to see a portfolio in the red. But let’s be clear here: the cryptos I am holding are barely hitting some of the “dip” value they had a month ago. Some are about what they were worth 3 months ago on average. And even if they dropped to mid last year value, some would be losing “only” 70% of value from their ATH.

Folks, you’re not buying the S&amp;P500 here. And even those who do play in the stock market have experienced last year what it’s like to see a market melt (and rebound). Right now what we’re seeing is at most cute compared to some of the pains and joys we’re going to experience in the next few years here.

The bottom line for me is simple: this is crypto. It’s a rollercoaster ride. You don’t start sweating when you’re 30% or even 50% down- that’s table stakes for something like this. You can’t just invest in something that can shoot up 300% in a matter of weeks and not be able to stomach 40% declines. 

Honestly where we’re at right now is just regular DCA, we’re not even at an “aggressively buy the dip” event for many of the coins, there’s still plenty of margin for it to go down. 

If you’re losing sleep over what’s happening, it probably means 3 things:

1/ you came in hot and put all your money at once around an ATH and you need to learn how to DCA when entering volatile positions. One simply does not get to Mordor with a lump sum when the market is at ATH. Take a breath and get yourself ready for another investment later (if you plan to stay in crypto). It sucks, but hopefully you’ll have learned a valuable lesson. 

2/ you’re not diversified and put all your money and hopes on crypto, which means you’re not ready to lose it all and see the swings. At the end of the day it’s your decision and your money, but there is a reason why highly volatile positions are never advised for your total retirement plan. At most, buy crypto the way you buy a TV screen, settle for what seems comfortable and buy a little over that. But don’t go buy the IMAX screen for your 400sq ft studio apartment. Stay within your means and be happy you could get in.

3/ you’re not ready for investments like crypto. You’re new to investing and don’t know what it’s like to lose money (even if you don’t sell it). Either you are investing because you believe in the long term and know that sweat will be about those years, or you’re investing in the short term and should entirely play this the same way would the casino: knowing it’s not just about winning the jackpot, it should first and foremost be about having fun. If you’re sweating and panicking at the roulette table, you’re at the wrong table. And yes you may have a gambling addiction.

I have no fucking clue if we’re going to go much lower or much higher. I just know that there is an extremely high likelihood that whatever we’re experiencing this week will just look like a barely perceptible blip in a few years (probably even in a few months). And blips are not worth losing sleep (or worse) over. Take care and remember: don’t be too hard on yourself, you just got a story to tell your grandkids."

CryptoCurrency,"A positive experience with customer support(Coinex). A couple weeks ago i had to change my phone number, i went through everything multiple times to make sure i wouldn't loose any accounts that could be bound to my number, but Murphy's law is king and i forgot about Coinex... Fast forward to a couple day ago and one of my shitcoin moonshots paid off with a huge pump, but since is was a low cap shitcoin, only coinex had it listed.

I deposited without issue, traded for USD's and proceded towards the checkout like i had done many times before. When coinex asked me for a SMS confirmation i realised i was screwed, I ran to get my old SIM card(i had left a couple months of service paid for in case i had to come back to it in an emergency), slotted it in my phone and proceded with the confirmation, but i received no code, nothing. I hit the ""send"" button again, nothing, test SMS reception with my new number and everything works, but still no code

Immediately came to mind all the horror stories i had been reading here, funds locked, unresponsive support, months of waiting for a solution or getting none at all, having to verify my identity through paperwork...  let's just say i was sweating some serious mom's spaghetti, my stomach was churning at the thought of what was to come.

At this point i had no choice but to submit a support ticket, as i read the warning that it would take them 24h to get back to me i thought ""here we go"", not expecting a reply for at least a week.

Much to my surprise, i had a reply in under 2 hours which basically said ""Can't do SMS? that's cool, here is what you need to setup an alternative 2FA, your withdrawals will be frozen for 24h after the change but beyond that you are good to go""

I immediately setup a login through the provided instructions and after the 24h was up, i withdrew my funds without fuss.

This port is merely a counter-point to the horror stories posted almost daily, it does not invalidade any of my brothers's  complaints or issues. I gave customer support a chance and they came through so they deserve their kudos."

Were the same posts made on 22nd of July when the price dipped below 29.000$ to 28.805$ for a short period of time?  
I mean it hasn't recovered much since then - people can argue that we have been in a bear market since May or even earlier. Which might even be true.   
But what are the signs that we won't at least recover above 30.000$ again? See BTC in the 40.000$ again or even explode another time for a bullrun when ETH 2.0 comes around?

The fall in BTC came among a wider decline seen in cryptocurrencies whose collective market capitalization fell 7.04% to $1.2 trillion this evening.

On Monday, BlockFi received an order from the New Jersey Bureau of Securities to suspend applications for new interest accounts in the state, as per a tweet from BlockFi CEO Zac Prince, first seen on The Block.

Why It Matters: Prince said that BlockFi is engaging with the regulators to help them understand the company’s products.  “BIA [BlockFi Interest Account] is not a security, and we therefore disagree with the action by the New Jersey Bureau of Securities,” said the executive.

Last month, regulators in Canada’s British Columbia had published a statement of allegations against Binance, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world.  The Changpeng Zhao-led exchange was ordered by United Kingdom regulators to stop activities in the country."

CryptoCurrency,"Is holding your coins on a centralized exchange REALLY unsafer than in your own wallet for the average user? Is holding your coins on a centralized service REALLY unsafer than in your own wallet for the average user?

This I have been thinking about a lot. Technically your own (cold) wallet is the safest option, however the stories of people getting scammed out of crypto by entering their seed phrase into some website has made me think if the average user wouldn’t just be best off to store their coins on Coinbase f.e. (Provided they have all the necessary security measures in place). Yes you hear stories about things like sim-swapping etc., but pretty much all of these cases can be traced back to some lack of security in the persons measures, not the exchange (of course same can be said about the wallet option, but that’s exactly my point then, if it’s all up to you personally, then it doesn’t matter much which way you store them).

Also, I see many people are now storing a big chunk of their holdings on centralized services like BlockFi or Celsius in order to earn interest. So far (correct me if I’m wrong) I have not heard of these services being hacked, I would assume they have the best possible security measures in the world in place, so for people trying to steal crypto, it’s probably more lucrative and much easier than hacking a service like that. 

So for the average user, maybe it’s not such a bad idea after all to trust some centralized exchanges or services with your money?"

CryptoCurrency,"This on-going market crash is a true life changing gift for those new to crypto Yes, I know I sound crazy, but please put down your pitckforks (aka downvotes) and hear me out. 

Make no mistake, we are in an on-going crypto winter. Bitcoin and ETH can easily fall another 50% from here. I've been trading in the markets for over 10 years now and I know how bad it feels emotionally and psychologically to watch your positions fall by 50%, 60%, 70%, 80% etc. 

But there is a huge silver lining here for those of you who can be patient. You are being given the chance to buy before the next bull run/btc halvening cycle, at soon to be rock bottom prices. Imagine you got in ADA in 2019 at 2 cents, and watched your portfolio rise over 100x to $2.40. This is the life-changing opportunity you will be given over the coming months as the bear market continues and culminates. 

You have two choices: as the market continues crashing you can either sell everything in a fit of panic and fear, maybe post up a suicide post or two here, curse crypto as a scam that you will never touch again...

OR

You can accept the fact you were late to this bull cycle, but also recognize the opportunity you are being given to get in early for the next bull cycle in a year or three, and make potentially life-changing gains. If you FOMOd into this past bull market, chances are you didn't put that much money in anyway, compared to what you will be able to put in during this on-going crypto winter. And even if you did YOLO everything, you will be able to accumulate more money in the months and maybe even year over which the crypto bear market is on-going, to put in your favourite coins.

THAT is how most people made their fortunes in crypto. They held on and continued to buying at maasively discounted prices during the 2018 -2020 bear market, and then watched their holdings increase by 20x, 30x, 100x, 1000x etc during this recent bull market.

CryptoCurrency,"We are in a squirrel market and here is the proof  

First of all, if you can’t pronounce squirrel don’t worry, it means you are not a native English speaker and it’s normal.

What I’m about to tell you is well known by all the whales, banks and the IRS, definitely the IRS. The small shrimps were never supposed to have this information so get ready to be blown away.

As a professional cryptocurrency analyst (part-time ex-google, ex-facebook employee) I have dived into all the information available. (YouTube and twitter) I have also done extensive research on the colors green and red but mostly on candles.

Did you know that the most expensive wax for candles is beeswax? It costs 10 times more than cheap ass paraffin wax!! That’s like a 1000% increase in price in crypto! That’s nuts! 

\#whyredcandles? was one of the highest trending hashtags on twitter the past months so I started my research there. I found that many people were calling the current market a “bear market”. I wanted to know more but I had a lot of trouble finding bears in my country and also, I am scared of bears.

So I decided to study squirrels instead. Pretty scary too because those little fuckers are fast as hell, but I managed somehow.

Now what I found was that during the day, the squirrels went up the tree (green candle), stayed up there for a while wreaking havoc and then went back down (red candle). The timings could differ several hours (that’s months in squirrelyears) for each attempt.

Some squirrels would collect the nuts (coins) from the ground and put them up into their hole in the tree (wallet). The squirrels were really excited by this because of the high return in value. I noticed that sometimes they were collecting nuts (coins) from a branch and then proceeded to go down into their hole. This made them depressed as there was a significant decrease in value.

Other squirrels would just fly around from tree to tree fucking shit up. The real OG’s would gnaw on the electrical insulation of your power cables which would cause a fire that burnt your house down. They’d get electrocuted in the process but they don’t give two fucks.

Conclusion: squirrels are fast, fierce and unpredictable fuckers, who knows what they will do next. I’m scared..."

CryptoCurrency,"Grayscale Dump Seems to be Happening The Grayscale event looks one of the most apparent (and hopefully final) major crypto dumps on the market. It basically means a lot of BTC (40k or so) is now (or was) available on the market.

I watched [this video by Benson Crypto](https://youtu.be/Pfa8GNyM5Hs) during/after the fact, but it was illuminating on why Grayscale may be playing a role in the current crypto dip. [Another video from Coin Bureau](https://youtu.be/EFMn1_4nxhQ) supporting the Grayscale concern. Coin Bureau has also pointed out how Binance transactions are currently limited in Europe.

As a non-whale, and as so many others have pointed out, dollar cost average (DCA) in valid crypto projects. From my, the Grayscale event will cause an exchange of paper hands to diamond hands.💎👏

From my perspective, while Binance is currently limiting transactions in Europe, Binance in all likelihood will resolve this issue by implementing KYC, and working with EU regulators more closely, so this issue seems temporary at worst.

If you get into new projects, be wary of rug pulls and scam coins. Even if an influencer who you trust promotes an altcoin, go check the coin’s white paper along with several independent influencers.

CryptoCurrency,"If you're stressing right now you are looking at too short a time frame Hey guys I hope you're all keeping safe and well and drinking plenty of water.

The crypto market looks pretty back right now I think we are all in agreement. If you are sitting there staring at 1m 5m 15m candles its not really good for your health, (unless you are daytrading and scalping but I don't thats very good for you either)

Zoom out a bit to the daily and weekly charts, you get alot more data in each of the bars and its better to understand where we are at.

Daily bars are bearish but this is the third time we are bouncing off the 35 on the RSI indicator in the last 2 months, another rejection would be a good indicator for a turnaround. Also if you look at the daily we have yet to have a shoulder from the initial drop which I would want to see, as well as getting rejected to be fully bearish.

On the weekly we have just dipped under the 50 day moving average, if we can turn that candle into a wick by the end of the week it would be a bullish indicator for me, that would be recovering to about $32,000 for that to happen. Also the RSI of the weekly is sitting on 40, if there is a bounce from there that bullish imo.

On the monthly the RSI is currently where it was at when it was at 10k, 5 months later it was at 60k, just saying.

These sort of market movements have an element of physics to them the higher they rise the lower they fall, and vice versa, and if there is going to be a bullish recovery this is winding up for a HUUGE swing.

Of course I may be completely wrong, it could dump to $1, this it not financial advice, don't invest more than you can afford to lose and remember to spread love wherever you go.

Peace"
CryptoCurrency,"An analysis of DCA on different days of the week Ever wondered if buying on certain days of the week will give better returns than other days?

Same! So I checked - modeling the returns of someone much wiser than I, if they'd bought 100USD worth of ETH every week over the last few years. Here's what I found:

https://preview.redd.it/mq689215bcc71.png?width=1052&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f06802a68b8a12c826d128100043e466249ace91

Over the last 5 years, purchasing every Friday is the clear winner, while purchasing every Wednesday will have provided the worst returns.

Similarly, over the last 3 years, Friday buys will have put you ahead. 

But what if you started a year ago? Well Friday buys would've performed averagely, while Wednesday buys will have returned the best, despite being the worst day overall over the last 5 years.

And if you started buying at the peak, on April 14th, 2021? The trend almost reverses, with the best buys being over the weekend, and Wednesday -&gt; Friday giving the worst returns.

**What's the conclusion?** There's not much to read into here. You can try follow past trends, but over time the returns from the worst days are all within a few percentages of best days. 

The real takeaway here is that DCA is *fucking awesome.* You could have started buying into ETH at the ATH, and today still only be down 30-23%, despite ETH being down 60%.

**TL;DR:** Just throw a dart at your calendar and stick to it"

I was hooked in the first 5 minuted.

It was then when i started to do like a shit ton of research, really the down the rabbithole vibes. Since i just left a company i was building in the last 3 years, and kinda got ripped of by the owner. Since i build it, and when the moment of birth finally was there. He was like, yeah but i can't pay you bla bla bla. So i said to him, suck mah balls and left.
Have a new job now tho, and an amazing fkn title to it; Happiness Manager✌😂

But anyway, i see a lot of people stressing. I get it you bought on top. I did too, since it was my first run upwards ever. I just kept buying. And then BAMMMMM Red everywhere. And i get it, it is stressing to see your funds decrease this much. 

But you know what is less stressfull, just keep buying. It is a fucking huge Window of Opportunities at the moment if you ask me! Just buy, and bring down your average purchase prices. And then when you get that wonderfull time shit keeps booming upwards you can take your profits. Or hold.

I plan to do both, and i already shaved like 40%  on average of some of the peak prices i bought.
Things like this reduce the burn of having bought peaks.

So relax and enjoy the ride mah dudes!"

With Bitcoin losing an important support, there's a growing fear, how much further it will drop.

CryptoCurrency,"Binance suspended Harmony ONE withdrawal Hi guys,

Few days ago I started to withdraw from Binance the cryptos I own to stake them in their native wallets if it is possible (ADA, ALGO, VET, etc...).

My idea was to only keep on Binance the BETH (ETH staked) and the cryptos I want to sell when they go up again (CHZ and BAKE for example).

When I wanted to withdraw my Harmony ONE, Binance told me NO ! Withdrawal suspended. Without any explanation of why and when I will be able to do it. It is frustrating because I can't do anything, just wait and hope it will be ok one day.

This convince me more to not let any cryptos in exchanges, so guy when you can, withdraw immediately after you buy if you want to hold ! Having cryptos on their native wallets is always better and secure!

If they want Binance can suspend all cryptos withdrawal without explanations. 

In the future, I will start using other exchanges and never let cryptos in their hands !"

CryptoCurrency,"Can anyone explain the mechanism that makes every chart (or almost every chart) replicate the exact same movements as the BTC chart? So, looking at the charts in crabbish times, bullish times, and bearish times, I have noticed that the vast majority of altcoins follow the exact same swings as the BTC: they pump when it pums, they crash when it crashes, they dip when it dips, they stabilize when it stabilizes.

Sure, there are exceptions (AMP was pumping extremely well while all the crypto market was crabbing or even dipping, I don't recall), but that’s precisely what they are, exceptions.

What makes me wonder is not the fact that they follow Bitcoin qualitatively, it is normal for the whole crypto world to still be linked to Bitcoin's fate, what shocks me is that they replicate BTC movements *instantaneously* – how is it possible? What happens in those moments exactly on the exchanges? Why should a person who holds DOT decide to sell at almost the exact same moment BTC sees a 0.2% dip?  
 Do you have any idea of the mechanics behind this?

CryptoCurrency,"The good old days: I’m Kevin and I'm the guy who bought 259684 BTC for $2613 yesterday  

"" I was watching, like many of you, a gigantic sell order burning through the bids. Mt Gox doesn't execute trades very quickly, so we were watching this huge order slowly eat up every buy order on the books. The price started at around $17.50, and within minutes was below $10. At this point, I realized this wasn't merely a large seller willing to accept some losses. This was someone attempting to crash the market by selling a huge percentage of the market's total bitcoins at once.

I had around $3000 USD in my Mt Gox account, from earlier sales I'd made. I looked at the market stats, and realized that there were tons of orders to buy BTC at $0.01 that would likely eat up any remaining bitcoins this seller had on the order. I figured if I put a buy order in for $0.0101, my order would execute first and I could buy a huge amount of bitcoins from this seller before it hit the bottom. The only problem was that Mt Gox was running slower than molasses at the time, and everyone was saying that it wasn't accepting trades. I had to try several times, but eventually I got a buy order in, offering to buy as many bitcoins as I could for $0.0101.

The site stopped responding completely for a while, probably from so many people hitting refresh to see what was going on. When I got back in, I saw in my account:

06/19/11 17:51  Bought BTC  259684.77 for 0.0101

I had just purchased over 250,000 bitcoins for $2613. At the trading price immediately before this large sell order happened, that number would have been worth nearly $5 million. After I regained my breath, I tried to figure out what to do. I wasn't sure what was really going on. Over the past few days there had been a lot of talk and complaints about Mt Gox's security. Lists of Mt Gox usernames, email addresses and encrypted passwords were being traded around, which was an obvious sign that security at Mt Gox had been breached in some way. If there was an attacker in the system, perhaps he was able to log into my account now and force my account to execute some other crazy trade. ""

CryptoCurrency,"Does my UK limited business need to register with FCA to offer crypto as payment and P2P trade? I've been searching for days but can't come up with a definitive answer.

My company roasts coffee, we offered bitcoin as payment in 2018 or so, got about 2 orders for novelty and then nothing for years even though it remained as a payment option.

Recently (May 2021) we added Doge and got a few orders.

This interested me more into crypto and I've been researching and playing with trading. I made some money and loss some money - regular stuff.

But I have made money P2P trading USDT for fiat in binance. Obviously a way of making more money in times where our business has been hit hard by covid is appealing. Right now profit is about £200 by playing around but I've stopped trading until I work out if I need FCA registration.

Making the business about £1k-2k a month seems possible with a small outlay. This would make up for loss custom which is all I want.

However, previously looking at this I decided FCA registration wasn't required because of how tiny the amount is compared to regular coffee transactions. On the P2P trading it gets murkier because although I don't plan to make millions the edge I found is 2-3% profit. They are simple quick transactions that make profit. However, let's say I average 2.5% that means for every £25 I make there is £1000 entering the business. And then leaving again to cycle the profit.

Our business is small - £150k turnover. Husband (me) &amp; wife team. To make £2k there could be £80k extra leaving and entering the bank account. That change would alert even the softest of money laundering sensors which is why I thought maybe I should tell the FCA

Registration cost £2k. This would eat up any precious money I have to play with to make money. But the entrepreneur in me is thinking ""if I do register, maybe I can be on the ground floor of something that registered businesses can take advantage of"". But stuff like binance changing or laws changing could mean registration is an expensive admin procedure.

This is the FCA page I'm looking at https://www.fca.org.uk/cryptoassets-aml-ctf-regime/register

Or should I stick to coffee?"

CryptoCurrency,"How to beat the majority of investors There are a few easy rules to remember, if you want to make money investing in crypto. 

They sound easy, but aren't as easy to conduct because you have to act against the most basic mechanisms of fear and greed.

1. After pump comes dump: don't jump on the train when it is fast and pumping. It's totally okay to leave out this opportunity. Don't become the victim of your greed. The market is a zero sum game. Somebody has to buy the top. And greedy people tend to be the ones. 

Instead wait a few weeks to maybe months, until the price declined at least 50% (trust me, it will). The ones in profit are selling and the ones the majority of people who bought high are scared of even more losses and sell too. 

2. Embrace the fear: overcome your weak mind and buy at low prices. Your gut will tell you it's a bad idea, because 'if it's so low it has to fail'. The truth is, a solid project will pump again. Bitcoin and crypto is deeply rooted by now, and it will always come back. It's basically too big to fail. However this rule is not applicable to shitcoins, it has to be a reasonable project.

That's all. It's all about knowing the pump and dump cycles of the market and overcoming the fear and greed. If you follow these you will act smarter than the majority of retail investors."

The cryptocurrency market, like any other, is cyclical. This means that the market is not in a permanent state of growth or decline. These two states are cyclical. There is a rise cycle and there is a fall cycle. The scale and duration of the cycle may differ from case to case. There are deep and prolonged crises, and there are periods of rapid and rapid growth. An upturn cycle is commonly referred to as a bull market, and a downside cycle is called a bear market.

&amp;#x200B;

We are now in the midst of a bull market. It began in May 2020, when the third Bitcoin halving took place. How long the growth will last - no one knows. There are forecasts that Bitcoin will peak this summer, there are forecasts that this will happen in the fall, and some believe that growth will continue until the end of the year. Regardless of when we see the peak, it is important to understand that growth will not be endless. Sooner or later, the market will go into a downward phase. How strong this fall will be is very difficult to predict. But Bitcoin's average drawdown reaches -80% during a bear market.

&amp;#x200B;

You may have a logical question - why invest in Bitcoin now, if it will then be sold at an 80% discount? 🧐 Firstly, no one knows how much Bitcoin will fall, and secondly, if you are a long-term investor, then you should not be embarrassed when you buy an asset. Just think, even those people who bought Bitcoin at its peak in 2017 and held it to the current bull market made x3 of the initial investment. History shows that even after the worst fall, Bitcoin returns and breaks new records. 🚀

&amp;#x200B;

Why is Bitcoin growing slowly now, while Ethereum and other altcoins are growing rapidly? In the cryptocurrency market, in addition to cycles, there is the concept of seasons. The two main ones are the Bitcoin season and the altcoin season. During the Bitcoin season, however difficult it will be, Bitcoin is growing rapidly, while altcoins are growing relatively slowly. But at some point, Bitcoin reaches the ceiling and people realize that there is no way to earn much on Bitcoin. Therefore, there is a massive outflow of capital from Bitcoin, in search of quick and large profits. This is called the altcoin season. At the moment we are in the altseason, because as you can see, Bitcoin has not been making sudden movements for a couple of months, while Ethereum and other altcoins update their historical highs every day.

&amp;#x200B;

To understand global market behavior, you don't need to be a brilliant mathematician-economist with an IQ above 200. All market cycles and patterns are human behavior. If you are able to predict the demand of the general mass of people and understand their psychology, then you can always accurately determine which cycle and phase of the market you are in. Due to this, you will be able to make more balanced and accurate investment decisions. Therefore, as always, I urge you to improve your competence and the level of your knowledge. This is the best investment you can make right now :)"
CryptoCurrency,"Question about fees when moving crypto off exchanges I’m thinking of getting myself a cold storage device so that I can keep my crypto there. My gameplan is basically to DCA on a monthly basis into BTC and ETH. I’m curious what the best way to move it off the exchanges onto my cold storage device is, to avoid getting rinsed by fees? Am I just meant to bite the bullet every month and accept if I want to move it off an exchange there can be significant fees? Or maybe the fees aren’t even that bad. What are some basic tips you can lend me considering my gameplan? Is it better fees wise if I stack it for 2/3 months and transfer it all at once instead of in smaller monthly chunks, for example? I have no real clue.

Would be cool if anyone who also DCA’s with the intention of HODLing medium/long term and transfers across to cold storage could weigh in."
CryptoCurrency,"Don't worry it's national moon day. 🌛 A newbie entering at ATH, trying to catch a dead cat bounce a feeling a little down with the dips. Reading charts and Reddit rabbit holes on the state of play. Researching into other people's research then out of nowhere I get a notification from Wirex ""It's national moon day"" I couldn't help but laugh at the irony. Just sharing that I'm not alone in not knowing s*** about f***. 

P.S Thanks Wirex marketing team for the laugh and a touch of hopium. I'll be here HODLing and keeping the finger off the buy button for the time being. ✌️"
CryptoCurrency,"I called the price fall. Here's what I am doing now. Maybe some of you have seen [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/n83f7i/yall_have_gone_mad/) that I posted on may 9th, when BTC was at $58k. Hindsight is 20/20, so I think it's a good idea to post when I think sentiment is changing - just so there is a bit of record.  


On the day of my first post, I sold most of the crypto I had and shorted BTC. That, as it turns out, was a good idea. I closed my shorts at the way to $36k and stopped trading for a while since I thought the market could go either way. Now, I've bought back into BTC at $30k. Why? Because I think we're in to see a bull trap.

If you look at the charts, it becomes obvious that the current cycle is a bit stretched out compared to the previous cycles. This is likely because more people are in the space, so any movements happen at a slower rate. Currently, a lot of people are changing their minds towards ""the bear market is coming"". Which I agree with, but I believe that the real bear market will only set in in \~6 months. Once prices rise a bit again, people will go out and buy ""before we miss the bull run"". Especially the people that bought in on the top will fail to use this opportunity to cut their losses, as they will only want to sell once the price is higher than their entry price. These people will regret their greed once the market is in the next downturn again, and they will sell, contributing to the bear market.

In my personal opinion, the current situation is a gamble that is worth taking. There is a risk that we see a continued decline, in which case I'd sell at \~$27k, cutting losses (-10%). But I see a fair chance that we see \~$45k briefly (+50%). I'd place the odds of experiencing a bull trap before hitting $27k at \~50%, so for me, this is a gamble worth taking.

As always, set stop losses, take profits and don't let greed blind you."
CryptoCurrency,"The Whales are making huge profits by farming retail investors. Institutional investors are playing a significant role in the markets but we should not underestimate the huge numbers of retail investors, playing an massively important role in the centralization and accumulation of wealth. 

Small investors want to hang on till a crypto 20 x or 100x. Whales are happy to take 2x or 5x and dump. The small-time retail investor gets cold-feet, panic sells, and then the whales buy more and the hunt starts again. 

As for pumping and dumping, in an alternate universe where we eliminate careless speculation that doesn't respect the project, though we would also eliminate half of the investor interest. It’s the wild west out there at the moment. Particularly with these low cap coins, you can get on a rocket. But it's a bumpy rocket that goes down because whales can come in too, buy a large bag, and then dump and rebuy endlessly. 

(Some projects aren't going to make it and that's okay, and in the long run we will probably end up going from 10,000 shitcoins to having about 10 altcoins.)

Sometimes revolutions are surrendered peacefully to the tinkling sound of commerce, so when the markets are up, everyone's dancing and it doesn't seem so bad. When the markets crash, people become bitter and short-tempered. 

There are some people participating in crypto who don't see it as a way to ""decentralise"" and are more interested in the centralization of their personal wealth. 

This is a huge mistake and mostly plays directly into the institutional investors hands[.](https://cdn.ecohustler.com/media/2019/03/19/whale-shark-krill.png)"
CryptoCurrency,"Does Starling restrict payments to Crypto exchanges? I'm looking for a new bank. I'm currently with Monzo, but it's not meeting my needs so I've been looking at Starling. Everything looks good except for the fact that I have found a few posts on Reddit talking about Starling restricting payments to crypto exchanges (Coinbase, Binance, etc). I can't have a bank that does this.

Does Starling genuinely do this to everyone? Or is this more of an uncommon every once in a while occurrence?"

CryptoCurrency,"Language is important; don’t jump to conclusions To all fellow non-native speakers of English, don’t be fooled by persuasive, misguiding language in articles on crypto currencies. Remember:

*Could* is used to say that an action or event is possible.

*Might* refers to a situation or an event that has a possibility of occurrence.

*Would* is used to talk about a possible or imagined situation.

*Should* is used to say that something is the proper or best thing to do."
CryptoCurrency,"Anyone else than me hoping for Bitcoin to fall to 20k? I'm seriously bullish on crypto but I'd love to have the option to buy more around that price range. I don't mind if it'll take a year or longer before we hit the next bull run, right now I'm just waiting for it to fall further. 

Anyone else happy about the bear market?"
CryptoCurrency,"Everytime the market dips Bitcoin becomes a larger part of my portfolio without actually buying more I personally would not have the guts to enter in a bear market with anything less than 40-50% of Bitcoin in my portfolio.

Many of my altcoins have dropped by more than 75% from their ATH. If history is any indication, if this bear market continues until 2024 most of them will drop by even 99%.

I'm 80% in Bitcoin and Ethereum and I just sleep so much better after selling some other coins for them.

Does anyone have another strategy that works just as well?"
CryptoCurrency,"How to find low-cap gems What to look for when searching for low-cap gems:

Hi all, just felt like sharing something that I use when I look for new coins to invest for. Bare in mind these should not form part of the majority of your portfolio, these should be rather small capital ventures and if they pay off, they will make up for the ones you were wrong on.

I use coinpaprika.com for all my coin exploration.

1. Total supply:

Always look at how many coins are in existence. Read whitepapers on token economics. How many coins are up for public sale? How many are kept for developers? 
Personally - I do not like it if a coin surpasses the 50 billion total supply mark (just a personal conviction, no real science behind it, more detail in point 4).


2. The volume vs marketcap method:

I always look for coins who rank higher in volume than they do in market cap. Why? Liquidity. For example, a coin can be ranked 450 by marketcap but ranked 300 by 24hour volume. These types of coins are quite attractive as it shows liquidity for a relatively undiscovered coin.


3. Social media presence / Visibility of development team:

Check out their webpage if they have one. Is the development team visible? Sure there are exceptions to this, most obviously being Bitcoin. But for the purpose of low-cap coins it is critical that there is visibility of the development team. This shows both commitment to the project as well as PR.
Think of Projects such as ETH, ZIL and ADA. Thes projects all have a community figure that can rally a community. 


4. The $1 test:

If you feel like you found a coin that you want to invest in, do the $1 test.
If your coin was worth $1, where would it rank by marketcap? Top 100? Top 50? Top 10? Surpass BTC?
If your answer is the latter, then don't expect your coin to hit $1 anytime soon. If a coin can surpass all other coins being so cheap it probably means the total supply is too great.


5. Use-case and target market:

Which market is your coin trying to enter? NFTs? DeFi? Smart Contracts? Cross Border Payments? 
How many other coins are also fighting for a piece of this market? 

Eg. Smart Contract projects are all fighting for a share of the Eth market.

6. DeFi capability:

DeFi will always be attractive for people. If you can stake a coin at a reasonable APR, (not like Iron Finance 700% APR lol), then other people are bound to be attracted to the income produced from staking, if the above mentioned pointers are in place.


What do you use to find new coins? USing the things I mentioned above I have found 3 projects that I really like (Healthcare, Streaming and Payments projects).Hopefully in 5 years time I will not regret putting a little money in each of them. 

Rember, being right with an investment is far easier than being early &amp; right. This guide will hopefully allow us to be both."
CryptoCurrency,"To all the long term investors, big and small, if you’ve invested your money on the coins that you think will or presently have significant technological and innovative uses like ETH. No doubt your investnent will turn into profit. So keep HODLing. You won’t regret it. Keep in mind though, %90 percent of all coins that promise you something will perish over time. Try and find the ones that already have the lead start. They are not going away. The game started a long time ago. They’ve seen much worse bear markets than the current one. Think about it like any economical sector. Because there’s money to be earned still, there are too many suppliers. But once the actual use of these coins starts taking off, there won’t be this much coins on the market. It will be like any other market. To give an example take any majorly used market from sports shoes to tech companies. There’s only a handful of them that are actually big that comes to mind at first thought. The rest are gone."
CryptoCurrency,"What if Cryptocurrency is a Giant Shill? Okay, so firstly I would like some sensible discussion not ""hurr durr"" on this. What is the likelihood in your opinion that crypto is nothing but an entire financial industry built around ""The Emperor's New Clothes""? I am not saying that, for example Bitcoin isn't a truly great concept or that the use of the Blockchain for supply management etc isn't valid, I mean the expectations that any but a select few are worth anything at all. At the moment the entire market, other than possibly Bitcoin is ""But one day Goys it will be...... insert some explanation about a predicted future....be worth millions"" Even if we accept some value, it's likely with time and technology advancement the various types will be surpassed, effectively meaning it's a asset with a sell by date."

CryptoCurrency,"Use Bearmarket to make Money with ETF short possitions. Trade ETF\`s short options!! Make money in a bearish market!! For all that don´t know what it is. With ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds) you can easily and cheaply invest in stocks and build up long-term wealth. An ETF is an exchange-traded index fund that tracks the performance of well-known market indices one-to-one. ... In essence, ETFs combine the advantages of stocks and funds in one product. How does it works? ETFs - Exchange Traded Funds - work in a similar way to traditional funds: They can be traded on the stock exchange like stocks and replicate a securities index. In most cases, ETFs are passively managed index funds. ... This means that ETFs are just as secure as actively managed funds. I use ETF short options on gate.io to offset my losses with other stocks in the bear market. Gate.io offers a lot of different ETF possitions. This exchange is one of the largest worldwide and in my oppinion the Best. For beginners it looks a bit complicated but after short times it is easy to understand und use. It´s not only the ETF, it is the complete offer. So many possibilitys like Grit Trading, HODL and Earn … and and and. But for this here are the ETF short importent. So when you will make Money with downward going Markets than is this the Best way to do it. 

Use this link [https://www.gate.io/signup/3077038](https://www.gate.io/signup/3077038) and start!

But dont forget to watch it! When the market recover and price go up than short possitions crash. Understand? Last thing is an advice. When you will use gate.io than please pass the complete verification process first!!! Make your own research and invest only what you can handle to loose!!!"

CryptoCurrency,"An Experience: Joined when the bull market ended 1 week later. I joined crypto when my friend started talking about how he got massive profits, little do I know the bull market ended 1 week later. All I can say is I did not regret joining crypto and I'll continue to hold. I did not blame my friend, instead, I'm glad I got more knowledge about investments and how to be financially smarter.

When I entered, everything was practically at All-Time-Highs, I remember reading articles after articles and researching on the coins that I'm interested in. Bought ETH at 4k, ADA at $2. Used most of my money to buy at those prices, which made me unable to average down more when a crash happened.

As a student, there is nothing much I can do, I used my bursary from school(due to academic results) to buy ETH and ADA, and I have no part-time jobs. All I can do is to save my pocket money to buy more ETH every week, even if it is as little as $10.

There are times when I force a trade by selling and hoping the price would go down. This is a mistake that cost me quite a sum. After the losses, I just dollar cost average weekly.

CryptoCurrency,"I am buying the DIP -- bulls are stronger than you think This is not 2018-2019 and definitely not 2015 . There is a huge interest around crypto:

Three of the most important figures in investing / innovation  in the world  (Musk, Wood, Dorsey) are going to discuss bitcoin tomorrow.  Bitcoin is mainstream. 

Coinbase IPO was one of the biggest IPOs in 2021. Who would imagine this success a few years ago? 

Michael Saylor basically YOLOed on Bitcoin. 

The FED keeps printing money and US govt. keeps spending like there is no tomorrow. This means more money for retail and other investors to invest. 

A lot of amazing crypto projects and more applications and usage cases. 

In my opinion what we saw in the last few days is only a correction (also in the stock market and oil) because of new COVID fears.  Very risk averse investors are going to 10 years bond or the dollar. This trend won't continue in my opinion and then bull market can return very fast. 

I bought today BTC and some of my other favorite coins (ETH, LINK, MATIC, UNI, DOGE, AMP, etc). This is NOT a financial advice but only my opinion. 

It's going to be very volatile so don't spend money you need in the short term and don't use leverage."
CryptoCurrency,"Crypto Coping &amp; Exit Strategy I first got into crypto during the great bull run of 2017/2018. I used to look on Reddit for information and advice. During the bull run the only advice I saw was to HODL and buy and how ""we were all so early"" I bought at the peak, then the price plummeted. Then Reddit changed into exit strategies and how it *couldn't have been more obvious* that the bull run was coming to the end.

I felt like such an idiot for believing the hype and owed to never let myself get swept up in the drama. Then the 2021 bull run happened. 

I managed to get my money back from 2017/2018 and kept thinking ""I missed the crypto boat last time, but not this time"". Of course I got in too late and this time put an additional £3.5k (around $4.7k) into questionable cryptocurrencies that either I will never see a return from, or will have to wait several **years** to see a return.

Once again, on Reddit, the [of course the bull run is over, it was clear to me](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/onwgoq/im_tired_of_all_these_useless_posts_saying_it_was/) chatter has started. Once again I felt stupid and got swept up in the hype.  Reddit crypto history, it seems, does repeat itself.

Now, seeing a new suicide prevention hotline posts, I've decided for my sanity to DCA £50 (around $70) a month into crypto and unsubscribe from most of the crypto subreddits I am in. For my financial situation:

1. £50 is an amount I can very comfortably give, especially in this bear run
2. DCA is a way better long term strategy than YOLOing thousands at once
3. Crypto investing is *clearly* addictive (for me), but the potential returns mean I still want to invest so I don't miss out. Which means I have to be in much earlier and exit much sooner.
4. It difficult to try and wean myself off crypto but also check various crypto subreddits several times a day. If something moons, it will appear in r/all. If anything of great significance happens, my friends, my wife, Facebook, other news sources will inform me. 

In terms of my exit strategy...I don't really have one. Never needed to think of one. Was wondering what the communities perspective was? I think ideally I would want to have enough to not have to work full-time and could help my family out. I wondered if there was any website or any rough guide on when to take the profits and run **and** be content with what you have."

CryptoCurrency,"Are new investors late for ETH and BTC? Now I know this question has been probably thrown in this sub before, but I'm looking for a more specific answer.

I been in crypto since March this year, I'm still green as hell but I like to think that I'm heading in the right direction. As of now, I don't have BTC or ETH on my portfolio, mainly because it feels as if these two coins experienced most of their growth already, I know how market cap works, so I know that ADA for example is not going to reach 60k, but I still see a possibility for it to 10x, maybe this year, maybe next year. But the more I dig into the rabbit hole (which only keeps getting deeper and deeper) I can only question myself: Should I buy BTC and ETH? Is it worth diversifying my portfolio by adding these 2 monsters?

The thing is, I can't put in more than 100 dollars a month (DCAing) because that's what I can ""afford to lose"", so it kinda feels like I would have to put more time (ergo, more money)  into  BTC or ETH than I would with ADA or ALGO, for example, to get more gains in a ""shorter period of time"". Is it worth aiming for the sun with BTC or ETH for someone like me, a small shrimp in this market of whales?

CryptoCurrency,"An extended version of the monkey story Just saw the monkey story here. Let me add to that.

So once upon a time in a village, a man appeared and said that he wanted to buy monkeys for $10 each. The villagers start to catch monkeys and sold them to him and as supply started to diminish, the villagers stopped their effort. 

After some time, he increased the price for monkeys to $20. Villagers again started catching monkeys. The supply started dwindling even further and villagers stopped.   The offer increased to $25 each and the supply of monkeys became so little that it was even hard to see a monkey. 

The man now announced that he would pay $50 for monkeys but he is leaving for business and his assistant will handle the trades.

In his absence, the assistant told the villagers; that they can buy all the monkeys the man has collected for $35, and when the man returns from the city, they can sell them to him for $50 each.

The villagers got excited and rounded up all their savings and bought all the monkeys. They never saw the man nor his assistant, only left with monkeys!

This was about Crypto Market, now let's talk about goats.

There was another village nearby. Similar to the previous village, a man appeared one day and offered $500 each for buying the goats. 

Goats are valuable, but villagers judged that $500 for a goat is a pretty sweet deal. So the villagers sold their goats to this man and supply started to reduce. 

After some time, the man increased the price of the goats to $750, so the villagers started capturing wild goats to sell them off to the man. Finally, the man increases the price of each goat to $1000, but the supply was very low and villagers were not able to get more goats.

Here also, the man left his assistant to handle the trades, and the assistant offered the goats for $850, which they can sell to the man for $1000 when he returns. The villagers joined all their savings and bought all the goats.

Here too, both the man and his assistant disappeared and never came back. Villagers were left with goats everywhere.

But there is a difference between both the villages.  

Goats aren’t monkeys. Goats could provide milk every day which can be used for different products and is healthy. The goat droppings could be used as manure. When the goats go grow too old, the villagers could kill them for meat. All in all, it wasn’t a complete disaster.

But on the other hand, the monkey village is not so lucky. The monkeys ate too much, shouted and shrieked all day, and even sometimes bit people. Eventually, it became clear that the monkeys were worthless, the village abandoned them and tried to forget about their losses.

Now you know the difference between Good coins and Shit coins.

FYI: Nobody knows shit, DCA all the way. Be a bear in this bear market and just go to sleep."

Step 4 (optional): If the prices keep falling down, just change your currency for something like the Japanese Yen"
CryptoCurrency,"Yes, be patient and all - But what should you really do? **1. Try to control your emotions and your breathing.**

Breath control techniques are all over the web and are actually working and soothing. Meditation is a way, thinking about nothing is one other. Note that in case it gets too overwhelming and you feel like it's useless, definitely call a family member or a confidante, or in extreme cases do not hesitate in any way to hit up a suicide hotline.

**2. Organize your portfolio**

If you're a trader, I doubt you'd be highly stressed, so this part focuses on the holders. As a holder you have two options, either let it be, or turn all of your funds to a stablecoin (DAI/USDC preferred but pay attention to the gas fees) or fiat if you're on exchanges. Do this only if you feel like it'll go lower and you can't tolerate that in any way.

CryptoCurrency,"Observations about my first Bear Market This is my first bear markets and like many or not, I'm hype to see all these discounts and dips and of course, wish I could buy more... 

I really think high of the statement of ~bull markets make money, bear markets make you rich~as you have a better ROI with btc bought at 30k when you expect it to hit 100k rather than buying it at 50-60k. 


Now, we don't live in a perfect world and indeed it hurts when we bought at ath or you see your portfolio in red down by 50% but if you didn't invest more than you can afford yo lose, panic selling will just make things worse. You will turn these loss on paper, real! Don't let a day or many days in the red sea take you away from the life and dreams you've started already. (Also generally speaking, everything done in panic really turns out good)


If you cannot DCA anymore, stake. If you already stake, wait. Earn those % wherever you can.

CryptoCurrency,"Thoughts About the Binance FUD from the viewpoint of a hobby investor. Am I the only one who thinks that the bank attack against Binance made it easier for me to deposit?

I am from EU. Can't deposit via SEPA from my bank any longer.
BUT! The deposit via card is free now. 
I use my card issued of the same bank. Works like a charm.

SEPA takes 4-6 hours to reach Binance. 
With card deposit it takes only a few seconds. Same conversion rates. No fees from my bank either.

I feel that it is much better for me.

Withdraw issues? Nope. 
If I want to withdraw some money I can simply use the Binance Visa card to pay for everyday expenses (and get my cashback too).

CryptoCurrency,"Storing BAT on something other than Uphold? Hi all, my question seems simple but I can't seem to find an answer. I have recently started using the brave browser as an experiment and because I like the concept of the basic attention token.

My question is: is it possible to use a different wallet without having to transfer it every once in a while?

CryptoCurrency,"what you should really do in the crypto bear Market Go outside, live your life, and forget that crypto exists.

The biggest mistake people do is get consumed by the incessant candles of day trading. Doing trend analysis, taking part in pump and dumps or simply riding a wave for a few percent profit before exchanging it back (swing trading). While there are some experts who can do this sustainably, like any market, the algorithms (bots) set up to arbitrage and trade for low prices means the average investor doesn’t stand a chance.

In a bear market it might be best to keep your mind off cryptocurrencies, because the long term trajectory for this tech is only one direction – up. The minutiae of short term movements only matters if you’re not in this for the long haul."

CryptoCurrency,"Staking is making you less money than you might think. Let's showcase one example. For Tezos the inflated amount of coins (i) is about 4.9% and the rewards for the bakers (r) are about 6%. So if you are a baker your real inflation is  (1+i)/(1+r)-1 what is about -1%. So you are closer to 1% gains with baking Tezos than you are to the highlighted 6 percent. Fun fact: For Tezos the number is equivalent to how many people are not staking Tezos. If every Tezos would be staked the formula would result in +-0.

Keep this in mind when so see high staking rewards. I fall for it way to often when I saw high staking rewards on Binance. Staking rewards between 30% and 100% might make you money, but these coins are often highly inflationary."

CryptoCurrency,"What is the most interesting Bitcoin story you heard/ lived through? 
Back in 2013, a friend and I were watching the prices rise and decided that at $200 a piece, Bitcoin looks like a good buy - we’ve decided to “invest” a few thousand shekels into it. At the time it was difficult to acquire Bitcoin - you couldn’t just get some with a credit card. There were various creative and tricky ways to obtain “digital gold” but most were either too complicated or took too long.

The easiest, most straightforward way was through “dealers” - simply buying ‘coins for cash.

Through a mutual acquittance we’ve received contact details for a prime Bitcoin “dealer” in our area. We were told that the guy is very private and won’t just sell to anybody. We had to be introduced and meet in a designated location for the transaction. I’ve gotta admit, this sounded really fishy. I couldn’t help but see the parallels between our situations and a drug deal.

Still, we’ve decided to risk it. We contacted the guy via email and quickly agreed on an amount, meeting time and location. So, my friend and I took out some cash, a laptop, and drove to the designated meeting location in order to carry out the exchange.

When we got there (it was a cafe), we had to wait for about 20 minutes until the guy showed up. We were sitting there, cash on hand, nervous for what’s about to happen… Well, whaddaya know? The big bad “dealer” we were nervous to meet was this 13 year old kid sitting on a Bitcoin stockpile that he mined a couple of years earlier when it was easy. We’ve ended up sharing a a drink, making the exchange and laughing at the absurdity of the situation.

That kid made some serious dough - I wonder what he’s up to today…"

CryptoCurrency,"Bitcoin price July 2013 - $66, December 2013 - $1163. July 2017 - $1830, December 2017 - $19700. This is standard bull cycle consolidation (Fibonacci Analysis) **The Golden Ratio**

Some of you may not know about Fibonacci ratios but that's ok. I will not overcomplicate this post and you don't necessarily need to be a TA expert to understand it.

Suffice to say, these ratios, particularly what's referred to as the golden ratio (1.618), are ubiquitous in all nature and cosmos.

Fans of Dan Brown's The Da Vinci Code will remember when the protagonist Professor Langton explains how mathematics and art collide via the 'golden ratio.'

The golden ratio is sometimes called the ""divine proportion,"" because of its frequency in the natural world. The number of petals on a flower, for instance, will often be a Fibonacci number. The seeds of sunflowers and pine cones twist in opposing spirals of Fibonacci numbers. Even the sides of an unpeeled banana will usually be a Fibonacci number—and the number of ridges on a peeled banana will usually be a larger Fibonacci number.

Space-time itself is defined by this mathematical constant. Naturally, we humans, are somehow programmed to act in accordance with this ratio in everything we do.

**Golden Ratio in Bitcoin**

Bitcoin's price action right now is following the exact same pattern that it did in 2013 and in 2017. Let's take a look. These charts are easy to follow,

[Bitcoin's first big run, new ATH and correction to 1.618 \(2011-2013\)](https://preview.redd.it/j2u8clq9jbc71.png?width=1558&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=74e56a0dc2336f070bfc13ef706b3bdf7b791167)

[Exact same price action between December 2013 to July 2017](https://preview.redd.it/pk6k8lqljbc71.png?width=1558&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=82e53724ca3b512e7a51e5b984e4ac39ef9c08a4)

[Exact same price action between December 2017 to July 2021](https://preview.redd.it/9s8y9f3sjbc71.png?width=1559&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e5f7482966ee5736b427ac45e3982ca3d5961263)

When Steve Wozniak called Bitcoin a mathematical miracle, he wasn't kidding. Whatever makes the price action rhyme this way between halving cycles can be analyzed by humans similar to the patterns in nature but never fully understood.

It once again begs the question if Mathematics was invented or discovered.

I was already super excited 3 years ago to observe whether the same pattern would play out again. To see it play out exactly the same way is nothing short of spine-chilling.

I'm wound up in a tremulous horripilation of incredulity!

You can check out the two pinned posts on the profile.

In February 2018, when everyone was panicking, I pointed out that we would go back to 19k and beyond in the next cycle.

Back then, I hadn't yet analyzed the price action this closely but I knew the cycles.

Then in December last year, I called for $100k before the end of 2021 which I still stand by.

In my personal opinion, it's very likely that 29k is the bottom for this correction phase.

But you should of course DYOR."

- I’ve been here before, but much much worse. Back in 2017/18 I bought in at ATH following the hype and with little idea what I was doing. My gains quickly fell and fell hard. It’s was a horrible feeling but I held for 3 years and even with that dumb guess work and some of the projects dying out or making a loss, I still ended with an overall profit. 

- cliche one. I’ve only invested what I can afford to lose. I’m fighting the urge to put more money in even now but I’m sticking to my plan. 

- most important one… I’ve picked projects that I really believe in. I’m only investing in two coins currently and I’m DCA into to those each month. Seeing the price of everything fall is a lot less concerning when you’re in a solid project, and even more so when they’re holding up better than alts around them. 

- having seen it before, I’m comfortable with these ups and downs.  I’m here for the long term. Having a bit of perspective about market cycles is good for the mind.

Those people especially new investors that bought recently, please do not buy now. This is how u lose money and have countless sleeps because each day the price just keeps getting lower and lower and it will impact your daily life. Do not sell now, because I know you won't.

What you should do is to..just stop trading for now. I have been telling people here and my peers to stop trading since btc hit 55k (of course, they laugh at me saying price will reach 100k, 400k etc). Meanwhile start studying about technical analysis, it is a great tool like for a start, it will help you to lose LESS money. As you progress, it will definitely help you to make money. 

Wait till the trend starts to really reverse, could be now, could be 25k, 20k whatever.  The point is accumulate your fiat and enter at the next CONFIRM trend reversal and watch the next golden cross and the cross over 21ma. That is how I all in when btc was 5k in 2019.

If any of you had been paying attention to the all time high indicator, you would have noticed that it hit an all time high on 10th May. This is obvious to anyone with TA skills. It also didn’t go higher than 65K so you should have sold at 65K. The truth is that the bears took control on this day, when BTC was at its all time high. 

The crucial bit of information is that the price didn’t go higher than the all time high. Smart money realised this and sold their Bitcoin precisely at the top.

Regardless of our belief in crypto and the future, 99.9% of the world economy is in the stock, bond, currency market. 

I don’t try to time the stock market, as I have been burned loads of times and lost money, so my plan is just to ride it out and add more in companies I believe in if I can. Same with crypto. If and when the economy crashes crypto will get slaughtered, yes it can go down even more. 

So yea, it’s worth keeping an eye on all financial instruments so you’re better aware of the movements for your crypto. 

My only advice is to practice patience. Don’t throw money into every dip, wait for consolidation. It’s absolutely ok to miss out on a few % gain on the way up in a bull market! Remember, 50% drop requires a 100% gain just to break even…

TLDR: just useless long text to say be patient, hodl and follow the financial market as well."
CryptoCurrency,"Investing with Nexo If you move some of your investments into Nexo and the value of your position increase, does it reflect on their platform?

CryptoCurrency,"This stagnation in price of Crypto is the best time to get your mind off for a while, recover and return back when better days are ahead. I was in a mad DCA spree several months ago when prices saw some of their lows and dumped money to accumulate whenever I could. I used to check the news, prices and track my portfolio daily to see a good time to sell or buy and it really took over alot of my time.

I finally made up my mind I will control how much I put into this asset and take some time off it, limiting it to only once a week and never touching it during the weekends.

And its been a good detox from this soo far, at times I even forgot I had a investment because of the time I spent on things other than Crypto.

If you're in this for the long run trust me several days or weeks away from this can do wonders and keep your interest in crypto growing, or else you'll just crash and burn."

Now the same people say everything was clear months ago, the bear market was easily predictable because you should check the IRS, the MAC and the F**K.

Could you just shut up? All this data is easy to understand AFTER something happened.

Everyone can look at the chart now and say that months ago prices were starting to go down, the problem is that it's impossible to know it before it happens.

So the IRS showed that volume started to go down in February, so the bear market was predictable. Great, and how you could know on February what would happen in the next days? How could you know that the volume wouldn't grow in the next days?

Even know, how could you know what will happen? Maybe next week Apple will buy 3 billions $ worth of BTC and price and volume will grow like crazy and we'll enter in a bull market, how your analysis will predict that?

CryptoCurrency,"We are not in a Bear Market. Hello all,

I have done extensive research and spent hours studying charts and diagrams, comparing the last few months to previous Crypto cycles. The conclusion?

*The bull market has only just started.*

  
Reason 1:

This chart (Figure 1) indicates we still have a long way to go before we reach the peak of the bull.

&amp;#x200B;

[Figure 1. Upwards movement of crypto over time = profits](https://preview.redd.it/rmiguhcw7bc71.png?width=220&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dd1e3dc029d62543283f1ea8fecfe28e200de974)

&amp;#x200B;

How can you argue with this clear indication of upward momentum? This is a strong market indicator that the market is healthy.

&amp;#x200B;

Reason 2: 

There are huge profits still to be made. The average investor can expect to see this (Figure 2) in their wallets by the end of the week....

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[Figure 2. Money and profits are good to have](https://preview.redd.it/hs3jcjdd8bc71.png?width=293&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d08f23b968967d1c12d3a7b84c2c8528bb76ad46)

&amp;#x200B;

If you don't like money, sell now. I guarantee anyone who holds will receive MONEY if they hold for the next couple of days.

&amp;#x200B;

Reason 3:

I personally don't want to lose and money. I would rather have profits now than wait a couple of years. Therefore, we have to be in a bull market or I will scream.

CryptoCurrency,"Just my luck. 48H ago I had this wonderful idea that I should move my investment from cEX to dEX, since binance may start closing withdrawals, or it may get hacked, etc. I just wanted my funds with me so I proceeded to exchange my USDT to DAI. 

I started withdrawing the DAI in the BSC network since the fees were minimal (Mistake #1)

Now I wanted the DAI to be totally free from Binance's control so I thought I would exchange the DAI (BSC) to DAI (ERC20) using Omni chain.

At the time of exchange the transaction cost was around a few bucks so I thought why not, Binance's own BSC to ERC costs 15 Dai to exchange 50 Dai but Omni costs peanuts compared to that.

Well guess what guys, after converting my (BSC) DAI to Binance Pegged DAI, I can't claim it back cuz Gwei jumped from 8 to 40 and still remains in that range. 

I have increased my gwei count to 9.8 but it's still in pending because the Gwei has barely dropped.

Now you would think I would stop there, but no, I bought some Uniswap and Sushi Swap for staking, transfered again via BSC network (Mistake #2) 

Created a new liquidity pool in Sushi swop for USDC/Sushi which costs 5$, and added my remaining Sushi/Uniswap to an already existing pool. 

Yet again, I'm fucked again cuz I can't farm my LP tokens that I got for those shares on Sushi Swap BSC network. 

Now here's the third installment to really hit me in the balls, I transfered 20$ to my Wazrix account via Binance - Wazrix transfer feature. I had done so in the past for Arbitrage expirments and I thought I would do it again.

Well guess what! Indian Enforcement Directorate put a ""show cause notice"" 2H before my transfer for Wazrix because they let people transfer between Binance and Wazrix without KYC, which is now a big No No for India's ED.

So I can't transfer it back to my Binance account untill I my KYC is approved on Wazrix, but you would think my luck would start to pickup, but no I spent an hour chatting with the Wazrix staff about why my KYC which I applied for on May 8Th hasn't been approved yet. 

After a few hours I get an email saying my kyc is rejected because the images were not clear, any attempt to reupload the image results in a ""National ID already taken"" error.

They still haven't replied to my emails yet.

I also transfered my entire ETH portfolio to Block Fi yesterday. Which is now under the sights of New Jersey's Regulatory Authority ༎ຶ‿༎ຶ"

You see that last entry? That was purchased today. Right at the current dip. Brave has done this before. This is why BAT token generally dumps less in comparison to other tokens. And buying the dips actually profits Brave Inc because they get more tokens which have the potential to go up significantly higher in the future.  


When advertisers pay Brave Inc, they pay in USD. Brave Inc uses that to buy BAT tokens. So, the lower the price of BAT the more BAT brave can buy. The more they buy, the more they get as the 30% cut. Also, brave ads users like me also benefit as we also receive more BAT tokens.

Brave has about 11 million active users. Recently, it has been buying tokens worth 1-2 million every month."

The thing is, most of them put more than they can afford to lose into it. Say, 80% of their life savings have been put into crypto and see -60% from ATH. If they were only put like 10-20% of their savings, I bet they can hodl just fine and don't think about it, and keep doing DCA.

CryptoCurrency,"TA that explains JP Morgan's $23,000.00 BTC This is going to be basic TA based on the  RSI, MA and EMA you are good 

Firstly the 21 Weekly EMA has become resistance; from previous support 

This means any attempt to go higher is blocked by it. Historically a 1st attempt is rejected and we get a lower low then an upswing past it. So it will act as the roof from now on. It is currently at $45,000.00

There was a 50/50 sell signal

A close bellow the 50 weekly MA

Resistance at the 50 RSI 

Last time we had a 50/50 sell we stayed below the 50 MA for a year. Currently the 50MA is at $32,000.00 

We have repeatedly tested the 50 MA and been rejected with lower lows.

The next major line of support is the 100 MA at ~$20,000.00

Personally shorting and up now 12% total portfolio in the last 24hrs. If we make it to $20,000.00 could 2x to 5x my portfolio 

Covering some shorts but if we go past $28,000.00 I suspect the over 50,000 BTC longs will start getting liquidated and hitting  stop losses 

This will cause a run off event that due to current liquidity issues could see us below $20,000.00 briefly. I may suffer FOMO then and go all in but with a trailing stop loss as the bounce back from it as shorts convert to longs could be a $5000.00 BTC price pump"
CryptoCurrency,"Would you invest in a coin that is backed by a network of homes?🏠 The vision:  A coin backed by a network of homes that people actually live in. After all, few things could be as tangible or as real as the home you live in. And real estate is one of the most stable asset classes, at the same time also keeping pace with inflation unlike fiat pegged stablecoins. So while this coin may not be stable in terms of its peg to fiat, it is more stable in terms of preserving purchasing power. Just as importantly, it provides an alternative to fiat or gold.

&amp;#x200B;

The hope is that pegging it to real estate would mean that it keeps up with inflation and with lower volatility, could make it suitable for daily purchases and transactions. It might also lower the cost of borrowing which could make Defi more competitive with Cefi. Eg, with interest rates around 10% who would take out a home loan in crypto when fiat interest rates are 1-3%? Or just reduce the collateral needed.

&amp;#x200B;

A brief overview of how it would work is that the money raised for this coin would go towards a co-investment in people’s homes. The co-investment will be paid back when the homeowner sells their house or after a predetermined number of years eg 30 years. The money can then be used to co-invest in another home.

&amp;#x200B;

If you're wondering where the homes that back this coin would come from, here's where the idealistic part comes in.

The first group is renters, so many people are renting when they hope to own their own homes, instead of paying a landlord why not build up your home equity and wealth instead? The co-investment could fast forward their homeownership dreams by years by coming up with the down payment and other upfront costs.

The second group faces systemic discrimination such as women, racial and sexual minorities or even just singles who don’t benefit as much from governments’ family planning policies and subsidies. They typically take a long time to save up for a down payment if ever, a co-investment can be very empowering by making up for the shortfalls in the system immediately.

The third group is those who already have a home and may still be paying off their mortgage and want to tap into their home’s equity. Some may have run into financial difficulties, some want to cash out a portion of their homes. Instead of taking a home equity loan which results in more debt that you have to pay interest on, a co-investment gives a debt-free way to tap into their home equity.

CryptoCurrency,"With DeFi being the total mess that it is, what do we actually expect is going to hold crypto up? I’m surprised I haven’t seen this perspective around but if it’s been posted before then my apologies. It may also be very unpopular. 

I understand DeFi and crypto have given so many people the opportunity to generate wealth and do better for themselves. Every time I see a news headline about what makes crypto the future I see DeFi being the first thing listed but after spending several months in the space, I have become beyond skeptical.

DeFi is basically a glorified casino. It’s riddled with scams, and most of the projects that end up being legit almost certainly die spectacular deaths within a week or a month of listing. Legitimate projects that have some sort of use case often don’t amount to much and the ones that really do the numbers are dog or other meme themed. It’s a total shit show and I feel as though the world media is yet to wake up to this. What happens when they do? 

Further, with governments around the world starting to crack down on crypto and express interest in creating their own digital currencies I’m just concerned the high from this year may be just that for a very long time - these issues were not nearly as evident prior to the bull run. The world has operated on centralised systems from the dawn of mankind until now, and country borders aren’t just going to disappear.

I also feel that while many technologies such as VeChain are making use of crypto, there’s no real reason the technology employed really needs crypto to run.

My apologies for the pessimistic outlook, I’m really looking for people to help me out with what reasons crypto has to continue doing well. I’m still holding and will continue to but unfortunately I’ve become well skeptical about my investment."
CryptoCurrency,"Perspective - Something Positive So, we're down well over 50%, more so if you're in alts. It's tough right now. Tougher still if you bought in the last couple of months on a ""correction"", which proved to continue to correct further. 

Yet, it's good to remember that fundamentally, nothing has really changed since May. Miners leaving China, USDT issues, a bearish TA pattern, some billionaire's Tweets... none of those things are really *fundamental* to the concept of cryptocurrencies and the wider benefits of blockchain technology. We're dealing with a nascent asset class, one with considerable and still untapped potential. The technology behind the funky-looking icons is amazing. There's a lot of crap out there, yes, but there's also some amazing projects with current and future utility.

I'm addition, let's not forget that only a few months ago, we were at ATHs. Sentiment flipped in a very short space of time, cumulating to where we are now. We could still go lower. But remember that sentiment can also flip the other way too. Charts can only tell you so much - all of it historical - so don't just put all your faith in lines on a chart. Remember that sentiment is fluid and it can - will - change. It can also change very quickly, with little rhyme or reason. So as we're trending into more red candles below $30K BTC, remember that the narrative is not fixed.

Crypto is a fast-paced market. You can be down -20% in a day and up 20% the next. It's volatile. It's why it's very risky, but can also be very profitable.

So I say be patient. View your crypto assets as investments - as opposed to short-term bets or punts - and take the long-view. This asset class has been declared dead before and will be again. But my money's on the positive and I highly doubt May's prices represent the pinnacle forever more. 

I'm not telling you to buy, I'm not telling you to sell, but rather to keep the fundamentals in-mind whether the market travels lower or higher.

Stay well all."

CryptoCurrency,"In times like this… Good reminder that Cryptocurrencies like Btc and eth can experience daily (or even hourly) price volatility. As with any kind of investment, volatility may cause uncertainty, fear of missing out, or fear of participating at all. When prices are fluctuating, how do you know when to buy?

Short answer is to DCA. If you are new, and aren’t sure what it means, here is a short commentary: 

DCA is a long-term strategy, where an investor regularly buys smaller amounts of an asset over a period of time, no matter the price (for example, investing $100 in Bitcoin every month for a year, instead of $1,200 at once). Their DCA schedule may change over time and — depending on their goals — it can last just a few months or many years


Just a reminder that if you think crypto prices are going up in 5-10 years from now, the best way might be to DCA to block out the noise (short term volatility)"
CryptoCurrency,"The Bull Run Ended in February 2021. What the whales DON'T want you to know. The bull run didn't end in May. 

And no, we *didn't* start going down because of Elon or China FUD.

The truth is, the bears took control in February.  When BTC was at $47K.

Now, I know 2021 brought a lot of new people to Crypto. A lot of you guys don't know anything about technical analysis, so I'll break it down for you. There's an indicator traders like to use called the RSI or Relative Strength Index, which is used to track price momentum.

The crucial bit of information is that the RSI for BTC was overbought in February and started to decline each month, despite the price continuing to rise. This is called bearish divergence, which occurs when prices goes up but our oscillator prints a lower high. 

Smart money knows about this, because that's what makes them smart. That's why when BTC went from $47K, to $57K and higher, they were taking profits on the way up. Smart money moved their profits into stable coin at the top. If they were really smart, they shorted down to $30K as well.

The point is, that's how whales play the game. That's how they can buy the dip. It's why they have capital to deploy at $28K and below. Crypto is not broken. We don't need to come up theories like S2F or lengthening cycles. The warning signs were there in February. Anyone who doesn't understand that and is complaining how we didn't go to $200,000 this year was simply asking to get rekt. 

You won't hear this on YouTube or Twitter. Looking at most of the shitposts on this sub, I expect this analysis will get buried. I'm interested to see how well a genuinely informative post does. Let's see. Maybe this helps someone be smarter next time. 

Not FA, just TA."
CryptoCurrency,"Its simple, you are not at loss if you dont sell Seeing the chart bleeding is not equal to seeing the chart bleeding and selling

If you dont, markets will go up again in another cycle and new ATH will happen"
CryptoCurrency,"Scammer Alert! Hello my friends! As usual, if you receive a reddit chat invite from someone you haven't been in contact with before, it is 100% a scam! If you have been in contact with them and they ask for anything remotely resembling a financial transaction, it is also a scam!

My new acquaintance, u/btashaSsm, was so polite as to message me and let me know that they like to buy and sell Bitcoin. 

After a brief chat and them rejecting my offer of friendship, u/btashaSsm was still nice enough to offer me $500 per .01 BTC, even up to 1 whole BTC!

Enough people get scammed by dummies like this. If you get messaged by this person or anyone offering you ""hard to believe"" prices, please do your part and report/block them. We're all in this together! Thank you for reading."
CryptoCurrency,"Remember 2018 folks Ethereum, hit an ATH of over $1400, then about a year later after that ATH it crashed and went to $82. It was in a lull for about 2 1/2 years and then in 2021 it started $750-ish and then over $4300. Now as you can see it’s $17xx. If May drop to close (or more) than it’s previous ATH of $1400, it’ll recover folks. It what it does. Bitcoin does it better, but ETh handles it well-ish. 

Don’t freak out, don’t panic just enjoy the discounts. Look at it this way folks…..where do you see the price of Bitcoin, ETh etc…in the year 2030?  Is crypto dead? Do you see ETh at $40k?  Do you see ETh $10k?, $100k?  If you don’t think the market will crash to zero then you know for a fact your investment will payoff and the only question is what is the multiplier?

Patience is key. Imagine all the people who sold ETh 2019 when it was $82 and then it rose to $4300, even now at $17xx is still up almost 10x. Relax people, times are good, you don’t know it yet."
CryptoCurrency,"Honest question, would it be smart to put everything I have into a Bitcoin account? Instead of having a checking/savings account, how smart would it be to put everything into a Bitcoin account and get a card through whatever broker I go with, and just use that as my savings/checking? Cause if Bitcoin goes up (which it will) my savings will go up as well, meaning I gained free money for using a Bitcoin account instead of a checking/savings, right? 

I’m new to it all so roast me if you want or help me lol. Just trying to do what’s best for my short term and long term future. Also would like to get into Bitcoin while it’s low."
CryptoCurrency,XLM or MATIC? I've got a little extra cash on me and want to fill my bags. Which do you guys think should I buy? XLM or MATIC? They both are available on a good discount. Or you could suggest me other coins too. I am searching for coins which I can buy in high volume for little investment and not care about them for a year or two. I want like 1 dollar-ish coins or even with lower price.
CryptoCurrency,"I’m buying more tonight... I promised y’all I would due to my ability to cause markets to tank when I buy, so this is your fair warning post that I’m buying more eth, btc, and others tonight, and possibly for the rest of the week. 

This is just to make sure y’all are aware of the reason the market will continue to drop, I’m sorry I just can’t help myself and I have to fomo in to this dip. 

Insert story about hitting the word count: In college when we had essays I used to write it out and then if I was short on words, type random ones at the bottom of the page and change the text to white. Id then save it as a read only pdf so the professors couldn’t actually check the word count unless they counted each word out which they never did. If they asked about it I would just tell them that I was using a Mac and I’ve had problems with the Mac version of word being readable on non Macs (even though this wasn’t a thing)."
CryptoCurrency,"While the market is down, moons are 12% up Moon farmers are farming, moons are mooning, days are shorter, shorts are shorting. 

While the market is taking the long route to the moon on a flash red candle stick, moons are going up in value. They are taking the rightest route; it makes sense that they'd know the shortest way to the moon. Nearing a cent with their ascent, will they correct or is their title correct?"
CryptoCurrency,"Moons are the only Green Asset in my Portfolio  Yes you read that right, throughout this crash while every single crypto I own in my portfolio and even my watchlist has gone deep red, moons are the only one that's up intraday. Now this isn't to say moons are a better investment than BTC or ETH at all. Just thought that it was funny that a reddit token is outperforming the market. Bullish for moons I guess."
CryptoCurrency,"Unpopular opinion: I would love a bear market Yes, I know it’s terrible to see all our crypto’s bleeding. But this is the time to accumulate! You wanted a chance to make some serious gains and here is that chance! 

We know the market is cyclical at this point. We also know adoption is only growing more and more by the day. It is not a guarantee that it will go up, but the risk/reward for crypto looks very very good. 

So I welcome this drop. And I hope it drops more! It would be great to buy bitcoin around 19k again or lower. Not to mention all the alt coins I believe in, which will be super cheap. 

Finally, I hope a bear market would calm some of the ridiculousness in the space. No, bitcoin is not going to solve all of Earth’s problems anytime soon. And I also hope all these foolish scam tokens will slow down/stop during a bear market. 

My portfolio is red but I am actually thrilled and hope I can keep buying at low prices. Cheers!"

1. I used some crypto gains awhile ago and bought a German Shepherd who has made a huge positive difference in my life.
2. Got to spend quality time with my fam this summer
3. Hit a new PR in the gym (100lb dumbbell pressed 4 sets of 6)

We are held by the systems that keep us at bay
Held by the people who don't care what we say

We work for the rich and stay poor all our lives
We work so we can feed our children, our husbands or wives

CryptoCurrency,"One of the best way to DYOR. You read about a new project, read its whitepaper, look for it on coinmarkercap, read about the founders, watch YouTube, read the candle stick graph and do hundred other things to do the research. But it's always difficult to find the cons, because everyone is praising their coin.

Now to find the cons of a certain project. Suppose you want to research about SOL, then just go to any Crypto subreddit (other than SOL, go to ETH or BTC for example). Now on that community post some like ""why SOL is not better than ETH?"" Just frame your post in a way that people comment that cons for the Crypto that you've mentioned. Now in the comments you've got a list of cons, all you need to go is Google those cons. Finally make your decision."
CryptoCurrency,"Since nothing is going on, I’ve decided to generate a crypto. Welcome to “Intellectually-challenged BTC” BTC looked at the poop table in his hands and felt depress.

He walked over to the window and reflected on his see moonfarming surroundings. He had always loved depressing cyptoverse with its regurgitated, rabblesnatching reddit. It was a place that encouraged his tendency to feel depress.

Then he saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the figure of Poop Coin . Poop Coin was an arrogant shuly with poop ass and weird nose.

BTC gulped. He glanced at his own reflection. He was an intellectually-challenged, naive, piss tea drinker with fat ass and ginger nose. His friends saw him as a lively, loopy little. Once, he had even revived a dying, intellectually-challenged chad.

But not even an intellectually-challenged person who had once revived a dying, intellectually-challenged chad, was prepared for what Poop Coin had in store today.

The storm teased like falling pig, making BTC empty.

As BTC stepped outside and Poop Coin came closer, he could see the robust glint in her eye.

""Look BTC,"" growled Poop Coin, with a greedy glare that reminded BTC of arrogant whale. ""I hate you and I want to wake up. You owe me 6127 usd.""

BTC looked back, even more empty and still fingering the poop table. ""Poop Coin, flipping useless shitcoin,"" he replied.

They looked at each other with sad feelings, like two beautiful, better bat killing at a very slow apocalypse, which had regaton music playing in the background and two stupid uncles stepping to the beat.

BTC regarded Poop Coin's poop ass and weird nose. ""I don't have the funds ..."" he lied.

Poop Coin glared. ""Do you want me to shove that poop table where the sun don't shine?""

BTC promptly remembered his intellectually-challenged and naive values. ""Actually, I do have the funds,"" he admitted. He reached into his pockets. ""Here's what I owe you.""

Poop Coin looked grumpy, her wallet blushing like a tan, tough toilet.

Then Poop Coin came inside for a nice drink of piss tea.

CryptoCurrency,"Using multiple vaults on one account? Unfortunately my old phone took some serious water damage last week. It poured like crazy here in west germany^^. At least the display is dead. I'm using a replacement phone right now until i've figured out if i can repair the old one to restore some data.

I'm one of the fool who did not note their seed phrase. I thought my vault would be permanently synced to my reddit account, so there is no need for it. I just found out, that it's not the case. 

Now i'd like to know what would happen, if I created a new vault on the new phone to claim my latest destribution? Would my old vault 'desync' on my old phone and be replaced by the new one? If so, i wouldn't be able to access my moons even if I can repair the phone. That would be a bummer."

Tired of them raping you with high APR’s on loans and credit cards, tired of fees, tired of the dollar being devalued while corporation buy back their own stocks with your money so they can make more money on your money? Tired of the entire system raping you and controlling you so 1% can profit ?

CryptoCurrency,"Explaining ERGO; The coin to mine after Ethereum, or something more? 
Ergo has been a coin that is talked here every once in a while, but here's some basic information on ergo.


*History*


Ergo. Was devolped back in 2017 with a proof of work status. It never went over its ATH from late 2017, hitting around $22. Now it sits at $4 about $18 in may.

Ergo had no premine but the first couple years of ergo's existence was pretty lucrative. Although miners did take a cut of the rewards of mined ergo. When mining, and the devs made a lot of ergo off of it.

*Technology* 


The coin's proof of work algorithm doesn't allow Asics to be profitable, which in theory was to decentralize the supply since asics have a ton of power to mine specific coins. Ergo used to not allow pools to mine from, but removed that rule a while ago. When mining it's suggested that you mine with a gpu of 5gigs of vram for profitability. 

Fees were implemented with a standard deviation. High demand = high cost. Low demand = low cost.

The cap is 97 mill for ergo.. The current supply is 32~ mill. That's still a lot more to mine although rewards are going down by each halving. Ergo has a pretty bad scaling issue though being accused of higher fees.

ergo does have NFT inclusion. 

The top 100 people own 20%~ of the supply. Which isn't the best but is optimal for a smaller Coin.

Ergo works with smart Contracts! And had worked on building more powerful smart contracts, called multi stage contracts, oracles include information that move within the blockchains.

*What else*

Ergo, other than mining, has a good DeFi. It allows Dapps to be built on ergo. The creator of ADA had talked to ergo devs previously and ADA had tested on ergo's chain before, mainly about smart contracts


TLDR: Ergo after Ethereum will have a strong use case to mine. It doesn't have the best use case other than a good alt coin to mine *right now*. it has foundations set for a brighter future. Ergo started at the last bull run but never reached its ATH. Ergo has about 60%~ of its supply left to mine, includes a script to allow NFT's, but i haven't seen it being used much. The top 100 people hodling ergo own a nice 20% of the supply, which isn't good but not bad. Many complaints ergo has had in the past was scaling it to a larger market, although it looks like in the future they may solve many scaling issues."

I know there's no chance of retrieving any lost funds, but I found it fairly interesting how easy it would be to scam someone through a Coinbase Commerce account. There's no form of ID verification as you only need an email to open an account - just attach your payment link to any website and you're set. The link redirects you to a Coinbase payment page where individuals can transfer different cryptocurrencies as payment.  


Coinbase cannot retrieve lost funds and obviously cannot provide identification of whoever was running the account (even with all the transaction details; They've alerted me that they are working with a specialist to look into the matter but since it was a small amount lost (&lt;1500 USD) and that I haven't heard anything for three weeks, it seems that nothing more will be done.

She doesn’t really understand investing, she has investments but her sister manages them for her and she doesn’t even know what she’s invested in or how much money she has in it.

2 months ago I mentioned to her if she wanted to buy some Bitcoin, she has heard about it but has no idea what it is. She agreed that it seems like a good long term investment. But that was it.

2 months past and we didn’t talk about BTC at all until the price reared to around the low 30s again. Last week I mentioned that now seems like a pretty good time to buy and she very enthusiastically said she wanted to buy some.

I explained to her the risks and not to invest anything she isn’t ok losing. I asked how much she wanted to invest. “$5000” she said, taken back I ask her if she’s been serious, she responds “$10,000?” OK, she clearly has more fiat laying around than I expected. We agree $10,000 is too much and settle on $5000 which was 0.143BTC at the time.

Expecting a dip I waited a few days to buy in and today it came. 0.15BTC to satisfy my OCD and make her a little richer. I’m looking forward to been Bitcoin millionaires together.

CryptoCurrency,"Yeild Farming 101 **YEILD FARMING 101**

*Wall of Text Warning*

As we enter a potential Bear Market or Crab Market, it's becoming increasingly lucrative to Yeild Farm. Unfortunately, I don't think many people truly understand it. How it works, what there is to gain and also, most importantly the risks. 

Over the last half a year I have personally delved deep into DeFi and want to explain in my own words a little explaination of how the Crypto wild west really works. 

**WHAT IS LIQUIDITY PROVISION?**

A decentralised exchanged works by creating a pool containing two assets. Let's say on the Binance Smart Chain, PancakeSwap want to offer swaps between BNB and BUSD. A pool will contain a ratio of these two assets and in order to take out one, you must deposit the other. Many mechanisms essentially try to keep the value in the pool the same through all these swaps, but the ratio of the different assets might change.

This is decentralised because it removes the need for order books. Price is indicated by the current ratio of Crypto Assets in the pool, and since no-one needs to match a buyer with a seller and oversee the transaction like traditional order books do. The only interaction the user has is with a pool, which is implemented with a smart contract thus immutable and verifiable on the blockchain.

Unfortunately for this to work we need liquidity. This is where liquidity providers come in, they deposit their assets into the pool making sure both assets are of equal value. This increases the Total Value Locked into the pool and allows swaps to happen.

LPs earn a portion of all trading fees on the pool, in this instance PancakeSwap charges 0.25% as a trading fee on every swap. 0.17% goes to the LPs split between them with regards to how much liquidity they've provided.

https://imgur.com/a/zpby3I7

On our BUSD-BNB pair it took 144,000 USD of fees in one day!

**WHAT'S THE RISK?**

This sounds too good to be true. And many think it is. In reality it's a little muddier than that.

Impermenent loss is something that's thrown around a lot as a boogeyman. A reason to avoid Yeild Farming, and understandably so, it's a difficult concept to understand. However, hopefully we can go back to our example to explain how it works.

Esentially, when you provide liquidity you are allowing others to use your liquidity to swap between the two tokens you provide. You can't swap more tokens than exist in a pool, because they don't exist for you to swap between. When a token is in demand to be bought or dumped people are likely to want to swap away from one token and into another.

Say the price of BNB sharply decreases. Most weak hands are going to sell. Swapping in our pool to BUSD. However, as a liquidity provider we know we hold both assets, and giving up our BUSD to swappers means we're left with their BNB. If we withdraw our tokens now, we're going to end up with an imbalanced ratio to what we put in. Less BUSD and more BNB. 

However BNB isn't worth as much as when we bought it! If we now go to swap ours, we have more of it sure but it's worth less so we might *actually* be worse off than if we just held our BNB.

This works the other way too. If BNB sharply rises then BUSD sellers are going to buy BNB leaving us with less of the now more valuable token and more BUSD in return.

This is complicated to get your head around so give it another read if you need to.

The good news is twofold though.

* A. Impermenent loss is easy to mitigate if you're aware of what's happening in the crypto world.

* B. It only become permenent loss if you withdraw. The price of BNB might return to where you bought it, meaning you'll be able to withdraw roughly the amount you put in. 

It's also important to note Stable Pairs don't suffer from IL at all, and two volatile pairs will be far more risky as you must keep in mind two tokens could move in different directions.

**WHY WOULD I RISK IT?**

Well, luckily there's a third piece of good news. It's where Yeild Farming comes in.

DeXs want to incetivise LP. So, they allow you to deposit LP Receipts in the form of other tokens into a farm. These farms offer some insane APYs. How?

Most of them provide their results in the DeX's native token. For example PCS offers CAKE rewards for farming and back when Uniswap did their farms they offered UNI. LPs are betting that a native token is going to hold and increase in value, and of course high APYs can be offered since the protocol is minting or distributing pre-minted tokens at a set emission rate.

There is a potential worry for these native token to not be worth anything, or inflate massively in value, but with more and more usecases such as PancakeSwap profiles and Uni Governance the prices are most likely here to stay. 

Most farming reward will offset any IL, and chances are if you mitigate IL (Something I hope to explain more in a future post depending on demand) then you'll come out making some serious money.

The great thing is, with Crab Markets, moving to the side is exactly what LPs want.

**HOW DO I DO ALL THIS?**

I'm quickly going to show you how easy this is:

Here I am on ViperSwap. A UniSwap clone on the Harmony ONE network. I'm on testnet so I can work with a lot of ONE.

[ViperSwap Interface](https://imgur.com/a/Mfi6AB8)

First I need two tokens of equal value which I want to target.

[1BUSD-VIPER is looking *nice*](https://imgur.com/a/adsKNOt)

The interface might be a little different on different networks but by going to the pool tab I can provide liquidity. 

[Adding my tokens](https://imgur.com/a/LXTEtL3)

As you can see by adding 2 BUSD which = 0.9 VIPER, i'll now have contributed 5% of the pool. I have to approve both tokens, but on Harmony this is a very very small gas fee.

[Success!](https://imgur.com/a/lk9fsDB)

My liquidity has been added, and now I have some LP tokens to prove my liquidity exists. Now to go stake them.

[Depositing my LP Tokens](https://imgur.com/a/4eSOcxc)

I'm now earning passive income

[This testnet pool is ticking up about 0.5 VIPER per block mined](https://imgur.com/a/dLLFEAn)

There's a few caveats here. For example while ViperSwap is very cheap, it locks earnt VIPER in order to prevent dumping of the coins. PCS and all the rest DO NOT DO THIS.

Of course you'll have to do your own research into pairs, and platforms at the moment. There's also Yeild Aggregating with a platform like Beefy. Let me know if I can do any more of these guides. And of course, any questions please ask!"

According to [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/moon/), it's currently sitting at **$0.1045 USD**, relatively close to its ATH we had back in May.

It's more than doubled since June as well. Meanwhile Bitcoin is just a few hundred dollars from getting to $30K and all other altcoins are down marginally as well.

CryptoCurrency,"Would you back a stablecoin that is backed by your own home?🏠 The vision: A coin backed by a network of homes that people actually live in. After all, few things could be as tangible or as real as the home you live in. And real estate is one of the most stable asset classes, at the same time avoiding a peg to any one fiat.

&amp;#x200B;

The hope is that pegging it to real estate would mean it keeps up with inflation and with lower volatility could make it suitable for daily purchases and transactions. It might also lower the cost of borrowing which could make Defi more competitive with Cefi. For example, with interest rates around 10% who would take out a home loan in crypto when fiat interest rates are 1-3%?

&amp;#x200B;

A brief overview of how it would work is that the money raised for this stablecoin would go towards a co-investment in people’s homes. The co-investment will be paid off when the homeowner sells their house or after a predetermined number of years eg 30 years. The money that comes in can then be used to co-invest in another home.

&amp;#x200B;

If you're wondering where the homes that back this coin would come from, here's where the idealistic part comes in:

The first group is renters. So many people are renting when they hope to own their own homes, instead of paying a landlord why not build up your home equity and wealth instead? The co-investment could fast forward their homeownership dreams by years by coming up with the down payment and other upfront costs.

Yet another group faces systemic discrimination such as women, racial and sexual minorities or even just singles who don’t benefit as much from governments’ family planning policies and subsidies. They typically take a long time to save up for a down payment if ever, a co-investment can be very empowering by making up for the shortfalls in the system immediately.

The third group is those who already have a home and may still be paying off their mortgage and want to tap into their home’s equity. Some may have run into some financial difficulties, some want to cash out a portion of their homes. Instead of taking a home equity loan which results in more debt that you have to pay interest on, a co-investment gives a debt-free way to tap into their home equity.

CryptoCurrency,"Bitcoin &amp; ethereum vs JPOW &amp; the rise of the risk free rate I want to start a discussion about what the effects of a rise in interest rate will be on the value of Bitcoin and Ethereum. 

Let's say JPOW is right and the current bout of inflation is transitory and we don't see rates rise until the end of 2022 or 2023. I would feel safer investing in  Bitcoin and Ethereum. 

&amp;#x200B;

What if though inflation does continue increasing at a higher pace than previously thought and if rates rise sooner and faster than expected? Will the risk-free rate of return affect the demand of Bitcoin and Ethereum as wealthy people then could buy Certificates of deposits and see returns?

&amp;#x200B;

I currently have a small amount of Eth staked to turn into Eth2. I think I'm up a whole 5 cents right now in interest. Though the interest rate is suprisingly good at 5%. If rates start to rise will the interest for staked Eth rise? I did not get a disclosure on my interest rate when I staked my Eth.

to me the possibility of rising rates could be why were are seeing a bear market in crypto as people believe rates will rise soon and thus liquidating their crypto gains to take advantage of this if it does happen."

CryptoCurrency,"Math is hard 🤦‍♂️Help w/ calculating liquidation price of a leveraged crypto perpetual futures on KuCoin You know that point in life when you know you f'd up and the best you can do is damage control, that's where I'm at right now. So, any help you guys can provide would be much appreciated. I will try to keep it short and sweet. 

I will add that I have searched the internet and I can find numerous calculations online but they never add up or make sense to me. Mainly bc none of them focus on showing how to add to a current position to see where it's effect on liquidation price.


Here it goes:

I started trading USDT backed perpetual futures on leverage on KuCoin

I was of course confident the price wouldn't drop enough to liquidate my 5x leverage position.

As the price kept creeping lower I kept buying more to prevent liquidation, and kept digging a deeper and deeper hole. 

I want to know if there is a simple calculation to figure out my what my liquidation price would be if I buy X number of shares at Y price to my current position.

I don't even know what information is necessary for this calcualtion, so will list everything I see.


Currently:

Shares: 35,000
Entry Price: $0.7802
Liquidation Price: $0.5047
Margin: $2040
Realized PNL: -$201.62
Unrealized PNL: -$8322
Mark Price: $0.5426
Current leverage: 13.56x


So. Last time the market dropped and the price plummeted, I started buying more shares at the lowest point possible, right above my liquidation price and therefore moving my liquidation price down slightly. But as my stack grows it is of course taking more funds to do so. 

Now as the price is dropping again I have buy orders in, with no leverage, right above the current liquidation price as well as predicted next liquidation prices as well. Is this the best strategy?

I do have ""Auto-deposit margin"" on, but I don't trust it, plus if I am buying incrementally on the way down I feel like mathematically I should be able to extend my liquidation price even lower than just one big purchase right before the current liquidation price. Is that true?

Also, I currently have an extra $7k in the account to prevent liquidation. 

I basically want to figure out whether or not I should move more funds into the account just in case.

Any help with strategy or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!! Thanks!"
CryptoCurrency,"Unpopular opinion: My best friends know about my cryptobags Lot of times i read better dont tell your family or your friends about your bags. My best friends (we know each others for 20 years from school) are also in crypto, we all discovered crypto together so we all got in the same time, we all know how many BTC, ETH has each one, and which ones are our moonbets. If the day of tomorrow BTC goes to 1million no one will try to do anything with others money, in fact I'm glad that my best friends are in crypto and we have the confidence to talk about our belongings and don't have to hide things with them. A lot of times we talk about strategies, we are all independent and everyone has a different plan of action that works for each one, but sometimes someone brings up a good place of farming or other stuff that we can have in common. 

In my family only my father know about my bags, i talk with him because he has investing experience (not in crypto) and he has a good economic position so i know he will never ask me anything, from starts he has been always positive to me and pushed me to keep my path and do long term investment (being crypto or other if i chose to do so). To my mother and brothers i havent talked about it, i think they might know im in crypto, but i dont talk about my bags because im sure they will tell me to sell or stay away from it, why you didnt sold in 64k? etc etc...

CryptoCurrency,"Thank you people (SO SIMPLE, SO CALL IT THE CRYPTO COOKBOOK) ACAB! Hi, all of you 3.2m people from this sub. Only wanted to say I started with darknet, so I discover Btc, then crypto, and then crypto philosophy and revolution and f\*\*\* the banks. I was alone for 5 years, my friends bored about me speaking about that s\*\*\*\*, I was the crazy anarchist squatter guy. I failed and failed and failed, you know, it was difficult a few years ago to find good info. Had to learn by myself, had to discover on my own what was a scam. Had to discover I was a gambler and not a ""trader"", neither a Hodler. And I learned a bit.

&amp;#x200B;

Then only 5 months ago I discovered reddit, I discovered you people, I discovered I was not alone, I discovered the revolution was not going to start, but yet started, and not by a few ones, but by a huge and friendly and lovely community.

&amp;#x200B;

And I was happy, and I learned(learnt?) a lot, and I laugh a lot (discovered crypto memes that no one of my friends understood but I loved), said to my girlfriend look, finally found people like me, finally you're free of listen to me speaking about crypto 30 hours a day.

&amp;#x200B;

And finally I stopped gambling. I was here reading, laughing, learning and investing. I started to make some money. My friends and girlfriend saw maybe crypto was true and not only ""magic internet money"" used to buy drugs from \*\*\*\*\*\* and a kind of money you'll never touch or see cause it doesn't exist.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I can handle this shit and in two months I'm going to reach my dream, work from my pc, live wherever I want (aiming thailand, laos or around there) and fight for crypto and fight against banks, governments and their dogs (ACAB!).

&amp;#x200B;

I closed my bank account. I earn some Eth (to the moon) and use some for living and hold the rest. I'm free. I'm my boss, my bank and a comrade of a bigger thing. Don't need to throw molotov cocktels to the police or shoot your first minister (or king, dictator, etc...) in the face. No need to put bombs in banks or atm's. Do only your thing, spread the word, and change your shit of fiat for real money.

&amp;#x200B;

F\*\*\*\*\* s\*\*\*, I love to be living this period of the world history. From Vhs and Sega Megadrive to global warming, phones that spy you every minute and tell your secrets to Alexa, a f\*\*\*\* amazing Covid that have changed everything, and free people controling their money, exchanging it with no motherf\*\*\*\* in the middle taking his part (or government stopping you from using your own money in your own country). No fucking fee's ( a few, but enjoy a pool). Free people with decentralized money with no banks or other s\*\*\*\*.

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry people I'm fucking drunk and english is not my language but hope you enjoyed that s\*\*\*\*, and hope you are joining the f\*\*\*\* revolution and yeah fuck them!!!(i told you before banks and the system you know).

CryptoCurrency,"Researching the fundamentals of a project. I’ve posted my researching list on various comments and people seem to find it helpful so I thought I would take the time to go more in depth in the hopes people find it helpful. 

It can be daunting especially for newer investors to know exactly what to possibly research for new investments. This won’t include any TA or FA such as on chain metrics, rather proper researching into a project. 

Beyond checking whether a project is legitimate, you need to determine it’s possible future growth potential and where it fits within the crypto space. So here’s a detailed criteria of how I conduct research into projects and what I look for. 

1. Check both CoinGecko ( https://www.coingecko.com/en ) and CoinMarketCap (https://coinmarketcap.com) - these are both available in app form too. 

Both of these are data aggregators that essentially summarise important data such as prices, market cap overview, trading volume etc. What do I specifically look for in this first section? 

- Rank: I personally have a quick look at rank just to see where it’s at in relation to competitors. 
- Market cap: this gives an indication of possible future growth compared to competitors and the market in general 
- Total Supply: this can help determine the fully diluted valuation (total supply x current price) 
- Trading volume: this can help determine the liquidity of the asset. A project that has very little trading volume can lead to price manipulation and dramatic price movements by whales. 
- Exchanges: it’s important to see where the project is listed, this can help determine its exposure to investments and whether it’s in any reputable exchanges. 

Why do I use both? Simply this allows me to compare for differences and similarities. Furthermore, one may have more information such as a summary about the project. 

2. Look at Messari (https://messari.io) for profile information about the project

What is Messari? It’s essentially provides data and intelligence about crypto assets. It’s an absolute golden researching tool and resource. 

What do I look for? 

- there are options to look at the metrics, detailed overview etc. however what I’m interested in is the profile tab. This has a detailed history about the project, and also has information about regulation, governance of the project, token economics etc. 
- Also a tip for future potential findings for new projects is to look at what large funds are doing with their investments. For example you can view Coinbase Venture portfolio (https://messari.io/screener/coinbase-ventures-portfolio-34D634C4) 

3. Binance Research (https://research.binance.com) now this will be applicable if the project is a BEP-2/BEP-20 token, but this site can give some further information that could be valuable that you may have not collected so far at this stage. Here’s an example: https://research.binance.com/en/projects/bnb

4. YouTube education: by this stage you should have an ideal understand of the project and it’s background. However, you may not necessarily understand the technicals behind the project. If it’s a defi related project you may be lucky as this channel has a lot of detailed defi videos: https://youtube.com/c/Finematics. You can also try this channel that has short straight to the point explanations about hundreds of projects: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFQirr7pBWb520mjyY0wdiWDyS5BYw3MW 

5. Website: it’s important to look at the projects website. How the content is presented is important because you’ll be hoping it looks professional and not just having buzz words like “you’ll get x% amount of returns that the majority of scam projects will have. 

What am I looking for? 

- roadmap: it’s important to understand the future potential of a project. What updates is it planning to implement etc. 
- White paper: in my opinion a white paper is a must for any project because it’s supposed to display the academic layout of what the project is and the technology behind it. The more academic the paper is, the better. 
- Team: who are the founders and team members? Have they been involved in other projects? Have they got social media that you can check? Are they anonymous? (Now this can be a personal preference because some projects have anonymous creators and are legitimate, even Bitcoin in this case but many scam projects will also use anonymity to give an appearance of decentralisation). 
- Partnerships: what other projects are partnered, chainlink is a perfect example here due to the sheer amount of projects they collaborate with. 
- Blogs: some projects will have a dedicated blog post section on the website that gives important updates and news related to the project 

6. Certik: This organisation essentially audits crypto projects code (https://www.certik.org). The security score is important, but in my opinion it doesn’t necessarily tell you whether a project is legitimate or not. Why? Because the audit isn’t designed to be an investing signal, it is designed for the projects developers as the audit will identify any coding vulnerabilities that could lead to malicious code exploration. However, the report is important in a sense, because you cans examine the findings and look at major security coding flaws. This could be anywhere from common programming mistakes to more serious privilege escalation related flaws where an individual has the ability to pool liquidity for the project. If you have programming or cyber security experience it’s a lot easier to understand some of the language used within the report. Moreover, You can also examine on the report whether the project has rectified the issue raised in the audit. 

7. Reddit: just like the platform this post is on, Reddit can be a very useful tool to look for a projects Reddit page and whether it’s active, what the community is like and can also give updates about the project and discussion. 

8. YouTube interviews: it’s good to see interviews from the founders to see how they present themselves, as well some may also have dedicated channels that give updates about the project. Examples:

Interview and channel: Vitalik Buterin https://youtu.be/tPAh3cgj8gY

Charles Hoskinson https://youtu.be/yd1eg4QopV8

9. Etherscan (https://etherscan.io) or Bscscan (https://bscscan.com): I use this to look at the holders. To determine how it’s distributed and whether a certain wallet holds a large percentage of the supply which can be damaging to price action. 

10. ICOdrops: this is essentially a database (https://icodrops.com) and can allow you to do some DD on how a project was funded. 

11. Final question: Does this solve something in the crypto space? 

It’s hard to start up a business, let alone getting technology adoption to occur. Unfortunately many startups and projects do fail (https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/040915/how-many-startups-fail-and-why.asp) and it’s important to have a final check to make sure you’re happy about the longevity of that project. You want to be confident that it will still be around in the future and can survive the battlefield of a bear market. 

It’s long but I hope someone finds this post helpful."

TLDR at bottom

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

As markets continue their second month of dramatic sell offs, many newcomers are getting shaked out of the market by big whales wanting to add to their holdings at the $30k support level. I want to provide some analyses which prove we may be nearing a bottom, barring any sell pressure from US Stock Markets. Also, believers in blockchain technology need to remember that total conviction is necessary to be able to hold through multiple 70% drops. The guy who bought $1,000 at the top of 2013 would be enjoying 3000% gains currently, despite at least half a dozen falls of 50%. Remember these are volatile markets that have not quite matured yet. As governments provide regulatory insights for citizens and governments, volatility may remain high but subdue as more certainty hits the cryptocurrency markets. 

Despite an ugly chart, many on-chain indicators are pointing at further upside, as shown by William Clemente. For one, whale wallets have been getting busy, aggressively buying as we enter the 30-32k levels. As well, about 10% of all coins in existence have been traded between 31-35k, proving this should prove to be good long term support. 

Log chart shows that the 1.618 fibonacci level sits somewhere between 28-32k. This fib level has acted as mic-cycle support for the previous bull runs in 2013 and 2017. Both runs continued upside shortly after reaching these levels. A sustained dip below 28k may invalidate this trend, however. 

Global bitcoin adoption continues to grow exponentially, with new wallet addresses surging following the dip from $65k to 28k. Previous bull runs had resulted in significant drop offs in new users on the network after the big crash. Remember, BTC’s price is largely a network effect; the more addresses on the network, the higher the price rises with respect to time. Others that experienced network effects include Apple, Amazon, Ethereum, and Facebook. More users equals higher prices. I also expect AAVE to experience network effects as institutional money enters, but I could discuss more about this in a later post. Supply held by entities containing .1-1 BTC reaches new levels every day, proving an accumulation phase is occurring. Previous accumulation phases by wallets of this size occurred just before the 2017 bull run, and the 2021 bull run. *There is a chance we are just getting started* with the 2021 bull run. This is not financial advice, rather a bit of hopium for holders to remember.

CryptoCurrency,"Once upon a time in a village, a man appeared and announced to the villagers that he would buy monkeys for $10 each... The villagers, seeing that there were many monkeys around, went out to the forest and started catching them.

The man bought thousands at $10 and as supply started to diminish, the villagers stopped their effort. He further announced that he would now buy at $20. This renewed the efforts of the villagers and they started catching monkeys again.

Soon the supply diminished even further and people started going back to their farms. The offer increased to $25 each and the supply of monkeys became so little that it was an effort to even see a monkey, let alone catch it!

The man now announced that he would buy monkeys at $50! However, since he had to go to the city on some business, his assistant would now buy on behalf of him.

In the absence of the man, the assistant told the villagers; ""Look at all these monkeys in the big cage that the man has collected. I will sell them to you at $35 and when the man returns from the city, you can sell them to him for $50 each.""

The villagers rounded up with all their savings and bought all the monkeys.

CryptoCurrency,"How to DYOR - it's not as hard as you think and you'll be surprised what you can find or figure out about a coin. &amp;#x200B;

So research doesn't need to be amazingly in-depth. You don't need a degree in cryptography or need to understand the nuts and bolts of how blockchains work. You don't even need to read or understand the white paper. 

Firstly, if you're thinking about investing in a coin? - go to the coin's website. You can usually tell straight away if you're looking at a shitcoin. 

Stuff to look out for:

The project: What is the coin trying to achieve? what problems is it solving? Is it necessary? does it do anything unique that other coins aren't doing?

The team: Are they visible, do they have a background in cryptography, finance, mathematics, statistics, software engineering etc etc. Have they worked on good projects in the past? have they been involved in any scams before? A quick google of the names is all you need. 

The website: Is it professional and easy to understand? Do they try and blow you away with jargon without giving you the faintest idea of what they actually do? (I'm looking at you ICP). Is it full of spelling mistakes and obviously copy-pasted text and generic waffle?

&amp;#x200B;

So you like the project, like the idea, like the team, and the website looks legit. Now what?

Play devils advocate and look up news articles about the project. Try googling the coin with words like ""scam, ponzi, hacked, vulnerability etc"" see what negative things have been written about the project, try to collect as much criticism as you can. Has the team actually addressed any of these criticisms? Has the coin been updated to address any of its vulnerabilities or potential vulnerabilities? 

Does the coin do what it's supposed to do? Try to find some testimonials from people who've actually used it. For example, if your coin is a storage coin, find people who've actually tried using the service to store their files, what experiences have they had?

Buy a small amount of the coin, set up a wallet, see if it's as fast, cheap, painless as it claims to be. Try to use the service for whatever they say they are for. If it's an exchange token for example -&gt; how easy is the exchange to use? does it have low fees? does it work better than other exchanges that offer similar services? does the exchange offer anything that other exchanges don't?

Have similar projects offered/attempted the same thing and failed in the past? This is a big one, because time and time again you'll have a project fail making the exact same mistakes as other past projects. For example, algorithmic stablecoins, it's really, really, really hard to come up with an algorithm that automatically pegs a currency and is extremely easy to exploit if you get it wrong. Look at what happened with Titan/Iron.

AVOID YouTube/Twitter/Reddit shills and influencers. These people are often paid a lot of money to promote a product and will not offer objective analysis of the coin. 

In depth podcasts/interviews/AMAs with creators of coins can be very useful however, if only to get an idea of what the coin does and how it works from the people behind it. 

Lastly, is the coin being worked on, developed and upgraded? Look the coin up on Cryptomiso, see how many github contributors/commits it has next to it. 

Good luck"
CryptoCurrency,"I own no crypto! How to start🤔 prices are down! Apprehensive to transfer/ coins/ wallet???? Bitcoin came up in discussions at work morning meetings, never bought.  It was near $100, New and out of the norm.  I don't see it as I have missed the bus, but for someone with no crypto!  Where to start?
    I have opened a coinomi acct ($0 balance) and was wanting to fund it.  Linking a bank acct seems a bit scary!  Is this one of the better coin handlers?  
   Many mentions to coinbase?  Just looking for simple advice on funding a  new account, and with so many choices how to choose?  A simple easy to use and understand provider?  That won't halt trading or restrict selling!  Can I load coins on a jump drive not sure if this a cold wallet thing.
   The plan is to buy and hold, with extra $$$$ I have and don't need.  Restricting purchases in the top 10 coins.  The 250 the gov is sending me isn't needed would like to land this in crypto for a 14yo that someday might have a use for it(cost averaged buys).
    The only other thought is that some of my private sales can be in crypto to fund the accounts.   Thanks for any guidance, and if some shill says 💩robinhood💩 expect a block 👍"
CryptoCurrency,"Added crypto payments to online store I’m starting up a my first ever e-commerce business on Shopify. Unfortunately after I finished setting up my website I wasn’t aware that for CBD products I could not use regular Shopify payments. I was then told I have to use a 3rd party payment service. Not only do I need one 3rd party payment service but two since the one I signed up for (supposedly one of the best ones for CBD) does not integrate directly to Shopify, so one will accept payments while the other service uses their “top of the line tech” to integrate into my Shopify.


It is all very confusing ,especially when customer service is not very helpful. It gets worse not only will both of the 3rd party payment services be taking a fee for each transaction but so will Shopify even though I can’t use their Debit card Payment service because CBD products is a “High Risk” product which I don’t understand how when it is completely Legal in all 50 states. I actually am still waiting for the 3rd party service to answer me so I can be accepted to start making sales. It has been two weeks still 

Now to the good part, I was already planning on implementing crypto payments on my online store so I went ahead and did, I currently own some already as of January this year and been reading up on it since and love it. I used coinbase commerce to accept crypto payments as of yesterday on my website and it it was so easy!! In a matter of minutes I was able to finish setting up. It was even easier than I expected with no BS. In a perfect world everyone knows the basics of crypto and  knows how to purchase products using Crypto but that is not the case if it were this would be my only payment method! Maybe in the future.

If anyone was wondering I only have CBD topical salve for sale at the moment but looking to have CBD pens and drops in the near future. The topical works great for pain and discomfort! I actually got the idea after making some as a hobby and giving some to family members mainly for my grandfather who has arthritis and has helped him a lot with pain. Any recommendations to family or friends would be greatly appreciated. I haven’t had any sales yet but very excited to get my first sales in crypto.

CryptoCurrency,"My step sister almost blew my load In the beginning, she told me, ""There are some socks that  shouldn't be washed by mom."" Which, I actually sourced back to some book. But, it was something that stuck with me for the rest of my life. 

After a good while, she started not only washing my socks for me. . But, all of my clothes randomly. She was doing my laundry every single time I had a dirty garment. It wasn't until later on that I put two and two together. . 

One night, I woke up to find her in the laundry room.. Bent over, and on full display infront of the dryer. That's where things got.. interesting. It had occurred to me that not only did I forget my wallet in my trousers, but, my ledger was in both of her hands. I had made a grave, grave mistake. 

My recovery phase was inside of my wallet located on a laminated card. This unbelievable cretin was trying to suck my ledger dry of all my crypto! Thinking fast.. I swooped in before any damage could have possibly been done, and.. more or less, we ended up both stuck in the dryer.

Moral of the story is.. never trust your step sister with your laundry because she'll try to suck you out of your earnings!

Be safe, my friends. These are dark times. Not even family can be trusted."
CryptoCurrency,"Here's why I think right now is the perfect time to invest. I'd like to start with a disclaimer. This is completely based on my perspective, therefore don't take this as financial advice. 

&amp;#x200B;

As u may know we're currently in a 'big crypto dump' that unfortunately causes a lot of people to panick and consequently sell. These people are most likely new to the market or investing in general. As a first recommendation I'd suggest these people to look at the whole graph, instead of putting an interval of 1 minute. U should then realize pretty quickly that this 'big crypto dump' is completely common as the market tries to stabilize. 

&amp;#x200B;

Why do I think right now is the perfect time to invest? Well, gut feelings innit. No, just joking. Cryptocurrency in general became a very promising concept and will for sure play a big part in our lives in the upcoming future. If u compare this market to any market like gold, stock market or even real estate, u will see that cryptocurrency's market cap is not even close to theirs. What does this mean? Well, it means that this particular market is very refreshing and there's still a LOT of money to be made.

&amp;#x200B;

Another point I'd like to make is cryptocurrency's utility. If u have followed some of the altcoin's progress, like Doge, u should see where I'm getting at. Dogecoin started as a joke and over time it got serious up to a point where u can buy Teslas and shop on Amazon in the future. Even at this point u can do many transactions with this coin and therefore its utility increases. Aside from Dogecoin, the same principle goes with Bitcoin and Ethereum.

&amp;#x200B;

To get back to graphs and interval, try it. This has changed my perspective a lot when it comes to investments in this market. People have been bad mouthing and lost hope since back in 2013 and guess what, all the naysayers were wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

And last but not least, decentralization in 2024.

&amp;#x200B;

I'd like to hear ur perspective on this and perhaps I can also learn from u guys :3"
CryptoCurrency,"The APY comparison between POS coins doesn't matter. Disclosure: I own several POS projects that pay APY.

Most all of the serious crypto projects today are all inflationary (ETH may soon become an exception but not currently).  This inflation is nearly always deterministic and controlled (not the same as government fiat inflation).  

Inflation always transfers some of the value of the existing coins to the newly minted coins.  

POW (BTC) value transfer from hodlers to miners as all new coins are paid to block producers.

POS where coins must be staked (Cosmos, Tezos)  these coins only pay interest if the hodler takes extra steps to stake - in this case there is a value transfer from those who don't stake to those who do.  The higher interest rate is meaningful and affects the rate of value transfer.  The relative value of the interest payments are inversely proportional to the number of coins staked (at 100% participation no one is gaining value by staking - they are managing not to lose any value by staking so it is still an optimal decision).

POS where everyone is paid interest (ALGO).  Everyone is paid ~6%  no value transfer occurs in this scenario, while their may be a legitimate reason to do it (in ALGOs case they are trying to distribute the circulating coins fairly) the 6% you are paid results in a slight decrease in the value of each coin directly offset by the value of new coins received."

Will we see massive buying pressure push the price straight back up from institutions and retail getting in before the next run up?

This sub is the house of moons and it seems that we cannot debate about it, i got my post closed by the admin (with 600k moons) citing that this is no news so it should be closed, were mostly half of the sub is no-news related posts. I asked the mod and he told me that there are no updates and no news about moons, so nothing should be said...

CryptoCurrency,"The Importance of Learning About Crypto from a Respectable Source: How a Friend of Mine Invested in a Scam-Coin  My friend and I both started buying cryptos after the bullrun in May, although at the time I didn't know he joined this world too. He is probably the prime example of what happens when you learn about cryptos on [r/CryptoMoonShots](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoonShots/) : he had no prior experience in cryptos and was somehow convinced to invest in a token on the Binance Smart Chain (yeah I know...); he also joined the Telegram group associated with the coin and became part of their ''army'' (he even changed his pfp to the logo of the coin).

He told me about his investment when we met a few weeks later, he tried to convince me to invest in it too but at the time I was still a newbie and I was afraid of buying anything that wasn't a very well established coin, I also don't trust anyone when my money is on the line. Even tho I was a newbie a could smell bullshit from a mile away and I told him that I didn't think this token was a legit project. He ignored me.

A couple of days later I tried again: I messaged him and told him that the coin was definitly a scam; I told him how when researching this coin all I could find was only a bunch of posts on [r/CryptoMoonShots](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoonShots/) and in some comments even the members of the sub were calling it a scam. I did also take a look at their website and the whitepaper is literally a pdf with 12 basic slides. He was a bit worried but still didn't sell.

Literally the next day he texted me back showing me that the price of the coin increased by 1000%, I told him to sell, he ignored me again because the members of the telegram group told him that the value was going to increase further; literally 30 minutes later the price was back to what it was before the pump. Anyone would have understood that if the price pumps and dumps so quickly it means that the price is heavily manipulated; he instead trusted even more the token and I ended up looking like an asshole. To this day he still holds the coin. He's definitly going to get fucked once the rugpull takes place.

I'm going to wrap this up because I don't wanna type a novel. The moral of the story is that the source from which someone learns about cryptocurrencies is probably the most important and crucial step for new investors. If someone you know is dipping their toes in the crypto world, it is extremly important that they are given some sort of guidance, too many people still think that crypto is a get-rich-quick scheme and fall prey of greed and scam-coins. I know that many on this sub say that the easiest thing to do is just not to talk with them about crypto because you could ruin a friendship but in my humble opinion, if your friend ends up hating you because of a shitcoin, he wasn't a real friend. The experience of the scam will also probably make them abbandon the crypto world forever and they will end up missing real opportunities.

Btw if you're wondering, he's still a good friend; sometimes he still tells me to invest in the coin and I still tell him that I don't trust it."

CryptoCurrency,"Movement to Make Moons More Serious: Thread One: Exit Strategy Hello, I'm /u/industriousness, and welcome to my first in a series of threads aimed at the average /r/CryptoCurrency user with the intention of changing their perception in relation to Reddit Moons and their potential.

By now we are all aware of the fact that posting in different ways, and receiving upvotes, can result in a user on this subreddit being awarded moons on a monthly basis. These monthly awards are subject to votes that refine the distribution process each month, and in so doing help to legitimise Reddit Moons as a cryptocurrency by lowering the supply of Moons produced each month. 

Reddit Moons are seen as a curio; a strange oddity of this subreddit. The fact that arguably the largest crypto community on the internet has its own cryptocurrency is not something that, to my knowledge, people have given a lot of deference or thought to, apart from the usually vague posts about ""waiting until Moons hit the mainnet"" (which is, of course, an extremely acceptable and sensible position to take). 

Perhaps part of the reason for this is 1) a lack of use cases for Reddit Moons, 2) infrequent communication to the users of this subreddit as to what the end ambition of Reddit Moons is supposed to be, 3) Reddit Moons not as of yet being available on ""mainnet"" exchanges such as Coinbase or Kraken and 4) a scepticism of the price of Reddit Moons themselves. These are all perfectly reservations to have in terms of Reddit Moons.

I think there needs to be a new conversation about Reddit Moons, like when Gallileo introduced to the concept of Copernican Heliocentricism. I think we need to start talking not just about price predictions (because believe you me, the price of Reddit Moons is destined to increase from here on out) but exit strategies. And have the price at which you will exit step in stone, be it fifty cent, a dollar, ten dollars or more. Figure out what you will do with your Reddit Moons when you cash out."

CryptoCurrency,"Crypto will need to find a soluction to this problem if it is going to get mainstream adoption. &amp;#x200B;

The problem is the safety of your funds.

If I have $100k in cash in the bank or stocks I feel 100% safe that I'm never going to lose that money.

If somehow my bank account is compromised/hacked, I ring up the bank and within a couple of days the money is back in my account. This has happened to many people I know. In fact the bank has even refunded me when I've bought airline tickets and the airline went bankrupt. I'm secure in the knowledge that my money is safe.

Stocks, even more so - they are actually in my name - so I don't have any worry they'll be stolen.

Crypto exchanges and wallets on the other hand - you're on your own. No crypto exchange is going to refund you if your account is compromised and your funds are stolen. Then there is the risk of the exchange itself getting hacked or going insolvent. 

So then you have to go the route of a cold wallet. But then you're left with the dilemma of where to store the seed phrase. Leaving it at home somewhere risks it getting destroyed or stolen, the equivelent to having $100k lying around. Putting it in ledger or a password protected file with a backup somewhere is good, but if you forget the password you're screwed, and again you could have it stolen or hacked, again with the bank you lose the password it's no big deal - just prove your ID to the bank and you have access to your funds again. 

So you're left with having to come up with a convoluted solution to protect your funds - have half the seed phrase at a safe deposit box at the bank, half at another bank, have a backup on a disused laptop somewhere that isnt connected to the internet etc etc..

The fact that people have so much anxiety transferring money means we're definitely not there yet. So the million dollar question is -&gt; how do we maintain the benefits of crypto (decentralisation, complete control of funds), without the risk and anxiety of losing everything?"

The US (and our ancient politicians) has it in their minds for some reason that the US should be the world leader in every possible aspect.

If anything comes along to threaten those things, they will do everything they can to weaken and destroy it before it does (just look at their response to China's rising power).

Misinformation and scams.

And that’s for one simple reason, those shitcoins preached to the average chap that isn’t very knowledgeable on crypto may take their word as gospel, and buy hundreds worth thinking it can only go up, but instead it was a scam.

Those 2 reasons are why I’m happy for a bear market, no need to keep checking your coins wondering if they crashed or mooned while you were sleeping, or endlessly waiting for doge to hit $1 as Elon claims, you can just keep buying when you want and wait for that skyrocket in a couple years time"
CryptoCurrency,"DeFi is rocket fuel for NFTs NFTs offer a high level of interoperability and act as representations of non-traditional assets. 

This means that NFTs can be used in many areas. This includes video games, digital identity, licensing, certificates, or fine arts. These tokens can and even allow for fractional ownership of objects.

This is precisely where DeFi comes into play.

In all of the fields they are applied to, NFTs serve to represent some sort of value. The administration of these values can be done completely in the blockchain via smart contracts. This perfectly fits the definition of a DeFi project: a financial tool operating along the blockchain.

**Present DeFi NFT offerings:**

 Existing developments in this area are already diverse.

For example, there are DeFi projects that describe themselves as a decentralized exchange for NFTs. One of the best known in this area is [**Drops**](https://drops.co). It is a new protocol that’s designed to leverage NFTs as collateral for loans. Designed with the future of financial NFTs in mind, Drops aims to optimize the utility of NFT assets to minimize their opportunity cost and maximize the returns of holding them. 

Another example of the combination of NFTs and DeFi is [**Aavegotchi**](https://aavegotchi.com/), which is a completely decentralized collection game.

Furthermore, [**Tinlake**](https://tinlake.centrifuge.io/) combines NFTs and Defi by offering a service that forms a bridge between real-world assets and DeFi. Its goal is to access bankless liquidity.

[**NFTfi**](https://nftfi.com/) is an additional player that stands out in this field. They offer a platform on which owners can lend their NFTs to other users.

These companies are already innovative and diverse. But, these are just a few of the many potential applications of these technologies. As described, the possibilities for combining DeFi and NFTs are far from exhausted.

An exciting future endeavor would be using DeFi and NFTs in in-game worlds or even for the administration of real assets such as land and houses.

**Summary:**

NFTs describe unique cryptographic tokens which are considered valuable because of their security and scarcity. In combination with decentralized financial products, unique financial services can be created using these tokens.

My friend always asked me why I was saving my money and being “cheap”, and I showed him ETH. He laughed in my face and told me I was crazy. I proceeded to buy for the next 2 years.

Now it’s July 2020, the bull run is heating up and I tell my friend to buy in. He laughs at me again, and told me that I was tripping and would lose my money. 

At the peak, my life was changed financially. He came up to me and asked me why the hell I didn’t tell him about it… he yelled at me, called me names, and was outright jealous. He said I was lucky and I told him I wasn’t lucky, just patient. He has always avoided me ever since.

If this most recent cycle behaves anything like the ones from 2013 and 2017, then we still have a ways to go before Bitcoin (which still dictates the entire market, yes, including Ethereum) hits its new baseline. Prices will have plummeted and trading volume will be way down. Your friends will no longer be asking you to help them create a Coinbase/Binance account. The altcoin subreddits will be basically dead. Everything will be quiet, and the hype will be gone. 

***This is the time to be buying Bitcoin, Ethereum, or whatever other coin of choice.***

Don't be like me in 2019. Don't be like the rest of the casuals that will only start buying in again in late 2023 when Bitcoin has already shot to new all time highs and passed $100,000 and the hype train has already made it halfway down the track. Buy *before* the hype train leaves the station.

For those that aren't deeply involved in crypto on a daily basis, I suggest taking 5 minutes right now and creating an alarm/reminder for yourself for a year from now. That way, you won't have to worry about anything, and you won't miss your chance to get in before the next bull run begins.

As a crypto HODLer with very little cash left to buy the dip, personally I'd really like to see this crab market end and crypto to head on a course straight for the moon.  Realistically I know that anybody who tells you that they know exactly what the crypto market will do is definitely lying and anything could happen at any time for literally no reason in particular.  All models are wrong, but some are more useful than others.  In this post I'll be using some technical analysis, on chain metrics, and upcoming events to make speculation about what I think the market is more likely to do (go up) and some info about the potential for downside.  Before I get started on this, here's a TLDR for those who CBA to read walls of text.

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR:** Crypto market as a whole is still largely a slave to bitcoin price action.  Bitcoin is forming a descending wedge pattern on low volume (reversal signal) and network hash rate is closely modeling the shape of the late 2018-&gt;mid 2019 bull action.  On chain metrics also indicate that those with large amounts of bitcoin are largely accumulating at current prices.  Ethereum London Hard Fork maybe also act as a catalyst for price increase.  On the flip side, the 2021 cycle and crash in may has exhibited several of the same indicators we have seen post other cycle tops, and we could realistically have finished this bull run and be in the long term bear market.  In addition, several impending market crash indicators for the US stock market are appearing and a stock market crash may lead to a crypto market crash similar to March 2020.  Smooth brain say price either go up, down, or sideways.

&amp;#x200B;

**1. Bitcoin as the market driver**

Since the inception of cryptocurrency, bitcoin has been the dominator of market sentiment.  Long term trends of nearly every cryptocurrency have followed the same trend and cyclical price action based on bitcoin's halvening events.  Below are graphs of the total market cap of the entire crypto market and bitcoin's price for the past year.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/godlr1mio8c71.png?width=800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=37a451671e1edb2300f46d8dea93e54171ae7482

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6hctljzzo8c71.png?width=804&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bbf8b160238adda268448efba6f5b1c4a212bba8

Pretty easy to spot that these graphs are strikingly similar and come to the conclusion that the crypto market still is largely just following whatever bitcoin does.  Personally I think within the next decade we will see other projects establish themselves well enough to become decoupled from bitcoin but for the time being analyzing bitcoin remains a solid method of analyzing what the entire market as a whole will do so for the rest of this post I will stick mostly to what's going on with bitcoin under the assumption that the rest of the market will generally follow bitcoin's trends.

&amp;#x200B;

**2. Bitcoin price TA, the falling wedge pattern**

First I'll start by discussing what a falling wedge pattern is, how it forms, and what it means.  A falling wedge pattern occurs when you have contracting price ranges in an overall downward trend.  Essentially you see lower highs and lower lows and the range that the price is staying inside of is getting smaller and smaller.  Another indication of the wedge pattern forming is that volume is also decreasing.

A falling wedge pattern occurring after the general trend has been upward (definitely was the case for bitcoin prior to this correction) is a sign of trend reversal, in this case a correction ending and resuming a bull run.  The more the price contracts during this wedge pattern, the less powerful the downtrend becomes.  Let's zoom in on this.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/anja4op4t8c71.png?width=174&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=70d316936b2adc5982ad40f97bfec920ef62d852

Looking at bitcoin's recent price action, we can see the formation of the falling wedge and the accompanied drop in volume.  My conjecture is that this is a pattern indicating a reversal in the trend and that we see the bull market resume after an extended correction (or short term bear market, whichever works).

Keep in mind, technical analysis is mostly bullshit, especially where crypto is concerned.  There are significant amounts of traders that do trade based on technical indicators though so there is some validity to technical analysis but it is certainly far from a guarantee that what it is indicating will actually happen. 

&amp;#x200B;

**3. Bitcoin network hash rate**

Bitcoin's hash rate is a measure of how much computing power is being applied to the network by miners.  This provides network operation and security with increasing levels as more computing power is applied to the network.  Bitcoin's price does not always follow hash rate, but it can give us an idea of how much interest there is in mining bitcoin and is a good valuation as far as bitcoins ""worth"" in terms of real value applied to the network in the form of computing power which costs money from electricity and equipment.  Here's a graph of hash rate for the past 3 years.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/g2cxbrh6v8c71.png?width=720&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9dfb5022798e622416d67111f0d965fd00a22d2f

Keep in mind that these hash rate values are not exact, but calculated based on how long blocks are taking to solve at current difficulty levels and then average over a short time period to create a trendline.

There are a few key things to take away from this graph.  First off, a drop in the bitcoin price has not always been accompanied by a drop in hash rate.  This point is more obvious when you look at hash rate during the end of the 2017 bull run (not shown here) where hash rate keeps going up even through the crash.  In more recent years however, we have seen a general trend where the network hash rate drops and increases with the bitcoin price.  Looking at the end of the graph it's pretty easy to spot where the middle of May 2021 is and when the Chinese miners had to shut down their operations.

What this caused was the largest difficulty drop on record (and another further difficulty drop the last adjustment).  This means that mining profitability has now skyrocketed relative to where it was in May prior to the crash.  Since then more and more operations (likely in China mostly) have had to shut down and as the network hash rate plummeted, prior to the difficulty adjustment, many miners probably shut down their equipment temporarily while mining was relatively difficult and block times were long.  Let's zoom in to what's currently happening though.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/w1r8ovabx8c71.png?width=720&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c36f337b8a62a9ab8aaa09e9dd05abd59de14c4e

Hash rate bottoms out at the beginning of July, where we had the massive drop in difficulty, and then BAM, hash rate immediately starts to climb back up.  Mining is now profitable again and we see hash rate has been on an uptrend since that huge adjustment.  Likely this is just the 1st wave, a lot of those china based mining operations are looking to move elsewhere and they are going to want to get back online while mining difficulty is still much lower than it was previously.  An increase in hash rate means a more powerful and secure network, and a better valuation for bitcoin.

&amp;#x200B;

**4. Bitcoin accumulation by the whales**

For the sake of brevity and not just copy/pasting, I'm going to link this article which has a pretty solid analysis on the overall trend of various size wallets.

[https://ecoinometrics.substack.com/p/ecoinometrics-on-chain-trends](https://ecoinometrics.substack.com/p/ecoinometrics-on-chain-trends)

The TLDR of this analysis is that wallet addressed that would constitute being whales, largely sold off as bitcoin reach trading high between March-May and have now begun to accumulate again with the price in the low 30k range.  

Typically speaking we think of whales as either institutional investors or individuals with large amounts of wealth.  Nobody in that group is particularly fond of losing money and generally have high amounts of market knowledge or at a minimum have their money being managed by those who do.  With whales accumulating, and events happening like Bank of America offering bitcoin investing to ""select groups"", it's hard to ignore that big money thinks bitcoin has bottomed out and is putting their money behind that hypothesis. 

**5. Ethereum London Hard Fork**

Most of this post has been about bitcoin but Ethereum has definitely become significant enough to warrant it potentially starting to affect the market and dethrone bitcoin as the sole driver.  At time of writing Ethereum is worth 17.1% of the entire crypto market cap (compared to bitcoin's 46.4%).  Ethereum has some exciting news on the horizon so let's take a look.

There are two main features coming in EIP-1559.  The first being a change to how Ethereum gas fees are calculated.  This change should improve the overall user experience of dealing with gas fees and hopefully also make gas fees more consistent in cost.  The second is a gas fee burn mechanic.  Essentially there will be a ""base fee"" and a ""tip"" portion of Ethereum gas fees in transactions.  The ""base fee"" will be burned and the miners will get the ""tip"" portion.  Paying the extra ""tip"" portion can essentially allow someone to pay extra fee in order to make processing the transaction more of a priority for the network.

The token burn mechanic is the one that has the most speculation as far as impact to Ethereum's price goes.  Basing it off the general supply and demand, burning the gas fee instead of giving it to miners would theoretically cause a drop in the supply.  For a given demand level this would then cause an increase in price.  This is obviously not the sole driver of the price of any asset so just like any other single thing, it could cause nothing to happen.

&amp;#x200B;

**6. The potential for downside**

While I would love to live in the dream of ""stocks only go up"" the reality is nobody knows exactly what will happen other than that we will either see it go up, go down, or go sideways.  Let's take a look at what could cause it to go down.

The first theory, is that we have finished the 2021 bull cycle and have entered the typical long term bear market following price run-ups in the halvening cycle.  There are some standard indicators we have seen that have matched up with previous cycle tops.  Bitcoin's price action has definitely trended like a cycle end since the middle of may.  \~50% crash over a few days, followed by a dead cat bounce, then a slow decline.  In addition, the ATH so far in 2021 occurred almost exactly at the same time in the cycle (days post halvening) that the 2013 peak happened.  So timeline wise there is also precedent for the run to have come to an end.  While a double peak is also not unprecedented as the same thing happened in 2013 run, we should definitely be prepared for the 2021 bull run to have reached it's end.

The second theory, is an impending US stock market crash.  Looking back to the bitcoin chart, we see a large price drop occurring in March 2020, exactly lining up with the COVID induced stock market crash.  One of the downsides to more widespread adoption and institutional investors is that when shit hits the fan for the stock market it will also hit the fan for the crypto market.  Right now there are inflation fears, craziness going on with the housing market, insanely high reverse rehypothecation action, and several other indicators that have not been seen since the 2007-2008 time period just before the 2008 stock market crash.  Even if it does happen, when it happens is anybody's guess, but a stock market crash is at least on the table and if it does happen its a pretty solid bet that the crypto market will crash too.

&amp;#x200B;

**Conclusion**

There are a lot of posts out there saying things like ""price will go to 250k!"", ""the bull run is not over"", ""we are definitely in a bear market"", ""crypto will crash further"", you guys get the gist.  In reality, there are several things working both for and against the crypto market and either one could take the reigns at any time.  The only proven strategy in the long term is to HODL for the big green candles.  Don't trade based on emotion or what anybody (including me) tells you what they think is going to happen.  The only thing anybody knows for certain is that nobody knows shit about fuck."

Tellor utilizes crypto-economic incentive mechanisms, rewarding honest data submissions by miners and punishing bad actors, through the issuance of Tellor’s token, Tributes (TRB) and a dispute mechanism. 1M current supply, low market cap, ATH is 142$ and it’s on sale now!"

After spending years researching this market, I have gained so much knowledge and insight in the industry and learned from others, that it is hard for me to look anywhere else for investment opportunities in my 20s with this degree of confidence. I have concluded this is the hill I die on. 10k of my salary goes to retirement funds 5k to PMs and every single penny outside of that is dedicated to crypto currencies for the years to come. I have plans to live with my family the next 2-3 years until I’m atleast around 25 so lots of liquidity to focus on crypto and potentially change my life or go to zero.

CryptoCurrency,"Here's your daily dose of Hopium - We may be following the 2013 Bull Run  Here’s something interesting I found in the 2013 bull run for Bitcoin that might make you feel a little better. Obviously not financial advice and who knows what will happen but you still might want to check this out. I am not a TA guy at all but I did want to go back and look at the price action from 2013 since people talk about it so much and here’s what I found.

January 2013 Btc is around $13

April 2013 Btc is around $160

July 2013 Btc is approx. $90

October 2013 Btc is approx. $120

December 2013 Btc is around $1200

Just like in 2013, this year we peaked in april then had a big dip and contonue to crab. Not saying that were following this trend exactly but it does feel kind of similar. I mean corrections are normal through out Btc’s history. Nothing fundamental has changed for the worse imo which is why I continue to hold. 

With that being said, I do have money on the sideline and am waiting to buy the dip on Bitcoin and some other alts. Won't pull the trigger unless we see btc sub 30k, ideally below 28.  
And if youre stressed, re access why youre in Bitcoin or any other crypto. Do you really understand the project? When it goes down are you scared because you think you might lose money, or are you excited because you see an opportunity to buy an asset you love at a severely undervalued price. Most importantly, dont invest money you cant afford to lose. People say this all the time but then invest anyway. Assume every investment is a loss right away. there's nothing wrong with taking profits or hodling.

In my opinion thats the difference between the people that lose and win in any market. When dips come, the people that panic sell are the ones that have no idea why they bought in the first place and are the same people that will buy when the price doubles again.  
I wish all of you luck and if im wrong im willing to live with that. Just as bullish as I've ever been :)

Wouldnt mind a 10x in november either :D (just like 2013)"

CryptoCurrency,"Ethereum: Heir to the crown of Bitcoin As cryptocurrency grows as a subset of asset, the way the top 10 will look is always going to be changing. Not one of us can know for a fact what may happen in the next week, month, year, or decade. 

With that said let's speculate wildly. 

Ethereum is the heir apparent in my eyes to the kingdom that BTC built; with a substantial use case, an ecosystem all its own, tons of development and potentially trillions of dollars moving through it. 

As Defi becomes a staple of the crypto world, Eth will continue to grow and grow, supposed ""killers"" will come and go or find their own niche and stick around (ADA, DOT, SOL, etc) but none of them are in my eyes going to be able to slay eth. 

We can be our own bank, we can be our own lender, we can make our own generational wealth through crypto, and Ethereum is a key to open many of those doors. 

Nobody would be sleeping on Ethereum at these prices, it's a god send. I'll be scooping up as many as I can. 

This is not to say that other projects won't be worth buying of course, there's room for all of us in this incarnation, we're all cosmic love. All crypto should be allowed their chance to thrive.

CryptoCurrency,"New to Crypto? Acronyms you Should Know 1. Hold On for Dear Life (HODL)

What started as a typo has become a rallying cry for crypto investors who don't sell their assets. For example, I'm a HODLer: I don't intend to sell my cryptocurrency for the next five or 10 years. Given the extreme volatility of crypto investments, HODLing is a good way to avoid panic-selling and focus on the long term.

2. Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt (FUD)

It's hardly surprising that what some dub the wild west of investing has its own acronym for the whirlwind of nervousness and apprehension that can come with it. The fact is, this is such a new industry that we can't be sure how it will pan out. This fuels constant rumors that the end is nigh -- or that Bitcoin (BTC) is about to rebound to its all-time highs.

You'll also see accusations that people are ""spreading FUD."" The connotation here is that they are deliberately sharing false or misleading information to influence a coin's price.

3. Fear Of Missing Out (FOMO)

That anxiety you feel when a coin on your watchlist suddenly jumps in price and you wonder if you should buy it so you don't miss out on any further gains? It has a name: FOMO. A lot of people who hadn't bought crypto had a severe case of FOMO back in March when prices seemed to go nowhere but up.

FOMO was officially added to the Oxford dictionary in 2013 and applies outside the crypto world, too.

4. Going to the moon

Crypto investors hope their coins might go to the moon. It's a stratospheric growth that sends the coin's price off the charts -- to the moon. Also known as mooning, you'll often find the term in memes and Reddit forums.

5. Diamond hands or paper hands

Serious HODLers have diamond hands -- referring to a diamond's ability to withstand enormous pressure. People with diamond hands do not sell, no matter what. In contrast, if someone has paper hands, they sell at the first sign of trouble.

On forums, having paper hands is usually used as an insult. But the truth is that sometimes it does make sense to sell a bad investment, even if you've lost money. It all depends on your investment strategy and personal situation.

6. Whales

Cryptocurrency whales own enough of the currency to have an outsized influence on the price. Back in 2017, about 1,000 people owned 40% of all the Bitcoin in circulation. Many of these Bitcoin whales bought into crypto early. Famous whales include the Winklevoss twins, ​​Tim Draper, and Michael Saylor."

CryptoCurrency,"Why Jackson Palmer (Doge creator) is wrong about crypto. By now im sure we’ve all seen the thread by the now infamous dogecoin co creator calling cryptocurrency “inherently right-wing, hyper-capitalistic technology” , a quote i believe is completely false and shortsighted.

Palmer is very obviously conflating the current situation of crypto with its original purpose and potential.

The whole thread repeatedly states that crypto is a tool for the rich and extracts money from the poorer, yet fails to explain at all how this is an inherent feature as he calls it. 

Almost every valuable asset IN THE WORLD is used for tax evasion and money laundering, and jackson is surprised when an ecosystem with a market cap of over a trillion us dollars is exploited by the rich? 

Not to mention the obvious bias Palmer has when speaking on the subject. If you created a project and sold all your stake in it for a few thousand you would obviously cringe at the millions you missed out on and hope it might lose its value so you can feel like you made the right decision to sell. 

Honestly i just feel like its really irresponsible to make such serious claims and then provide almost no legitimate nuance on why you came to that conclusion."

Today for whatever reason i thought I will take a look at the UNI Token.

So I went to Uniswap and followed the Token address

Then I took a closer look at the holders. The 5 biggest ones are Uni pools, the 6th address though belongs to a person.

You can see that this mysterious whale holds a bunch Uni and thats pretty much it only a bit (still a bunch) ether for gas I assume.

If you know Etherscan you know that there is a comment section, and I saw the green blop popping up that someone postet a comment on this address. I couldn't believe what I found there just take a look.

* **living the NFT-hype:** [**NBA TOPSHOT**](https://nbatopshot.com/) **(not free, but low risk)**  

   * investment (78,56 $) - sales + account value (168.7 $) = **90,14 $ total earnings**

CryptoCurrency,"Due to 0% or even Negative Interest Rates, using Staking/DeFi Lending as a Savings Account is a no-brainer. Make Your Money Work For You. Interest rates have been kept at near 0%. This isn't even nearly enough to beat inflation, which means you’re losing purchasing power, LOSING money every year by keeping it in a savings account. Hell, some places in the EU have NEGATIVE interest rates, which means you're literally paying a bank to keep your money. It has become literally impossible to simply save your money in traditional finance without losing purchasing power. This is why DeFi and Staking are game changers.

This is the new savings account in 2021. You can stake or provide collateral on DeFi lending platforms and earn a pretty handsome yield. I have seen yields anywhere from 5% to 11%. **Even if you don’t want to risk holding a volatile crypto, staking USDC/DAI or other stablecoins for a 6-10% yield is a no-brainer and a much better deal than any bank will give you.**"

Did not invest more than I'm afraid to lose, and set dates to buy more once a month as a type of savings with a chance to boom.

As I was talking about it with my best friend I said that I think it is great to be investing in crypto and that I believe there is a future for cryptocurrencies my friend FOMOd hard.  I did not know at the time, and I told him that I invested maybe 1/7 of my monthly salary and that I think that crypto is still pretty much gamble, my friend went and got a loan and bought BTC, ETH and DOGE as his wife likes dogs ( I know, his reasoning is astounding). 

I own ADA, ALGO and VET primarily and am looking to enter BTC and ETH after we sell our old car ( car is worth maybe 800$) so still it wont be great positions and I told my friend that so I can't fathom doge.

He got a loan with a big interest as those are high for a loan without purpose, don't know what those are called overseas (there is a loan to buy a car or a house that have low interests rates), bought a lot of crypto and is now massively in the red, I feel responsible for even mentioning crypto like a utter newb.

CryptoCurrency,"The Predatory Practice That Is Targeted Advertising Hey all. Welcome to some OC weird shit with Francis.

So recently I have been using Brave browser as a way to liberate myself from the horrifically normalized predatory practice that is targeted advertising. It has been about three months and I would like to share some interesting metrics concerning the violation of privacy that nearly every single person who regularly browses the internet is constantly and unwittingly subjected to.

During my brief time using Brave Browser (3 months) I have avoided nearly 54 THOUSAND ads and trackers, saved 2 GB of data, and last but not certainly not least saved about a whole hour of my life (I will not mention BAT rewards here cause let’s face it folks, they don’t amount to jack shit). 

Upon reviewing these statistics I was absolutely astonished. I know that we are all being watched, all of our information is frequently stolen, and, to top it all off, that same info is forcefully shoved back down our own throats with no regard as to how any of us may or may not feel about this process. BUT I HAD NO IDEA TO WHAT MAGNITUDE.

Now I know what you are thinking: “but Francis how will I know what to buy if the corporate overlords don’t make all my choices for me???? I am but a wee babe!!!” And to that I say: “I know baby, but sit back, let these numbers run and then holler at me”

If you assume that I have average browsing habits (which I do) and that only half of the World Population regularly browses the Internet, the numbers are pretty damn scary. So scary in fact that I had to turn my phone sideways to even be able to do the math.

With these parameters in mind, over the last three months Internet users have been subject to approximately 216,000,000,000,000 trackers/ads.

Close to 8 billion gigabytes of data is required to send and receive all this information. Guess who is paying for all of this shit? (If your guess isn’t “me” then you are wrong)

Most worrisome is the fact that 8 billion hours of people’s lives are required to load, view, and hate these ads. 

This is essentially a quarterly report, meaning that over a year these numbers will be about 4x the ones I have listed. Think about how long this has been going on for. Think about exactly how many resources have been fruitlessly wasted in the name of conning a person by stealing their private info and feeding it back to them. It’s fucking literally insane.

I know that these numbers are not set in stone, but this is a thought exercise to help you get a ballpark idea of just how predatory and wasteful this advertising “industry” actually is. We’ve only spoken about the internet. Do you watch tv? Listen to the radio? Go to the movies? Watch dvds? 

It’s gonna get to a point where a meaningful percentage of our lives is spent watching ads we do not want to see for things that we do not need and we will pay our internet provider for this obstruction and we will pay with time off of our lives clock.

Also, another rabbit hole I won’t go down: This unnecessary expenditure of energy is HORRIBLE for the environment. But you will not ever hear about that because you are being treated as a product and they are making bank hand over fist selling you to yourself. 

Thanks for your time, Peace."

CryptoCurrency,"Crypto has really helped my spending/saving habits. While I believe Crypto itself will help improve my financial wellbeing, I am also incredibly thankful for the other financial lessons Crypto has taught me.   I am curious if anyone else has had this same experience. 

So I take the Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA) strategy when it comes to crypto. I buy the same coins, with the same amount of money each and every week, regardless of price. When I first adopted this approach I had determined an amount of money that I could reasonably invest each week, without being financially compromised if it all went to zero. That then led me down the road of looking for ways to eliminate ferocious expenses I was making in my day to day life. Things like cutting out recurring subscription services that I had forgotten about. I pretty much exclusively cut out DoorDash and food delivery services and started cooking at home (now it is a fun hobby). I trimmed everywhere I reasonably could and added it to my DCA amount.  The best thing - I don't even miss these things because I had little awareness of where I was spending all of my money. 

Now I know where exactly every dollar I earn is going. And I primarily credit Crypto for that. It gave me a goal which drove me to really dig into my spending habits and create a budget. Even if everything goes to zero tomorrow, I will still be thankful for crypto for helping me get on top of my finances."

My reasoning: Struggled to cope watching my investments in a highly volatile market. Exploring free income streams made me feel a lot better about it.   
I had several requirements: a) low or reasonable initial financial investment, b) casual time investment over time 

# These are my results: 

* **3 synergetic dApps on WAX blockchain**
   * investment: 5 $ / total earnings  791 WAX = ***91,83*** **$ \* total earnings** (current value) 
   * time invest: medium 
   * entry barrier (initial time invest): high  

* [https://alienworlds.io/](https://alienworlds.io/)
   * a mining browser-game to earn Trilium (TLM). Chance of mining valuable NFT's
* [https://wax.kolobok.io/](https://wax.kolobok.io/)
   * breeding Koloboks, sending them on adventure. Rewards are NFT's and KBUCKS, which can be traded for WAX 
* [https://rplanet.io/stake](https://rplanet.io/stake)
   * the place to stake your NFT's from Alienworlds and Koloboks. As reward you receive AETHER hourly as passive income, which can be traded for WAX  

* [**Phoneum mobile games**](https://phoneum.io/) (Crypto Cards, Crypto Planet, Crypto Treasures, Green Karma)
   * investment: 0 $ / total earnings:  57713 PHT= ***6,94*** **$ total earnings**
   *  Phoneum (PHT) is a mobile-only cryptocurrency, financed by advertisement and in-game transactions. You basically play minigames or dig 24h for a bigger rewards but have to suffer ads. 
   * time invest: low
   * entry barrier (initial time invest): won't get lower

&amp;#x200B;

* **living the NFT-hype:** [**NBA TOPSHOT**](https://nbatopshot.com/) **(not free, but low risk)**
   * investment (78,56 $) - sales + account value (168.7 $) = **90,14 $ total earnings**
   * time invest: extremely low
   * entry barrier (initial time invest): lowish
   * card-collecting marketplace
   * you buy limited card packs with USD and hope for valuable drops, which can be sold on marketplaces 
   * building a collection increases your collectors score, which makes you eligible for rarer pdrops

&amp;#x200B;

\*Keep in mind, that my earning reflect the current value. If you sold your Wax regularly over time, earnings would be a lot higher due to current downfall.   
What do you think about my methods? Feel free to ask any questions."
CryptoCurrency,"Different ways to make money off crypto Hey, so I'm relatively new to the crypto community and I want to find out about new ways to make money off crypto. I have tried ""investing"" in some shitcoins just to see what it's all about but I have noticed that more and more scams are appearing, it's becoming more time consuming to find good coins and from my experience it's pretty much gambling. :D 
All I have is BNB in my metamask account and I'm wondering if there are any safer, more reliable new ways to make little money off crypto."

CryptoCurrency,"I am 6 months old in crypto. Thanks to the bear run, I finally have money to buy 1 ETH. Should I? Some context. I am just 6 months old in Crypto sphere. With my limited experience and knowledge I have made some systematic monthly investments in BTC, ETH, DOT, MATIC and  ADA. Projects that I thought were solid. 

I have some fiat saved which had been sitting idle in a savings bank account since last 3 years. Technicaly an extreme extreme emergency fund. (Don't worry, have some other emergency resorces available as well for next 6 months.)  ETH is finally within reach. Should I get one? I am not chasing the moon, just want healthy returns and my money to beat inflation comfortbly.

My thought process is to invest and forget for the long run. Is there something that I should know or you guys would want to suggest?

Thank you!"
CryptoCurrency,"To say BTC will be no. #1 forever is naive and short-sighted  I wanted to talk about BTC and the possibility of it falling out of the no. 1 spot within the next 3-5 years. I am not saying BTC is going to fail. I am not saying BTC is going to zero. In fact, I believe by the time a project flips BTC, BTC will be well above $500k.

A lot of people got into crypto in the last 6 months and consider themselves ""late to the party"" but this is in fact not the truth. The crypto markets as a whole are roughly 1 decade old(I know, BTC genesis was 2009) but exchanges didn't come to fruition until &gt;2010).

For reference, the stock market is between 150-200 years old. You don't have to go back 25-50 years to see how much the top market cap companies have changed. Simply look 10 years ago. My point being the crypto markets as a whole is still in the very early years(assuming they don't fail and collapse).

To simply say that BTC will be no. 1 for the next 10 years is naive and short-sighted. Emerging and new technologies cause paradigm shifts in markets. I believe that between 2023-2025 we will see Ethereum 's market cap equal or exceed that of BTCs. BTC is good for being a store of value and a hedge against inflation. Ethereum is that and more. It is a triple-point asset.

1. a monetary asset which can be used as a store of value.

2. A commodity(used to pay for blocks).

3. A capital asset (staking).

Also ERC-20 tokens(50% of the alt market) can be built along with Dapps(Decentralized applications). There are probably additional uses that I am missing.

Point being, with regards to use-case, ETH is simply better technology with more uses when compared to BTC. Again, I am not saying BTC is bad or dying. BTC does one thing really well. That is to act as a store of value and hedge against inflation. It will continue to do this well for many years to come. 

**A comparative insightful example of what could happen:**

Cell phones. Before 2007 personal phones were primarily flip-phones and had keyboards. There was no “touch screen” device where the full UI consisted of a touch screen(bye bye buttons!).

Then, Apple has its big debut- the iphone. The rest is history. Did Motorola and Nokia die off? Absolutely not, but they no longer lead the cell phone industry. I believe that ETH is the Apple of crypto. 

This could very well be the beginning of the “Ethereum Era” whereas the past 10 years have been dominated by BTC.

Again this is all speculation. I know nothing. You know nothing. Your favorite Youtuber also knows absolutely nothing. This is just the bias opinion of somebody whose crypto portfolio is 90% Ethereum"

CryptoCurrency,"PSA: Don't post personal information on other subreddits! Keep your crypto and personal details to yourself. Hello /r/cc,

I've seen lots of PSAs pertaining to cryptocurrency here, but I'm here to share with you some basic Reddit advice I followed before I even joined the sub. I'm posting this because I have seen a few egregious violations of this advice. **Do not share personal details of your life on Reddit.** This goes for where you live, how many siblings you have, or where you ate for lunch today. One or two of these spread out amongst all the naughty subreddits you go too might not be a big deal, but if you make a habbit of it, scammers can make a habbit out of you. 

I know this is harder on more specific subreddits. You want to share how many ETH you bought last night, that you saw Giannis at a restaurant after a Bucks game, or that your Aunt (who is a nurse) has been asking you about ETF advice, but be smarter. If it helps just post some fluff here and there, you can be from Iowa in one subreddit and New Foundland in another, but do not connect the dots of your life accross subreddits. In fact, I don't even have any cryptocurrency, I just enjoy the conversation here with you fine folk. Just be smart, and happy posting."

CryptoCurrency,"International transaction fees Several ""American"" exchanges, like Gemini and Coinbase, are charged as international by some American banks when debit is used to buy crypto. I've spoken to Gemini CS and they claim to have no idea why, that my bank is responsible. I talked to my bank and they said Gemini uses an international bank. 

This fee amounts to 3% and I am particularly irked because Gemini claims to work so hard for regulatory compliance. I'm just trying to hunt down as much information as possible, because I think this \*might\* be a racket, and deserves some journalistic attention."

CryptoCurrency,"What a smart contract really is So I see a lot of people explain what a smart contract is and usually they are wrong. Me, I actually know what a smart contract is and today I am going to explain what it is.

# What is a smart contract?

A smart contract is a contract but smart.

# That really doesn't help

Essentially, me making this post right now is actually a smart contract. When I make a post, a smart contract is made between me and Reddit saying that I am going to make this post and I will not break any of Reddit's rules. This contract is of course on the Ethereum blockchain, where it remembers all the post made on Reddit.

# Why are they useful?

They are useful because you can do some cool things with it. Anybody can make a smart contract. Another example is when you want to send 100 Ethereum to your neighbor every Saturday. You can make a smart contract that remembers it and always sends that 100 Ethereum to your neighbor, it even sends them when you are dead. That's why it's called a smart contract, it's a contract, but it actually remembers what it's used for, unlike contracts.

# Why do they exist?

They exist so they can make everyone's life miserable.

# Why would I ever listen to a Monkey?

Because why not?

Anyways, that is what a smart contract is. Stay tuned for more tutorials coming to your favorite subreddit!"

CryptoCurrency,"Best crypto for fast, secure, low fee, B2B payments that also offers price stability? Good evening together,

i am the manager of a company(wholesaler) with around 6 million yearly volume of sales.
We have business to business customers only and they are all around europe.

We buy our stuff from all around the globe.
In our business time is very important - to react and buy quick is key. 

One of the daily big issues is, that we lose so much time and money for payments(supplier waits for money to ship - bank to bank sometimes 3days - so unreal; customer makes big order we wait for money to arrive - in total 6days waiting for nothing). 

It's really hard to accept and i am looking for a way to overcome this problem. Also it would give me and my business partners such a huge speed advantage and much more trust.

With crypto i could order, pay instant with low fees and supplier could ship instant. What a dream! 

What currencies would you recommend? 
I need fast speed, highly secure, low fees aaand very important: price stability 

I am excited for your suggestions"
CryptoCurrency,"Autocorrect News 4/19/2021 As stated above, here is the news from my iPhone’s word bank:

“Good afternoon buddy.
Thank goodness for checking out the other avenues of course.
I have to stop at the park and park in my driveway.”

Please leave your thoughts on this breaking information below. Is it FUD? Bullish?

Let us know!"
CryptoCurrency,"If you're planning on long-term holding. A bear- or bull-market right now doesn't really matter. Almost everyone I see on this sub is stating one thing and one thing only: HODL💎🙌🙌. 

Of course I would agree with this. The only reason you will not hold is that you reached the target for your exit strategy or that you will not believe that crypto has a future anymore. For most of us this is not the case. Everyone here thinks that crypto is still in his baby steps and this means that it would be a waste to get out now.

What does this mean? It means that you're here for a long term investment. Hoping that in a few years we can retire early, be able to buy a house or to make sure your kids can go to college.

So if you don't plan to cash out before a year of 5/6 maybe more. Why care if BTC is 30k or 50k, for both possibilities we wouldn't get out. If the market is rising 10% in one day, a lot of people get hyped and if it crashes the same amount, some get depressed. But in the long term this really doesn't matter. Buying ADA at $1.20 or $1.50 doesn't really matter if you want to cash out at $10. Buying BTC at 30k or 50k doesn't matter if you think it will reach 500k.

People care way too much about these margins, just invest what you can at the time that you want and don't wait endlessly on the ""perfect"" price to buy.

Ps. Of course it is always a good option to have a portion of your wallet available to buy a dip. And I'm not saying that you should use this part to buy crypto now you've read this. I'm saying that you don't have to worry that a market is dipping or rising. And you certainly shouldn't feel bad if you bought higher that the current price. In ten years you'll laugh about these margins."

CryptoCurrency,"DCA a week keeps the FOMO away Like with for our body, apples are healthy and keeps us healthy.

For crypto is DCAing per week (or monthly) a good way to keep our finance and sanity healthy (as long as you only spend what you can afford to lose).

No matter if dip, major dip, baby peak or sideway movement, when you DCA regulary you will spend your fiat most of the time when the crypto price is not at peak times because peaks only last few weeks and sideway last months or years. You also have no fiat left to FOMO since everything you afford to lose is already used in DCAing. FOMO usually makes you lose.

DCA helps sanity because you have a simple and clear plan. No matter what price, you invest the same amount everytime. Up and downs of the cryptocharts doesn't matter which would otherwise let your bloodpressure boil.

Once in a while when a new ATH occurs, there is positive stress and bloodpressure rises, but in a healthy way similar to doing sports and excercising. A reward for being sturdy and patient.

I hope you all stay safe, healthy and may the diamond hand watch over you."

CryptoCurrency,"What is the best cryptocurrency to invest in right now? There is no such thing as best or worse especially when you deal with crypto. However I would suggest some methods/ formula whenever you are entering this field and keep some points of caution in mind .

This is going to be long, but if you are serious about it , be patient and read it all. I am trying to be exhaustive here because I want people to know each and every aspect and invest accordingly :)

First let me get to the points of caution :-

1. Never get greedy and put all your money in crypto. Put max 10–20% of your portfolio even if you get very high returns.

2. Keep track of your investments(except 1 scenario which I will mention below 1st point in formula). Don’t invest in crypto if you want to forget it/ if you see /check your portfolio after 2–3 days. It needs constant attention (unlike mutual funds for eg)

3. Avoid FOMO - just because someone else is investing doesn’t mean you also need to invest. It doesn’t work like that, everyone’s journey is different.

4. Be alert of news of ban/ regulation of crypto in India but Till then don’t be afraid and make use of it as it’s not illegal at all right now. Also if there is any. Ban, they will give you appropriate time to put your money in bank(hopefully!!). Also be prepared to pay tax for any returns you get(don’t try to bypass it)

5. Don’t use your salaried account for transactions(I believe it’s best all these apps shouldn’t be given access to our salaried accounts)

6. Just because there has been a very amazing past performance doesn’t mean it’s going to perform the same way in future. Be smart about it

7. Whenever I mention profit % , loss % also applies parallels(I.e high profit % chance of 1 crypto then high loss % chance also of that cryto)

8. There is a saying don’t put all your eggs in basket- try to apply here (might not be possible everytime)"
CryptoCurrency,"Opinion: Surviving Crab markets is what make you Rich. People always say ""bull markets make you money, but bear markets make you rich"". 

While this may be true, the reality is most people are not ballsy enough to buy during or shortly after a freefall. 

In a crab market, most of the high adrenaline emotional based FOMO/FUD is out of the system, and you can slowly invest and grow your investment.

I've been in crypto since late 2014, and one of the biggest failures that I see from others like myself, other than paper handing and giving up during crashes, is **boredom during crab markets**.

Bitcoin crabbed for most of 2015, and I ended up slowly losing interest as I had a bunch of other real life problems.

I never sold; but I ended up taking a hiatus, until the top of the 2017 bull run. 

Got hyped again, still diamond handed my holdings, but lost interest again because of real life and the following crab market during late 2018-'19 etc. until may of this year again.

I've seen many people like me, some of them in this very sub. And while I myself have made some very good gains, I missed out on the best part of each of the previous bull runs. I could have made so much more.

Crab markets see most of the good development. Because usually, either some new development (like ICOs in 2017 or DeFi in 2020) drives the bull run, or perhaps the bull run drives these new developments.

But there's so much opportunity right at the cusp of a new bull run; for example, we saw DOT, UNI, CAKE, SUSHI etc; all relatively new coins that really exploded this current bull market.

Previously, there was NEO, NANO, VET, to name a few.

The challenge isn't trying to time the market to buy at the bottom.

The challenge is to continue persisting and not giving up or forgetting about it, and pay attention to new developments every once in a while so you don't miss out on the next bull run."

I would really like these kind of project be put forward a little more in the crypto world. It would make mining and overall crypto much more ecologically acceptable and even rally communities around mining farm projects. What do you guys think ?

Someone could even develop a specific crypto currency build around the fact that it would be carbon neutral. The vegetables and fruits grown in these greenhouses could even help fight fresh food desert in certain region.

CryptoCurrency,"Fixing Wonky Portfolio Hi all,

LONG time lurker and I don’t wanna bore too many people but… I’ve been into crypto since way back and everyone around me talked me out of it and I missed out on lots (probably 100k+) gains because of that. 

Jumped back in not too long ago when all was green and good but made the fatal error of spreading my money too thin and buying 20ish coins. Obviously I’ve seen the error of my ways here and the reason I write this is because must be lots of people on a similar boat. Stupidity / Blind greed and optimism fucked me. 

Now what I wondered was peoples opinions on fixing this. I dont want to sell all my ‘moonshots’ particularly at a loss right now and lots have low Mcap and are relatively new (I did research them not safe moon types). But from now on should I just DCA into the ‘main’ ones like BTC / ETH and forget the others and hope they make it up or more (no time scale needed the money can afford to be in there). 

Also say I had a goal of 3ETH and 0.3BTC would you but 100 of each each Month or go all in on one until your goal then move down to the next and so on. 

Guess im more wondering what other people do than asking for advice as such. I have rambled on so if you made it this far. Well done."
CryptoCurrency,"""Convert to Reddit Coins"" button (desktop site) This is the first time I've noticed the button on the sidebar. A lot of people here are very protective of their moons (myself included) and would never consider converting them for reddit coins, but for anyone that has tried it, how was your experience? Also, what's the conversion rate? 

I realize this button adds value to moons because reddit coins can be bought with cash, but is it worth it? Would it make more sense to simply sell your moons through one of the many platforms then purchase the reddit coins with money from the moon sale? 

Just some thoughts that came to mind."
CryptoCurrency,"Be aware of sophisticated phishing scams It seems almost silly to be warning people about email phishing scams today, they've been a joke for about as long as I can remember. Always something that happened to some guys poor sap grandparents, etc.

But even as a generation better versed in technology, it always pays to be aware and never assume we're too clever to fall for a phishing link. Case in point, [this almost convincing email claiming to be from Coinbase I just received.](https://i.imgur.com/KIuSnGz.png) Spoiler alert; those links don't lead where they pretend to lead, though I've no doubt the fake pages beyond them would be pretty convincing if you weren't paying attention. With potentially thousands of dollars on the line, the phishing will become more and more sophisticated. Always check email addresses (and double check your double checking; domain spoofing is a thing), never follow a link in an email unless you're *certain* it leads where it says it does.

Be careful out there!"

CryptoCurrency,DCA or just buying regularly? I must say that I think it’s cool that crypto has given many of my friends a new vocabulary. Most with corp jobs who have had corp sponsored 401ks and perhaps even buy stocks didn’t know about Dollar Cost Averaging as example. But along comes a bull market in crypto and suddenly all my friends are DCAing vs “just buying what I can afford every paycheck.”
CryptoCurrency,"Increasing my DCA as a broke(ish) person. Hey everyone, 

I worked really hard to make my 100 karma but here we are, finally being able to post.

I wanted to share some of the things I did to increase my bi-weekly investments toward crypto in hopes that it helps some of you. All $ shown is in CAD.

TLDR; everything after this will be an extension to this piece, most important tip i can give to those making ends meet is having a serious sit down with yourself and calculating your expenses over the past 6 months. Find the spending habits that are consistent and cut as many of them as you feel comfortable, more you cut, more possible gains in the end.

1. I was a consistent smoker, smoking 2 packs every 3 days costing me about 250$ a month it was hard but after 4 months of weening I finally moved on to vaping costing me 20$ a month with the same amount of nicotine to me. Giving me an extra 230$ a month to crypto.

2. Coffee and snacks: now this was a massive one for me  i couldn't believe the amount i was spending on almost daily snack buys. Chocolate  one day chips another etc. Even though it may not look like much and you view it as ""the one little thing you treat yourself with""  cut it, and thank yourself later, on average i would spend 50$ a month on snacks and 100$ in coffee, I quit drinking coffee which was easy for me but may end up being extra difficult for you but stick to it and if it helps change out your daily habits, I feel this helps a lot when cutting a habitual action. 

3. Alcohol and weed: another doozy, probably for a lot of us, but let me just start with this, if you do not have ""a lot"" of money, whatever that is to you, cut your habit. Doesn't have to be perfect but 100$ a week/month is a huge net waste that you could turn into massive profits later, and again you'll be thanking yourself later, as will your body. Don't go out drinking every weekend, if that's your thing, cut it to every other week, then once a month. Stop filling your fridge with beer and your freezer with vodka, its just not worth it, and the incentive is fantastic if you are struggling with alcoholism. For me I was a social drinker I would go out 1-3 times a week spending around 400$ a month, with weed I would spend 280$ a month(1 expensive ounce looking back) now I still smoke an ounce a month but have found myself a friend who sells to me for 60$/Oz and I stopped going out to drink. 

All in all cutting these habits over the last year has changed my 100$ bi-weekly investment into a 450 bi-weekly investment, along with leasing a car and working less hours. Even now I could cut more out of my life and probably benefit heavily from it later but i'm happy with what I have achieved so far, and I believe if you start no matter how small, you would too. Don't be perfect but genuinely try, you're worth it.

Also I make 2k a month after taxes (thats only 2.8$ over minimum wage where I live)"
CryptoCurrency,"Looking to fill my bags for the possible future ""bear market"", tell me potentially good runner ups to stack!

CryptoCurrency,"The case for PolkaDot (DOT) as an astute buy **Overview:** Polkadot is a heterogeneous multi-chain interchange and translation architecture which enables customised side-chains to connect with public blockchains. Essentially Polkadot enables scalability by allowing specialized blockchains to communicate with each other in a secure, trust-free environment.   

**What makes PolkaDot unique:** Polkadot enables a multi chain network which can scale, specialise and work together through sharing data.    

**Current reasons to invest:**    
    
**1. It appears to be undervalued according to some key metrics.**    Polkadot is trading far below its 200 day exponential moving average at -43.5% (20.4166 200EMA to 11.53 current) compared to Bitcoin which is -16.4% (36,818.32 200EMA to 30,750.20 current), Etherium which is up +12.4% (1,624.7640 200EMA to current 1,826.73) and ADA which is +39% (0.849238 200EMA to 1.1808 current). Further metrics has been covered in more depth by [u/galensmith](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/olpxi3/polkadot_seems_undervalued_key_metric_analysis/).    
    
** 2. High Yield Staking**    
You can currently earn up to 12% APY staking DOT. Kraken offers ~12% APY, Binance Earn offers ~11% while staking from a DOT wallet has a estimated 13% APY but it is important to note that you require a minimum of 40 DOT to stake and earn rewards from an official wallet.    
    
**3. Parachains are imminent**   
Parachains are individual blockchains running in parallel within the Polkadot ecosystem (the Polkadot and Kusama networks). The design of the Polkadot ecosystem enables parachains and parathreads to interoperate and communicate with each other, allowing the exchange of data and assets, and to connect to external chains outside the network, such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, using bridges. This flexibility addresses the problems of scalability, security and interoperability that have hampered blockchain development. Parachains are currently being rolled out with parachain auctions are due to be launched by Polkadot in late 2021. [Source:](https://polkadot.network/launch-roadmap/).   
    
**4. 4. High Institutional Ownership**    
As of 16th of July PolkaDot has the 3rd highest instiutional ownership behind Bitcoin and Etherium, indicating institutional faith in Polkadot’s medium term sucess. [Source:](https://coinshares.com/research/digital-asset-fund-flows	)    
    

**Overview: ** Polkadot appears to be quite undervalued at the moment which combined with instituional faith, a high APY yield from staking and imminent novel process releases makes it a good Cryptocurrency to pick up for a medium term hold.


*Disclaimer: I am a casual long term investor in Crytocurrency so please do your own research if you plan on investing in DOT as this post does not constitutes financial advice.*"
CryptoCurrency,"I invented new consensus protocol - how to proceed? Hi, after working for some (long) time, I formulated a proposition for a new consensus protocol in blockchain networks. I wanted to create a protocol that achieves true decentralisation, both in its operation and distribution of coins as rewards (so decentralising wealth). I believe that PoS blockchains can't do that, because they must distribute coins initially to some small group of investors and then those investors get the block rewards. Protocols using some real-world resources (like hashing in PoW) eventually get centralised, as few entities, using technological optimisation of hardware (ASICs), geographically-dependent advantages (cheap electricity in some parts of the world) or just through economies of scale (buying hardware cheaper) eventually capture the distribution of coins and wealth coming from the system.

My proposition:

\-Proof-of-Used-Bandwidth: the more Internet bandwidth a user invests, the more likely he is to become a block producer.

\-Geographically-bounded blockchains: there is not just one blockchain; everyone can create a blockchain version that uses Proof-of-Used-Bandwidth, but only the bandwidth originating from a selected geography (from a country or even a region) can be used to compete to produce a block in this blockchain version.

\-All geographically-bounded blockchains are interoperable without the need for some central chain over all of them. So even if there are many blockchains, and each one allows to use bandwidth from a specific region, still all form one whole.

Advantages:

\-In each blockchain users compete based on same conditions: if it's the same country, they have similar bandwidth costs (I'm assuming that they are buying bigger amounts of dedicated bandwidth), similar cost of hardware (no ASICs apply here, because it uses bandwidth, so cannot be optimised like this), same electricity costs, etc. This is a great advantage, because there really is not much that can cause an oligopoly.

\-Unlimited scalability, because there are many (theoretically unlimited number) networks, each covering some area, and all are interoperable with each other. No need for central chain over all of them.

I think it can be an interesting idea and I analysed the design that I came up with repetitively for quite some time and couldn't find a flaw.

However, this design is very complex and it's described on many pages. What should I do with it now? If it could work, and I believe it could, it would be a very big step forward. But I don't know anyone in crypto-space and my name is completely unknown. I would like this to become someday a community-driven project.

I don't want anything from anyone and I'm not trying to promote myself or my idea. I just want a hint from someone ""in the know"" - how should I progress now? The whitepaper and detailed documentation are on my website:

CryptoCurrency,"What is the real appeal of trading crypto? An article by Peter Hengst

	On any given day, at any given time, there is an enormous amount of money that is traded in the digital currency market. Buyers are spending fiat currency to purchase more crypto and expand their portfolios. Sellers are making a profit or cutting their losses and dumping huge amounts of their portfolios in order to “cash out.” While the average individual goes about their day at work, crypto day traders are participating in a very volatile work space where millions of dollars can be made or lost within seconds. Who are these people who are willing to accept this demanding lifestyle and extremely high level of daily stress?

	Pioneers. These folks, who in some cases, put their entire livelihood on the line ever day are the REAL PIONEERS of a currency revolution. As long as there have been human beings on this planet, there have been pioneers. People who risk or sacrifice much more than anyone else in order to bring about a change or an advancement for mankind. If Christopher Columbus never traveled by ship across the Atlantic seeking the “new world” of North America, or if Lewis and Clark never journeyed through the rough terrain that they did in order to reach the Oregon coast then our world would be a lot different. We need these types of pioneers to propel us into the next way of the future.

	The importance of change in the way we as human beings view money cannot be overstated. The current monetary system is dated and due for an upgrade. This is what drives an industry like cryptocurrency even in the face of such a high level of volatility. The individuals involved in this industry do not feel that it is too risky to predict that the idea of money can be viewed entirely differently. Why should anyone be at the mercy of a bank or institution in order to get the access to the money that they have earned or saved? Why can’t an individual send all or some or fractions of their own money to anyone in the world instantly with their smartphone that is already connected to most of the globe via the internet? These questions are at the very core of human curiosity. Every time a major change has come throughout history, it started with a question of why.

	Does all of this mean that the people who search the web for get rich quick schemes and wait for free airdrops from up-and-coming token companies are as important to history as explorers of new worlds and trail blazers? No. It means that collectively, every single person involved in the evolution of money including folks in the crypto space are paving the way for a better future. Taking risks and making sacrifices are simply a stepping stone toward the eventual goal of a one-world-currency. Traders might make a trade that doesn’t pan-out and they lose their initial investment. Buyers and sellers may choose to complete an order that immediately backfires several minutes later. Regardless of the possibility of these scenarios, those of us in this industry understand the importance of what we are trying to accomplish and there is nothing that will stop us. So yeah, the real appeal of crypto isn’t exactly to get-rich-quick. It is to get the idea of a more fair and just monetary system to be adopted by the rest of the world so that we can all live better and without financial oppression."

It seems like everyday there is hope and FUD for crypto in India - more and more exchanges are setting up shop here yet we hear news stories about regulations incoming (earlier, they used to be bans).

Much of the recent news was based on the fact that one of the few annual sessions of the Indian Parliament would be held this month and a cryptocurrency bill was thought to be discussed, brining clarity to the local market.

However, as per the latest news, no cryptocurrency bill would be listed this session which means there would be no changes to the laws until the next session at least, which would start in November. 

Currently there are a lot of pressing issues to be discussed and cryptocurrency did not make the cut. To make things worse, there is a new phone spying scandal that just started which will definitely affect the current session making the real work done even less.

We have all heard it, even those of us who are new to the space.  This is a warning about exchanges getting hacked, or going bankrupt, and that Cryptocurrency that you got to look at whenever you logged in simply vanishing.

&amp;#x200B;

I knew this was true, I know this is true, but I had three reasons to keep my coins on an exchange.    


1.)  The gas fees are too high.  I'm definitely a dabbler, I don't have a huge purse, and moving my coins was just too much of a percentage loss for me to stomach.  


2.)  I'm a bumbling fool.  I lose my physical (cash, license, debit card) wallet every 18 months due to general incompetence.  Luckily my bank account isn't emptied every time, but my wallet is.  If something like this were to happen with my Trezor (or, more accurately, with my seed phrase), it's gone gone without any sort of customer support to help me out.  


3.)  My exchange gives me interest on my holdings.  I know this is because they are staking or lending, and they are making more on it than they are paying me, but it takes the work out of my hands, and there is some value in that.  


These 3 reasons were only balanced by the fact that my holdings were small, and if I lost it all to a hack, that wasn't the end of the world.  However I've now been buying a bit more every week, and now my holdings are starting to add up.  It's at least worth more than my crappy 10 year old car.

&amp;#x200B;

So my question for the room is, when does it become worth it to make the transfer?  I'm 60% in Eth and Btc, and 40% in a dozen altcoins (I know that's imbalanced.  I hit minimums to receive interest on alt coins, now I'm DCAing into Btc and Eth to eventually reach a better balance).

CryptoCurrency,"Does Bitcoin’s current price relative to the $ a bad thing for the idea of cryptocurrency? Looking at Bitcoin’s original white paper, it’s focus was on making a widely useable, worldwide, online, cryptocurrency.

“What is needed is an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust, allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted third party. 

Transactions that are computationally impractical to reverse would protect sellers from fraud, and routine escrow mechanisms could easily be implemented to protect buyers.”

Of course since then, Bitcoin has become a phenomenon in terms of it’s purported value against the $.

And yet, I can’t help think that inflated value stands against its original use case and actively prohibits Bitcoin from being adopted on a mass scale - and through association, prevents cryptocurrency doing the same.

So what I’d like to ask you is;

• What do you see as Bitcoin’s primary use case now?

and

• Is Bitcoin’s price relative to the dollar a bad thing for the idea of cryptocurrency?"
CryptoCurrency,"There is a strong possibility of a long bear market. Beware of holding too many altcoins, many of them will just die. A lot of 2017 'favourites' are not even mentioned today. The price action on BTC has been rather week since the May crash, and many traders now feel that we are entering a strong bear period. Different targets are being discussed for the bottom, some feel it would be 25k some 15k and some think it may go even lower. 

While BTC plays out, many would also be holding altcoins through this bear run. While alts are great during a bull run, during a BTC bear cycle they are some of the worst assets to hold. 

During the 2017 bull run too, many favourite altcoins emerged that were shilled here relentlessly. Today you will not find anyone talking about them, and possibly the team / coin has folded too. Some examples are Request Network, Power ledger, Substratum, Vertcoin, Groestlecoin, Waltcon chain, Dash, Qtum, Bytecoin, Omise Go, Ardor, Game Credits, Stratis, Dragon Chain, KIN, Factom etc. These coins also had a huge following back in 2017 bull run. Many were expecting these coins to ""change the world"". Daily's from 2017 and 2018 were filled with mentions of these conis. Some of these coins were notorious and there were massive threads full of shills trying to explain how a chain would take over the world and change businesses for good. 

Ultimately, most of these coins had to fold either due to lack of funds, lack of planning, or just a soft exit scam where the team kinda go MIA during a 2 year bear run. The soft exit scam is the most common and least effort one - in crypto, the developers have to develop something, but they can always say they tried and failed. On to the next one. Tough luck! There are no legal contracts in place that force the devs to deliver anything for you, the token holder. 



In this 2020-21 bull run, there are way more altcoins. Many of them clearly struggle for even a single use case. The story with most altcoins is that the devs use them to raise funds,  come up with a list of promises and then abandon them. The IDO/IEO culture has resulted in thousands of fund raises for just copy cat projects that dont have any viable future. Many of the swaps and DEX we have now wont be around in just 2 years from now. The tokens associated with them will be worth nothing. 

Of course, some of the promising alts will be available for dirt cheap prices during the bear market and have a chance of gaining back their ATHs, but for most other projects the fall to earth is going to be more or less permanent."
CryptoCurrency,"Risk of mining stable coins Hello together,

i recently started mining stable coins, because i saw several exchanges offering very attractive APY's (up to insanely 14%)
Talking about crypto.com, Nexo etc.

I am thinking about shoving more money into stable coin staking, but to be honest it's hard for me to estimate the risk of losing all.

Like what are the chances a big player like, for example crypto.com will go down. And if they do, is all my money gone?

CryptoCurrency,"What are some most common Crypto scams No one likes to lose their hard-earned money. People enter into crypto to get rich but due to lack of knowledge. 
Will results in bad publicity for crypto and less participation from new users.


What are the most common Crypto scams?

There are many actually and new ones appear every day so you have to be aware.

Fake Bitcoin Exchanges. Scammers present themselves as a part of a big trading platform than scam you once you transfer funds to them

Cloud mining. Scammers ask if you want to buy equipment for mining which will stay on their end. Don’t get me wrong there are some good companies out there but they don’t advertise and get oversubscribed quickly.

Fake ICO/IEO/IDO. Scammers impersonate admin of a big project and ask you for some funds in turn for good allocation in tokens. Good projects will never write you first.

Fishing scam. Always check the links and info you’re typing on a platform. This is the most common scam for google SERP results. Be aware.

Fake wallets. Scammers will ask you to download some upgraded version of BTC wallet. Don’t fall for this, and always use official websites for wallets.

Fake hardware wallets. Don’t buy hardware wallets from anywhere except official stores. This devices can later compromise your funds.

I might forget some, please share your thoughts in the comments below.

Always remember, cryptocurrency transactions are irreversible so if you don’t pay much attention to your security no-one will help you to recover your funds. It’s like giving your pocket cash to a scammer and then complain to police for it.


Always be careful, it feels so bad to see someone lose all of their life earnings. 
Never share your seed phrase.
Always buy hardware wallet from official sites.
If you stuck somewhere look for general solution and try it yourself without giving your information to anyone else."
CryptoCurrency,"What is your pet project? What is your favorite cryptocurrency project and why?


I'm in a crossroads right now, it used to be EGLD but while I keep researching more and more, I'm starting to shift towards Algo.

CryptoCurrency,"A few questions about Trezor vs Ledger Hi - I'm trying to research what would be the best hardware wallet for me and I've narrowed it down to probably either a Ledger Nano X or Trezor Model T, though I'm leaning toward the Ledger.   I'm trying to understand the premium price of the Trezor and why so many people recommend it, thus a few questions:

&amp;#x200B;

1. One of the features that I like about the Ledger is the ability to view all of my balances offline - am I correct in understanding that the Trezor must be plugged in even just to view your portfolio?
2. My understanding is I can still stake e.g. Ada with the Ledger - but I couldn't find any information as to whether this feature was available with the Trezor.
3. Trezor's source code on Github is an often cited ""feature"" - but is there any way to validate that the code they've shared is what is actually on the device?
4. I see Trezor's touch display as more of an anti-feature... looking at YT videos it seems pretty dang small.  Would someone with normal adult hands have a difficult time using it?  Am I going to have to keep a stylus handy?

&amp;#x200B;

inb4:

In researching other posts on the subject here, I see a lot of common responses of ""but Ledger's marketing database was hacked!"" - disappointing, yes, but not the end of the world.  My contact info is already all over the Internet.  I'm more concerned about the device security.  I don't see a lot of discussion over Trezor's [actual device hack](https://www.coolwallet.io/kraken-hacks-trezor-in-15-minutes/) \- has this been patched?"
CryptoCurrency,"Last time to get Eth under 4k! 3k! 2k! | What I learned from buying Crypto at ATH’s I constantly see people saying how crypto right now is at a huge discount. And although I agree in regards to the future that I speculate these prices will be. Let’s not be so quick to forget what the prices were just 6 months ago.

As of January 1st 2021:

• Amp: &gt;1 penny 
• Ada: 18 cents 
• Algo: 40 cents 
• Link: $11.88 
• Eth: $730 
• Btc: $29,400

And this is why you should never “chase” all time highs. I remember many (including myself) saying “last time to get Eth under $4,000. And all though this is “good” when you think of a 10k Eth, you shouldn’t rule out just how high Crypto is this year.

And I think this “Buy the dip” mentality is pretty ridiculous. If you’re going to buy crypto, buy to accumulate more at the best prices you can, but don’t be too concerned that we’re no where near ATH’s at this current moment. 

Crypto is a long term game, the patient ones win out, don’t expect to get rich quick and don’t be distraught when you’re down. However, with this information, we can be better prepared to make better decisions in the future. 

This is not financial advice, but I remember someone saying in the daily once: “Don’t sell on red days and don’t buy on Green Day’s” -it’s simple but effective. But remember, you’re not buying the dip, you’re buying to accumulate for the long haul (assuming it’s not a shit coin/ scam). Do your DD, DCA, don’t FOMO chasing ATH, don’t capitulate, and keep a grounded perspective about where we are now in comparison to where we were not even more than a year ago.

I remember seeing BTC at 3k and laughing at the “fools” who didn’t sell at 11k. This was in 2019, as long as you believe in the future of crypto (and not your favorite rug pull shit coin) you have to assume you’ll need to hodl to make a profit to reduce the risk in a volatile market. In the end I was the fool, but, no more. I hope, this may help someone learn from my mistakes.

Oh and lastly don’t believe the 95% of the youtubers you see saying “_____ will moon next!!!”"
CryptoCurrency,"What are Pool Splitters? And why you should choose a Single Pool Operator. (Cardano) If you haven’t heard this term before it wouldn’t surprise me. Stake pools are relevantly new.

**Pool Splitters** are pool operators that have done so well, that they need to create more pools because their first is at the limit. Or they are doing well enough to create another pool even before saturation, say 50% saturation.

As a business model its great. They do well, and want to keep doing well, so they create another pool.

Most are successful YouTubers.

There are a few problems with this though.

First, lets talk about what you really care about, yourself.

As a delegator, your want best rewards. Sure you may like the cause of the content, but at the end of the day you want the most ADA you can get for delegating.

If you look at these pool splitters most have 4-5% margins. Even when the stake is still low, its set the same.

So while I agree 5% margin for a fully saturated pool might not be bad, its certainty not giving the best rewards to their delegators.

Then you have the bigger problem of supporting decentralization and new pools.

If the ideal pool count is 500 today, that means the best possible layout is 500 unique entities running 500 different single pools.

But if you look at the numbers [https://adapools.org/groups](https://adapools.org/groups) you’ll see thats not the case.

63 pools are Binace (that’s a whole other problem)

29 pools for PCT

9 pools New Girl

I could go on, check out the list yourself

Single Pool operators hold only 22% of all the stake.

The rest is held by groups with more then 1 pool, and a third of ADA is still on Exchanges staked with them.

In fact of the top 500 pools, you won't find many that only have 1 pool.

So if you want the **BEST** returns, and to **support the best decentralization**, choose one of the many single pool operators out there.

Check out their website.

Check out their team.

Check out their infrastructure (many are not ready for smart contracts)

As an added bonus, they will likely give you the best personal attention as well, because they are trying to grow their pools."

CryptoCurrency,"Anyone here old enough to remember what happened when banks first started offering their clients Apple Stock? If not, here's a quick recap: The media told everyone that Apple was not a good stock to buy or hold and that everyone who owns it should sell it before it crashes and dies during its early days, all while at the same time Banks were adding it to their asset catalog, blocked a majority of their clients from being able to buy it, and only allowed their most wealthy clients to add it to their portfolios.

Sound familiar? It was some hell of what felt like an endless stream of FUD that they spread on Apple, which as you may know is only the most valuable company in the world today.

They scared my poor immigrant dad who came to this country with nothing and started investing in his youth, out of his Apple stock in the '97 for a small $40k profit with their endless stream of FUD news lies. That news stopped him from ever investing back into the market.

And that stock he was scared into selling would be worth millions today. I can only imagine how many other people they scared out of that stock and others like it, who could have greatly improved their lives with those internet tech stock assets.

If you're in this subreddit, you may be interested in investing. I'd love to get your thoughts on a problem I have.

I've been investing for about a decade, have a decent amount of experience, &amp; have reached that point in my life where I'd rather not have to check/work on my portfolio frequently.

I'm struggling to find a way to deal with this. Robos are boring &amp; uncustomizable, &amp; I'm not sure I want to trust/pay an FA.

Basically: I want to use my experience to set up my ideal investing strategy, &amp; then let it run in a way that doesn't require (or encourage) my attention. This could mean things like periodic rebalances, &amp;/or push-notification style alerts to let me know when there has been meaningful portfolio movement. Otherwise, I want it out of sight &amp; out of mind.

So my question: Can you relate to this? What have you done to solve this kind of problem, if anything? I've seen some posts around this, trying to figure out if it's a real problem for folks.

Even if you haven't solved it, I'd love to hear from you. I'm considering building something if no good alternative exists. Would love to hear from you in the comments.

I'm presuming that the influx of new alts and shitcoins has seriously skewed the BTC dominance ratio. And I presume we will see more and more alts in the future

If we compare the prices from the top, most alts lost 50% in BTC price and that's all fine. What is strange is that BTC dominance still hovers around 45%

If BTC is to retake 70% or 80% dominance in the future, alts could see some serious damage. And I am not talking about shiba or safemoon. I am talking about serious projects that are losing value when compared to BTC 

We all hoped that the last bear would clean some of the shitcoins and only serious projects would thrive but this bull showed that shitcoins pumped the hardest

So when the first giant dip happened (btc to 32k) I have lost most of my profits but thankfully I was still in green.
But while I was watching this dip I have realized what a fool I have been, I have never took a single profit I was just being greedy all the time.
So, please if you ever invest money anywhere, put in the money you are prepared to lose and ALWAYS take profits.
While everything was growing and of course dipping I was constantly watching all the graphs and I slowly started to become obsessed with crypto. But now when I dont have my money in crpyto I feel so much more relaxed and if I went back in time I would tell myself to just hold (and not open my binance app every 5mins) until I reach my goal of profit.

In fact, enthusiasts have called it a[""monetary revolution.""](https://hirecryptohacker.com/ethereum-mining-software/)

 To be clear, cryptocurrencies are decentralized digital assets. It can be exchanged between users without a central authority, mostly generated through a special computational technique known as ""mining.""

 Determinants of the value of cryptocurrencies 

 Principles of the free market economy (mainly supply and demand) 

 Supply and demand are the primary determinants of the value of any security, including crypto currencies. When you are ready to sell, the price of that particular cryptocurrency will rise and vice versa. 

 Mass Adoption 

 Adopting multiple cryptocurrencies can increase their price in a month. The economic principle is that if demand increases without a corresponding increase in supply, the price of that particular product will increase. The 

, and important everyday case, is intended to facilitate communication with them.

 Fiat Inflation When fiat currencies like 

 USD and GBP rise, prices rise and purchasing power decreases. This will increase the crypto for that fiat. As a result, you will be able to earn more money. In fact, this situation is one of the main reasons for the increase in the price of Bitcoin. History of Scams and Hacks 

 Scams and hacks 

 are also important factors affecting the value of a cryptocurrency and are highly [regarded.In](https://regarded.In) some cases, a crypto-enabled device may be a con artist. They raise the price of cryptocurrencies to attract the underserved and when their hard earned money is invested, the crooks lower the price and the crooks disappear without leaving a trace 

 Therefore, it is imperative to be aware of crypto fraud before investing money in cryptocurrencies. 

 Other factors to consider affecting the value of a cryptocurrency include: 

 cryptocurrency How it is stored and usefulness, security, ease of purchase, cross-border acceptability 

 Strength of the crypto support community (including finance, innovation and member loyalty)

 Supply and demand are the primary determinants of the value of any security, including crypto currencies. When you are ready to sell, the price of that particular cryptocurrency will rise and vice versa. 

 Mass Adoption 

 Adopting multiple cryptocurrencies can increase their price in a month. The economic principle is that if demand increases without a corresponding increase in supply, the price of that particular product will increase. The 

, and important everyday case, is intended to facilitate communication with them.

 Fiat Inflation When fiat currencies like 

 USD and GBP rise, prices rise and purchasing power decreases. This will increase the crypto for that fiat. As a result, you will be able to earn more money. In fact, this situation is one of the main reasons for the increase in the price of Bitcoin. History of Scams and Hacks 

 Scams and hacks 

 are also important factors affecting the value of a cryptocurrency and are highly [regarded.In](https://regarded.In) some cases, a crypto-enabled device may be a con artist. They raise the price of cryptocurrencies to attract the underserved and when their hard earned money is invested, the crooks lower the price and the crooks disappear without leaving a trace 

 Therefore, it is imperative to be aware of crypto fraud before investing money in cryptocurrencies. 

 Other factors to consider affecting the value of a cryptocurrency include: 

 cryptocurrency How it is stored and usefulness, security, ease of purchase, cross-border acceptability 

 Strength of the crypto support community (including finance, innovation and member loyalty) 

 Low risks associated with cryptocurrencies perceived by investors and users 

 Sense of trust, i.e. 

 Liquidity and volatility of the cryptocurrency market

CryptoCurrency,"I'm quitting drinking, and buying crypto instead! Hey everybody in this awesome community! 👋
Sorry for any bad english, it's my second language, and sorry for posting this long story on mobile.. judge me in the comments!)
So, i am very new to crypto (like 1,5months old),but had heard about it since at least 2013. Just been on the fence about it for a long time, while still having it in my periphiral(sp.). I jumped in on Doge (yes, i'm new, and i like memes), actually made like $15 before i realized i had to diversify. Then, i lost almost everything in margin trading (i have a small gambling problem), and decided it was time for a new start! I was inspired by another post on here, about a guy who quit smoking weed and put his extra cash into crypto. Well, I have a small drinking problem i want to get rid of.. 🤔 So, now i have been clean for a week (i know not much), and have put $35 (alcohol is really expensive here) into crypto! If i keep this up, me and my wife might not have to worry about money in the future!
Thank you guys so much! For the info, the inspiration, the warnings. For everything! This community is an awesome mix of smart people, shitposters, and smart shitposters! Love you! ❤ Here's to staying clean! 🧃☕"

CryptoCurrency,"Crypto Games Review Thread I’m really interested in how some developers are using crypto in their video games / mobile games. Polygon just announced that they’re making a game specific side of their development. So clearly gamers and game are something the block is interested in. 

I know that, at the current moment, there are a *lot* of games, most of which I haven’t played. Many of them aren’t fully developed, and many of them aren’t very fun/replay-able. And there also aren’t a lot of earnest reviews of them out there. 

Anyone got links to quality, fair, reviews or have one of your own?

I’ll start. I’ve played several hours now of Town Star. It’s like a faster paced FarmVille on the block by the same guy who co-founded Zynga and worked on FarmVille, Eric Schiermeyer, but their new project is called the Gala Network. It’s pretty big, most of y’all have probably heard of it. If not, it’s easily [Googled](https://app.gala.games). 

Anyways, it was fairly fun. But it wasn’t something I’d put a bunch of time into. I feel like old games on Facebook were super addicting, but so far, I haven’t found a crypto game, Town Star included, that hooked me. I say that as someone who grew up playing Atari and Nintendo games on old consoles in the late 80s and early 90s, so I’m not adverse to old games or games that aren’t throttling a GPU to the Max. 

In Town Star, you’re competing with other players to build the most profitable farm over the allotted time. The winner gets some native coins. Unless you’re grinding and learning hardcore strategy, I don’t think you’ll be making money here for the time you’re spending. You can also causally play, but I didn’t find that all that compelling, though I did try it out before trying a competition round of Town Star. 

It would be awesome if we got a nice little thread going of game reviews, especially for the folks out there who like to play games and maybe earn a little crypto in the process. Or just for those of us looking to have a little fun using blockchain based games."
CryptoCurrency,"How to NOT Get pwnd by Pump &amp; Dumps/Sh*tcoins I’ve been seeing a lot of posts about sh*tcoins lately. Coins that pump a ton at the start, and then dump X100.

Even top 10 coins can be worthless in a year or two. So it’s not just the sh*tcoins that you need to be careful about. Here are some rules you should live by before investing into these “projects”. 

1. Don’t invest in them unless you’re literally treating them like a lottery ticket. Sure you may make money on some of these, but the majority you will lose. And not just lose, you may not even be able to salvage anything out of it due to liquidity issues and or gas fees. 

2. If you’re heading it promoted by someone, whether it be on social media, YouTube, or even Reddit, you’re already too late. These moon shots do make people A LOT of money. But it’s usually not the average investor. It’s mainly the promotors or the people behind the promoting. 

3. If a group is trying to pump a coin at 3:00pm Saturday STAY AWAY! This usually means a bunch of people are already holding the coin and when it comes time to “pump” it, these people will be dumping it and the price will actually go lower. 

4. If liquidity is an issue, stay away! Coins with low volume may quadruple in a day, but on the other side of the coin, they can also lose 1000% in one day OR you may not have any buyers at all at X price so you’ll never be able to get rid of it. 

5. Do your own DD on every coin you invest in. Talk to someone who you respect about it if you have any questions. About 99% of the time, there has to be a use case for a coin to be worth anything. Check the market cap on it. Is it feasible that if it does double/triple/etc in price, the market cap will still make sense? You can’t expect a coin to come out of nowhere and have a higher market cap than bitcoin or Ethereum. It’s just not going to happen. 

6. Check and see who owns the coin. If 90% of the coin is owned by one entity then you should probably stay away. 

7. If you’re interested in a coin, find a fanboy or the Reddit group and ask what’s so special about X coin. If they give vague answers or can’t really give any answers, then you probably should walk away. 

8. If you do invest, have an exit plan in place. Do not fomo and don’t emotion trade. Your portfolio will get wrecked if you do this. Sure if you want to put 2% of your portfolio into lottery picks, that could work. Putting all your portfolio into moonshot2022 coin is a terrible idea. 

Hope these rules helped! I hate to see people losing all their money on coins that aren’t even worth anything to begin with. You should be as careful with what you invest in as you are with your seed phrase. Not every coin should receive your money just like not everyone should have access to your seed phrase. Be smart people!"

CryptoCurrency,"Remembering the seed phrase Apart from writing down your seed phrase on paper and securing it on a safe place has anybody tried to remember it by coming up with a story with the phrases.

So i came up a  story that i woke up in the morning, had scrambled eggs for my breakfast, went for a workout, felt pretty tired, had a rest, smoked weed, watched few movies and slept. 

Coming up with a story with the seed pharase realised me that you can way remember it pretty easily. I already tried it with my trust wallet phrases and can already repeat it without any trouble. I am planning to do it everyday so that i can cement it on my head.

CryptoCurrency,"Why India need Decentralized Finance and how it can potentially save lives.  Disclaimer: This post is based on my own experience, problems that I and others that I know have faced and the research that I have done. If I am wrong about something, please correct me, I am always open to changing my mind. I am not an expert in any of the fields I am talking about, thus I will only talk about things in their most basic form. Please also bear in mind that English is not my mother tongue.

This post is made for educational content only, I hope you will learn something here that you did not before.

The world's largest ""democracy"" has almost always struggled with the finances, whether it is the utter failure of [demonetization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Indian_banknote_demonetisation) which essentially made your money instantly worthless overnight, or incredibly high interest rates from private moneylenders as well as banks for the farmers and other underprivileged. Banks screwing people over is pretty common.

The conditions of small-time farmers are pretty bad, the government has failed to show interest in improving their condition, a lot of people are undocumented and unbanked, but I could not find the solid numbers. Small landholders have to take loans at exorbitant rates, again I could not find the numbers but the Wikipedia article and some other sources say it can range from lower 30% to 60%. Not being able to pay off the debt causes these farmers to sell their crops at a significantly lower rates  than what they would actually go for in the market. Debt upon debt can lead to dire consequences 

This [report by Tata institute](https://web.archive.org/web/20130809074417/http://vnss-mission.gov.in/htmldocs/Farmers_suicide_TISS_report.pdf) cites various reasons why farmers commit suicide, this ranges from family responsibility, crop failure, debt and some lack of government interest. If you want the gist of the situation, I recommend this [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farmers%27_suicides_in_India). It more or less explains how bad the situation is, but it skips out on a lot.

There are moneylenders and landlords which are basically resorting to slavery for crop production. India, despite being an agrarian society has no infrastructure, transportation, cold storage and marketing, inefficiencies lead to significantly lower money going towards the farmers compared to other nations, that includes use of traditional practices for farming such as use of cattle for tilling the fields. 

The lack of transparency from the banks as well as government is something that should not be acceptable yet here we are, everything is getting more and more expensive here, the gas prices are more than ETH gas (I am sorry) despite being poor and majorly dependent on agriculture, India has failed its underprivileged time and again. This entire thing however is only a small part of a very big problem, and unfortunately it is not going away anytime soon.  I just find it funny that a lot of these problems can be solved with DeFi and only if people were to be educated about this. It is a double-edged sword however, it needs to be made more accessible and cheaper to use, as it stands it is far from ready to be widely adopted, but one can dream."
CryptoCurrency,"DAI stablecoin: can I get rich here? When I looked at coinbase, the charts didn't really rise much. However, I looked at gemini and saw that DAI reached 1.05 3 days ago. So if I buy and stake at 7.5%, I can just sell at 1.025 and make a decent 2.5% profit. I can set aside a good amount of money into the stablecoin for staking and unstake it whenever I get enough interest. 

I feel that this might be a good idea because the interest can yield good returns. If I manage to sell this coin whenever it goes up 2%, that's a lot of money to be made. Maybe I'm just being unreasonable because of the current state of the market."

CryptoCurrency,"What is your END goal in crypto? Many of us invest because of different reasons and goals. Some seek financial freedom, some seek ways to stop their fiat from inflation and many more.

What exactly is your end goal, and why did you join crypto?

For me, it's because i believe crypto will make me financially free one day and that I can live off staking itself. I also believe that we're still early."
CryptoCurrency,"The single best crypto trading strategy 1. Never sell precious cryptos for dirty fiat. 
2. If you think the market is going down, dump ETH and stack BTC, which is less volatile. 
3. If you think the market is going up, dump BTC and stack ETH. 

You never want to exit your exposure to the market, because it's impossible to tell when it's going to pump and leave you stranded. 

If you only use the top 2 coins, then even if you suck at guessing and get caught on the wrong end of the trade, you'll still be invested in something worthwhile. 

Continue never selling by using collateralized loans (aim for $10 in crypto for every $1 you borrow, which makes you safe from everything but a 90% market drop). In the long run ETH and BTC will appreciate faster than the interest you pay on the loans (as low as 1% interest with Celsius), so you never have to pay them off as long as you don't borrow too much. 

And best of all, never pay any taxes because you aren't repaying the loan or selling your coins. 

Tell me why I'm wrong."
CryptoCurrency,"What's the least shitty shit coin? Man, I wish I bought MANA when it was 0.09 or any other coin that had legit potential before anyone else caught on.

So many shit coins all sound the same and claim the same and its just unfortunate because legit projects, who have to say the same things and claim the same things will get buried among the scams.

For example I was invested in BTT for awhile because I figured it was a massively undervalued coin considering its freekin BIT TORRENT... but later after much research I was thinking that the business model is silly, the last thing pirates want to do is spend money lol. So I flipped it for some ETH.

But that being said, I'd love to drop $400 in 8 legit fresh, virtually unknown coins and hope for the best.

I know I'm inviting the shills here, but hopefully some of you can share some actual inside knowledge.

Thanks!"
CryptoCurrency,"It is hard to break away from traditional money mindset It's funny, it can be very difficult to get your mind to think differently to understand what crypto is doing.

Personally, I find myself always thinking in terms of fiat. How much is crypto X worth in fiat? When will I ""cash out"" and use it in the real world? 

Like that itself shows mentally I am not seeing a world where crypto is doing what cash is doing. I'm thinking can I pay off my mortgage with cash, as opposed to can I use crypto to actually own the house, with a mortgage deed written into blockchain.

Then on a wider level, this sub and the wider crypto community takes on stock trading terms. Bear markets, bull markets, using stock analysis methods and talking about market cap.

I don't have a point to make really, just an observation I guess. We talk about crypto as a game changer and disrupter but we still all think in terms of traditional finance. It'll be interesting to see if that ever changes in our lifetimes."
CryptoCurrency,"What is the advantage of pairing ALTs with BTC? I'm wondering how does the crypto market get to a place where BTC doesn't pull down (or up) the rest of the market with its volatility? In its current state, I don't even have to look at my portfolio to see it's value. I can look at BTC's movement and guess within a few dollars, because most coins are tied to BTC. My question may be moot because there may not be a way to move away from BTC as the dominant pair (or doing so, may push ALTs through the floor). It's just really odd that each project is valued against such a volatile asset, meaning regardless of their innovation, partnerships or investments, if BTC is crashing, so are they. This leads to it being impossible to diversify.

This question may not even make sense in the grand scheme of things, as I understand that other forms of investment are also tied to an asset (fiat, gold, oil, etc). As a community we ask for adoption, but really what we need is stability. Zooming out helps, yes, and of course if you look back to December 2020 things look great. I'm also confident that if you (could) look forward to December 2025 things will look amazing. But both of those views are dependent on BTC's value. It feels as though, regardless of which crypto you invest in, the market needs BTC to move for your investment to move. 

Sorry if this is all over the place, but I'd like to hear your thoughts."
CryptoCurrency,"Crypto IS Intimidating About 2 month into my crypto venture. I've done enough research so I can settle on a new project I think has potential. I'm using this investment as a virtual saving platform that I don't care if it bottoms out. I'm avoiding the big boys to try and maximise my gains. I hold my currency in Crypto.com exchange and it floats up and down (mainly down atm) but I've been hearing of stakes and wallets recently. Wondering if I'm missing out I've dared to venture out and admit my noobness!!! I've recieved a little support but **** me this field is brutal. You all seem to have a code language for everything and it seems like keeping things to yourself is an advantage??? I'm not an idiot, I know why. I've entered a few new communities of genre in the past but boooyyyyyyy is this the most intimidating. Like a pool of sharks defending their catch not going put for the kill. I don't even think theres a club.... just some well informed people having fun haha. Either way..... for a newbie.... its horrific.

CryptoCurrency,"I've learned my Crypto lessons I started my Crypto journey in April. Bought 10 different coins with borrowed money, more than I can afford: BTC, ETH, ADA, MATIC, EOS, LINK, BCH, XRP, UNI, DOT. Started day trading and locked my crypto at ATH. Then when the first dip happened in May I panick sold some of my cryptos, just before the price started to rise again and bought again at ATH. Now my portfolio is down 60-70% down. What I learned is do not day trade again , at least not with 100% of my cryptos. Now I just small DCA, and stake. This 60-70% dip was like a crypto baptism to me. I cant describe how devastated I was watching my portfolio sink in red.

CryptoCurrency,"Celsius, Nexo or Swissborg or another? I've been looking at how my crypto is distributed across wallets and I'm slightly concerned that I have too much idle, I e.

So my questions are: which of these platforms are best for yield and security of funds? What are people's experiences? Is there a catch to the high interest rates?

I understand with nexo you need a decent amount of Nexo to get the best rates, but looking at their rates for GBP I'm most tempted by them.

CryptoCurrency,"Few helpful books on Crypto If your dinner conversation with your family has been as awkward as mine where you are made silent and others fail to budge on their opinion that crypto is a gamble, a pyramid scheme and you loose the argument because of their ignorance but also partly due to your own inability to explain them better then you should consider reading some of these books which are an excellent source of information. I can't promise that you ll convert those people into crypto enthusiast but rest assured it's an argument you are never loosing again in your life.

1) The basics of bitcoin and blockchain by Antony Lewis:
The book begins with a history of money, the prevalent banking system, different forms of money/currencies and how payment works establishing the intermediate system of payments against which bitcoin stands to compete. 
It then dives into cryptography including topics like private/public keys, hash functions, digital signatures and introduces you to every crypto jargon you will come across. Further it frames the idea of blockchain, what they are, the issues that they are trying to solve, problems that require solution and the weaknesses inherent to a blockchain.

2) The Internet of Money by Andreas M. Antonopoulos:
It is a collection of talks that the author gave and which can easily be found online but in case you are someone who prefers to read then the author has transposed all his speeches into this book. His take on scaling of Bitcoin network is particularly interesting and aims to thwart all the controversy regarding it. Linking his YouTube video on that topic. Would recommend to check his other vids before deciding to buy the book. The material is freely available online.
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=bFOFqNKKns0&amp;feature=youtu.be

3) Charting and Technical Analysis  by Fred McAllen:
Charting and T.A for beginners, the author simplifies the concepts clearly and concisely making it a quick and easy read for the beginners. It's a bear market anyways, maybe a good time to invest learning few basics."

CryptoCurrency,"Popular Opinions I Disagree as a 3rd world Economics Student Edit: had to republish because the title was wrong

Brief intro: I'm a 3rd world country economics student a from Argentina. I write mainly about inflation and it's problems. Everyday I do research about a certain topic and publish the results at the subreddit, usually a good exchange of ideas comes at the comments. I do this both to share knowledge/create good content and to earn moons (they are a significant boost to my income). Yesterday u/feyd27 said that I should write about topic that are controversial in the sub but I agree with, so here I go (at the expense of potencial loses in moons). 

I'm completely open to changing my mind, please try to do so in the comments.

1.Tether ticking bomb is not exploding in the short term. Yes, tether is shaddy as hell (we can talk about the problems they have), yes they are iliquid, but as long as there is not a ""bank rush"" where everyone wants to convert USDT into dollars there is no problem, with very little cash banks are liquid too. Tether only had to make small interventions to push the value back to a dollar when it fell to 94 cents (yes, in the long term it will explode)

2.You don't can't time the market, but DCA everyday is not a perfect strategy. I have been to crypto since january. DCA on the way up from the bull run, cashed out at 56K because the analyst I follow showed his strategy showed the bull run was probably over. (I can make a post on the strategy with the graphs and indicators, explaining each). I didn't make a huge sum of money (like 100U$D) but that's like half a wage were I live. No, I couldn't sell the top, but at least I was liquid and now I can buy more BTC to hold for long term.
So DCA on bear market: great. Consider taking profits at bull to buy cheaper when bears come.

3.A loss is NOT a loss only when you sell. You can hold a rugpull, a pointless project, a scam etc and it's price will never recover, most crypto projects have and will fail long term, this happens in every industry, something better, cheaper comes and flips you. Just as Bitcoin will/has flipped the dollar.

4.Leverage is a tool, it's neither good nor bad. I only used 1-2x leverage when I traded, sometimes 1.5 (using x2 and adding cash). My profits rose a little compared to when I didn't use leverage. Yes, using leverage above 10x seems suicidal for me, but there are scalpers who make money, so who knows. Most definitely for the average Joe this is not a good strategy.

5.The bull run is over. The same indicator that showed weakness at the weekly timeframe is now showing weakness in the monthly timeframe. The other times it did this was when the last 2 bull runs were over. A bear market followed. When this happened almost every month the price fell below the previous month for at least 6 months. I hate to be pessimistic but sometimes it's better to be realistic. It was a nice ride! I really, really hope I'm wrong in this one. Also I wish it isn't over because we haven't hit the legendary 69k landmark. Just kidding, maybe next time.

Well, those are my unpopular opinions, please try to change my mind/convince me in the comments. Hope you all have a great monday!

CryptoCurrency,"Binance and regulation I’ve been hearing that Binance is being probed by regulators here in the US. I first heard about this on Unchained (a podcast about crypto news). Could an event like happened with Tik Tok happen to Binance? Because if the US is not sufficiently happy with how Binance is handling their US operations then they could just “tik tok it” (I.e. order they to partner and sell to US based companies like Coinbase). 

Honestly, I might agree with regulatory action anyway. They don’t answer my support tickets and adding my bank account continues to be a hassle. So I just turn to Coinbase Pro.

Don’t get me wrong, I don’t wish harm to Binance. Over $660 billion is traded over their platforms so I wouldn’t want that to go away. It’s amazing what they’ve done. But, more regularity clarity and better customer service from Binance US WOULD BE NICE"
CryptoCurrency,"Crypto is slowly changing my life Hi all!
Just want to start by saying MUCH WOW! 
what an awesome community; completely in love with crypto, the people developing the technology and the community surrounding it.
I started GPU mining in January and put some of my profits into Doge. Was lucky enough to cash out enough to buy 2 HNT miners (Bobcat 300) that are on their way.
I've also invested in a 5700XT (for games and mining when its not in use).
I've recently starting using a visa from crypto.com which is super awesome and makes crypto a lot more useable in day to day life.
It's been really amazing getting into this, doing a little day trading for fun with like...tiny amounts of doge to learn, seeing BTC balances build while GPU mining, anticipating my IOT devices.
Seriously an amazing space.
My friends are starting to get into it as well, we're kinda working together on the IOT devices and it's just awesome.
Feeling the love, seeing the results and looking forward to where this can go! 
Honestly a huge change.
I'm a pretty dedicated FIRE EFT guy; for me, crypto is a closed financial system separate from my regular income etc.
I won't put anything in - only working with the stuff I mine. With that said, I'm already seeing crypto accelerate my personal financial goals and it's slowly starting to change my life for the better!

(I can make a post on the strategy with the graphs and indicators, explaining each). I didn't make a huge sum of money (like 100U$D) but that's like half a wage were I live. No, I couldn't sell the top, but at least I was liquid and now I can buy more BTC to hold for long term.
So DCA on bear market: great. Consider taking profits at bull to buy cheaper when bears come.

3.A loss is NOT a loss only when you sell. You can hold a rugpull, a pointless project, a scam etc and it's price will never recover, most crypto projects have and will fail long term, this happens in every industry, something better, cheaper comes and flips you. Just as Bitcoin will/has flipped the dollar.

4.Leverage is a tool, it's neither good nor bad. I only used 1-2x leverage when I traded, sometimes 1.5 (using x2 and adding cash). My profits rose a little compared to when I didn't use leverage. Yes, using leverage above 10x seems suicidal for me, but there are scalpers who make money, so who knows. Most definitely for the average Joe this is not a good strategy.

5.The bull run is over. The same indicator that showed weakness at the weekly timeframe is now showing weakness in the monthly timeframe. The other times it did this was when the last 2 bull runs were over. A bear market followed. When this happened almost every month the price fell below the previous month for at least 6 months. I hate to be pessimistic but sometimes it's better to be realistic. It was a nice ride! I really, really hope I'm wrong in this one. Also I wish it isn't over because we haven't hit the legendary 69k landmark. Just kidding, maybe next time.

Well, those are my unpopular opinions, please try to change my mind/convince me in the comments. Hope you all have a great monday!

Extra note: sorry for my english, please correct me if I have grammar mistakes so I can learn!"
CryptoCurrency,"What are the best project below IDO-price? I'll start The bearmarket is definetely a place to pick up small gems. Since cryptomoonshots has turned into a scammers heaven, there are few places to discuss the actual gems that due to the cyclical hype settling down, are waaaay below a fair price. 

Para or Paralink is in my opinion a quite overlooked gem that had its launch during the start of the bear market and has since fallen way below the IDO price of 0.045 and sits at around 0.0012 right now. It is developing a real product, which is a multichain Oracle mostly based on Polkadot. It already has quite a lot of partnerships with for instance Polygon and backing, but mostly due to a rocky launch and a bear market it has been bleeding. I of course own a chunk and is willing to listen to anything that says its not a sound investment, but I do believe there a true gems out there"
CryptoCurrency,Not another dip its a small crash stock market doing the same. I bought in May and have been DCA since and am still down over 50%. A couple weeks ago I stopped buying to DCA to watch the crypto market as it slowly goes down with no end in sight and I think we will continue on this trajectory. Its hard not to buy when some of my coins are now at a third of the price but got tired of the downward trend. So for now I am just hodling what I have and accumulating fiat. I did buy a small amount of ALGO last night to watch it drop another 5 % which confirmed i should stick to my hodl and accumulate fiat strategy for now as the pain continues. Still love the technology and future of crypto.  The stock market also crashing today due to new pandemic fears wondering if that is affecting crypto also.
CryptoCurrency,"Big Media Corporations vs The Others… I love how crypto articles from big media corporations are 90% negative to scare people to sell and independent crypto writers are always optimistic.

Conclusion:

1/ Large media companies work for Wall Street, governments, and big banks to keep the little ones little. 

2/ The optimistic crypto writers are with the little ones."
CryptoCurrency,"If the gov wants to regulate crypto here is the easiest way they could do it without ticking off half of us So in mainstream trading we have exchanges and brokerage firms. The brokerage firm acts as a middleman for traders. Discount brokerage firms is the ones we are seeing where there is no commission fee and I can see this start being a norm in crypto.

Anyways, it's impossible to tie crypto to the normal exchanges because they only operate given times of the day and given days of the week. So this needs to be a 24/7 exchange backed by the gov (there could be several around the world). Basically, the gov needs to make 2 types.

1. Regulated
2. Unregulated

Regulated crypto will be listed on this exchange. Now it can be listed on all other places. But regulated crypto is safer because it has to meet given rules, you know for 100% what is going on (no more this SEC going after your coin giving if it's on that exchange). The only risk when it comes to that is just like anything on the stock market where if a company does something bad, then that might cause the gov to go after them.

In order for regulated crypto to work there would need to be 100% black and white rules like what is in the normal stock market.  And like normal exchanges, the gov has the power to do the same things with things on that exchange.

Then there is unregulated. This is higher risk because you don't know how the gov is going to go after things. Like a SEC vs XRP thing can happen with them. I'm not saying the SEC would win, I'm saying there is just a risk. And note this doesn't just apply to the USA. Say if EU did something like this you will know what is on the official exchange is regulated and what isn't isn't regulated.

&amp;#x200B;

With both you should be able to still buy it on any place you do now. But this opens the door to most firms being extremely open to at least letting us trade any crypto on the regulated exchange. This meaning those who are worried about the FUD the news is putting out will know that this is safe since these coins are gov tested and the exchange is gov approved (so no more of this Binance US customer service BS). And this means we will see a lot more new money coming into the crypto space.

&amp;#x200B;

The one thing that should be noted is I can see the gov playing with words like what is a firm. This making it where Binance is a firm and they could pull rules saying that firms aren't allowed to buy from anything but on regulated exchanges. IDK how to get the gov to not do stupid things like that."
CryptoCurrency,"Dogecoin I get it Dogecoin is a meme coin and the vast majority of this sub likes to take every opportunity to shit on this coin hence shitcoin. But couldn't it be possible that there is place for a meme coin like Doge and that it is here to stay? For years it has been laughed at and for good reasons. It's part of the meme the persona of the coin. So dislikers and likers both like to make fun of it. But isn't that exactly what this coin brings to the table. Crypto is pretty serious business as it should be. But a coin that isn't as tight and is more lighthearted could very well be a welcome addition to the crypto sphere.

I'm not here to shill this coin. Don't buy it I would even say. From what it looks like the market is heading bear. Just trying to give some perspective on the (well earned) place of this coin in the crypto market (in a somewhat hostile environment for this coin)"
CryptoCurrency,"Grayscale Unveils DeFi Fund Linked to New CoinDesk Index  

Grayscale, the largest cryptocurrency investment manager, said Monday it has started a fund focused on decentralized finance (DeFi) tokens, based on a new DeFi-specific index produced by CoinDesk’s TradeBlock division. 

The companies, both subsidiaries of CoinDesk parent Digital Currency Group (DCG), wrote in a joint press release the Grayscale DeFi Fund provides “exposure to a selection of industry-leading DeFi protocols through a market-capitalization weighted portfolio.” The idea is that investors can allocate money toward DeFi without having to buy the tokens directly. 

DeFi, which consists of blockchain-based software protocols designed for the trading and lending of cryptocurrencies, is one of the fastest-growing segments of the digital-asset industry. The amount of collateral locked into the protocols has increased 19-fold over the past year to [about $50 billion](https://defipulse.com/), and prices for many of the platforms’ associated tokens have soared. 

“Based on the user adoption that we’re seeing around DeFi and DeFi protocols, we do think the future of this area is bright,” Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein said in an interview Monday on CoinDesk TV’s [First Mover](https://www.coindesk.com/tv/first-mover) program.

The fund is only open to “eligible individual and institutional accredited investors,” according to the press release. Grayscale said it “intends to attempt to have shares of this new product quoted on a secondary market” but added that “there is no guarantee this will be successful.” 

The CoinDesk DeFi Index is a new product from TradeBlock, one of the first firms to develop an index for professional investors to track [bitcoin](https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin) when it launched the [XBX Index](https://tradeblock.com/markets/index/xbx) in 2014. CoinDesk announced its [purchase](https://www.coindesk.com/coindesk-acquires-tradeblock-adding-indexes-and-pricing-to-news-events-offerings) of TradeBlock for an undisclosed sum in January.

The new index joins a growing list of offerings designed to help investors track prices for DeFi tokens and invest in them. Last month, the technology firm Amun [launched](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/06/25/2253105/0/en/Amun-Launches-Two-New-index-Tokens-To-Simplify-Access-To-The-Ethereum-DeFi-Ecosystem.html) two new crypto token products, the DeFi Index Token and DeFi Momentum Index.    

The cryptocurrency data firm Messari has a dedicated screening tool tracking 164 DeFi tokens. The average price of the tokens is up 395% this year, versus 8.3% for bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market value, and 160% for No. 2 [ether](https://www.coindesk.com/price/ethereum).  

According to the press release, the CoinDesk DeFi index aims to provide a “broad-based, benchmark representation of DeFi protocols,” with assets [weighted](https://tradeblock.com/markets/dfx/) by their market capitalization.

As of July 1, 2021, the CoinDesk DeFi Index consisted of the following assets, with their market-capitalization-based weightings:

* [Uniswap](https://www.coindesk.com/price/uniswap) (UNI), 49.95%
* [Aave](https://www.coindesk.com/price/aave) (AAVE), 10.25%
* Compound (COMP), 8.38%
* Curve (CRV), 7.44%
* [MakerDAO](https://www.coindesk.com/price/maker) (MKR), 6.49%
* SushiSwap (SUSHI), 4.83%
* Synthetix (SNX), 4.43%
* [Yearn Finance](https://www.coindesk.com/price/yearn-finance) (YFI), 3.31%
* UMA Protocol (UMA), 2.93%
* Bancor Network Token (BNT), 2.00%

CryptoCurrency,"Lump sum or DCA? DCA is a popular strategy on this sub, and while I agree that it is definitely a solid strategy and usually safer than lump sum investing...

I read an article that stated :

&gt; The Lump Sum Investing (LSI), as explained, saw Shitcoin Ninja assuming to invest $10,000 in bitcoin at one go while the DCA strategy showed him putting the same amount into the cryptocurrency but across the span of nine years. The experiment resulted in a win for the lump sum, which beat DCA 67.9 percent of the time. The strategy made profits 60.8 percent of the time in recent datasets. 

What strategy do you use and why? And was it the right decision in the end?"
CryptoCurrency,"How does interest on stablecoin actually work? A lot of services are offering 5/10/12 % 'interest' on stable coin.

If we assume stable coins are backed by something (as in FIAT or other crypto), then how does the interest part work?

Are these interest rates coming from staking (and if so how does it work?) or is it something else like lending to other users?

I am thinking of platforms like YouHodler or Nexo.

Sorry if this is a dumb question. I'm thinking about investing some money into these platform which seem to me safer than actual crypto (at least in the short term) and am wondering there's a catch I haven't seen yet about these services."
CryptoCurrency,"Governments mixed behavier against CRYPTOES. I live in Iran and I wanted to show you mixed signals of Iran Governmet in regards of Cryptoes.

first I must mention that Iran is currently is under USA and Europe sanctions, (we dont want to talk about politics, so just its economies hardship fo Iran) so transfering fiat US Dollars is very hard for Iran, so Iran must trade in other currencies or cryptoes.

Iran main reason to mine and use cryptoes is to curve USA sanction but there are some problems which Iran government is facing.
one of problems with BTC is power outages, with old electericity powerplants, and huge amount of power needed for minig there are country wide outages which make all Iranian angry so to calm down these masses they shout down crypto mining farms( most of them are privete not Government owned), most of news about these farming are small farming owned by individuals. (they had never shown that they destroyed mining computers in state media)
Even Iran government put rewards for selling out these small farming, but there are government farming facilities which are untouched.
Then regime next move and politics is to own all cryptoes market and has full control on it so Crypto exchanges are in way so they crack down exchanges inside Iran. ( only one major exchange has already been shout down others are working well and it is strange.)
On the other hand, they pass a law to legalize cryptoes. after that they licensed bunch of government owned farm to legalized their farming. so the remaing farms are now without any problem can farm. 

All in all the main objective of Iran regime is curve sanction and for doing it they want to own all cryptoes activities in Iran, so they hunt and ban private cryptoes farming or exchanges and allow their owned farming to work instead.

These are some headlines from Iran government about cryptoes:

1- 14.01.2021, Iranian-Chinese bitcoin farm shut amid power outages.
2- 12 Mar 2021, Bitcoin backlash: Iran cracks down on crypto exchanges.
3- Jul 3, 2021, New Bill to Ban Crypto Payments in Iran, Support Mining and Regulate Exchange.
4- July 07, 2021, New Iranian bill to support Bitcoin mining and ban crypto payments.
5- Jun 5, 2021, Iran weighs crypto currencies law that can boost state revenue.
6- Jun 26, 2021, Iran Counts 30 Crypto Mining Farms Licensed to Mint Digital Currencies."
CryptoCurrency,"What I learned from 2-3 years paper trade bot experiment I'm an amateur coder and I made two paper trade bots, working on them over the course of 2-3 years. I went quite deep and success was varying. I'll eventually upload the second one, but here's what I learned so far. 

There are two styles: 1) TA-focused single asset non-margin and 2) portfolio rebalance style. The first I'm probably permanently abandoning, and the second I will experiment more with. I might upload the rebalance once I learn github. Also if you're selling and reinvesting hundreds of times a year you might end up with ridiculous taxes, but a few dozen trades seems okay.

**\-\-TA-Focused Single Asset\-\-**
Abandoned route. This was based on 30min candlesticks and was not consistently profitable. I also included 1day candlesticks, Fear and Greed Index, average Bitcoin blockchain transactions, all which supplemental data in addition to the 30min. The main problem I found was that market conditions changed faster than my ability to test. From the Barts of last year, to bull run, to now. That's a fair amount of change every few months. Data analysts could probably make something to analyze shit in a faster way.

Indicators used included Directional Movement, Choppiness Index, Volume Oscillator, FRAMA. TA is pretty controversial for this type of short term trading, so I figured going deeper into the rabbit hole was the way to go. I also went with a signal count + signal strength approach. For example, DI and CI might give a buy signal and 1day candlestick data gives signal strength. If signal count and signal strength are both high enough, it buys.

Experimented with shorts for a bit too, but no thanks. I also experimented with manual day trading to see if I could learn something for the bot. BAD IDEA.

Note: incrediblecharts.com has good info on indicators with formulas and all. The DI formula is incomplete though.

**\-\-Rebalance with Secondary TA\-\-**
This is currently running with two modes: dump and noDump. Both are about 5-6% better than pure holding (instance started in late March '21, **Starting**: $1000. **Bot**:$912, **Hodl**:$858). Dump mode was created during the Barts of last year, when the chart would look like Bart Simpson. When a sharp drop in price was detected it dumps the entire asset and rebuys when it looks okay.

It uses a stable coin reserve as the last asset in the portfolio. Each asset is examined one by one to see if it requires a trade. If signaled it buys from the stable coin reserve or sells into the stable coin reserve. Imo this is better than a true rebalance where it rebalances the whole fucking portfolio if only one thing is unusually volatile.

Selling/buying is considered at 0.3% deviation in portfolio makeup. So if Bitcoin was 10% of your portfolio, and it goes up 30%, then it sells. If MATIC were 5% of your portfolio then it would need to go up 60% to sell. This is deliberate because smaller cap coins are more volatile. It's configured to rebalance based on price relative to the moving average (specifically FRAMA, because I already coded in the formula so why not). TA still has a place imo, but in this case it's quite secondary.

A paper bot of this type is not very hard so I encourage you to try if interested. Emphasis on **paper trade**. Binance API is more convenient for back data than Kraken. Kraken only gives 720 entries per candlestick call (so 2 weeks of 30min candlesticks, &gt;2 years for 1day candlesticks).

**\-\-Conclusions and Next Project\-\-**
It's hard to take the plunge into this with real money and the market changes fast. Even the second method can be improved with better data analysis imo. Also pure hodl is hard to beat at the moment, though that might change.

My next project is a simpler DCA in and DCA out simulation inspired by Benjamin Cowen's videos on his Risk Metric. Probably something more accessible like RSI based."
CryptoCurrency,"What coins/tokens with strong fundamentals are you targeting during this dip? We know BTC and ETH will withstand the dips better than alts, but has this dip allowed/enticed you to buy into something different? Don't get me wrong, I have bought BTC and ETH during this prolonged bleeding crab. I am comfortable buying those because they are staples and don't bleed as hard in dips.

But have any of you used this opportunity to buy into something different that you have had your eye on or thought was interesting? Or maybe just using this time to average down on stuff with a higher average cost?

For me, I bought into DOT for the first time. Polkadot's ability to do cross-blockchain transfers for any type of data or asset while aiming to achieve high levels of security and scalability seemed very interesting to me. 

Have also used this time to average down on my higher average priced bags that I still believe will be important in the crypto space (such as LINK).

CryptoCurrency,"Art Cult Seeking Global Domination, how? Hello,

art cult leader here seeking some theoretical guidance. So let's say I've amassed a collective of talented and up and coming artists hell bent on making the world weirder. Here's what I'm thinking, tell me if this is stupid.

As part of our cult initiation program, we put candidates through a crypto literacy program. Get them setup with wallets, tips on safely storing, and how to transact . A portion of each transaction goes into a sort of shared crypto investment account. We use smart contracts to pay out a percentage of any growth automatically (each participant paid a relative % based on how much they've put into the pot) when it hits a certain percentage of growth. Basically like rewards on a credit card, except there's no limits on number of payouts.

There's two reasons I like this concept. 1: It sort of codifies our ethos of ""We all do better when we all do better"" and 2: It essentially makes us our own bank without adding any operational overhead.

Idk, crazy? Possible? Thanks."
CryptoCurrency,"I get (partially) paid in BTC, here is my opinion after two months of getting paid. So in the Netherlands you can work at a Pizza firm. Domino's Pizzas. They allow you to partially get paid in BTC. So i did this, and now my opinion,  you may not like it. I didn't really like getting paid in BTC, and i told Them to stop the BTC payments and Just to give me euro's. Its not very profitable at all. First of all they use a really bad conversion rate, so you are getting not a lot of BTC. Its better to buy it with the money you have yourself. Second thing, the fees are bad and i had to Pay those fees. So i was getting even less BTC. So imo getting paid in crypto isnt worth it at all,  BTC is ofcourse one of the worst to get paid in since theres coins with way lower fees. Also one thing, with the value of your salary that's going up and down like crazy its definitely not possible to get paid 100% in crypto since if it crashes you cannot cover your expenses.

CryptoCurrency,"Best long term store of value Many people, like Michael Saylor, who are bullish on bitcoin make some strong arguments in its favor as a long term store of value. While I agree with most of them, I don't quite understand why bitcoin couldn't simply fall out of favor for another store of value type crypto, with the same pros but less of the perceived  cons (e.g: a ""green bitcoin"").  
Kind of like the beginning of the internet. It would have been easy to make the case that Altavista was far superior to paper encyclopedias, but that was not enough for altavista to remain THE search engine.

CryptoCurrency,"""You are only down if you sell"" Wait a minute... I thought this sub didn't believe in fiat? So you always hear the hodlers saying 'you're only down if you sell' but these are the same people who tell you fiat is fake money and crypto is the real deal.

So why does the value of your crypto not matter until you flip it into your proclaimed clown currency? What could possibly be the point of alternating between comments of 'don't lose till you sell' and 'fiat is bunk' all day?  It's because they're lying to you. They want you to hold and not rock they're market. They want you to think that no matter what, more crypto is the answer, because their bags are bigger than yours and they're not afraid to sell at a profit.

CryptoCurrency,"A newbies guide to Moons. Pls help Hi all, I'm a reasonably new member to this community and I enjoy and appreciate all of the guidance and info that you all share on the daily. One thing I am still unsure of however, is how the moons operate on this platform. Any help would be much appreciated!

TLDR: how tf do moons operate."
CryptoCurrency,"Today looks like a pretty red day. Chances are, tomorrow will be green again. People will pretend it's the first day in ages. Because I am a salty dude, I looked into it just to prove to you that they're wrong. Since the crash/ major dip/ call it what you want two months ago today, the market mostly moved sideways, not going up or down a ton - at least not for longer periods. Bitcoin has rarely left the 30k-40k range (which is big, sure, but still), other coins also moved within specific ranges.

For some reason though, people seem to have lost their memories in this time. Every time the market turns green after a single red day, hundreds of comments in the daily thread are something like ""is that.... green? I can't believe it, I haven't seen green in months!""

Well. For some reason this bugs me.

It is, of course, nonsense. I looked at the 1 day candles on Binance. Just to be clear, they are green if the respective coin moved up in the 24 hour interval, and red if it moved down. It doesn't matter how much. So this is not really a great indicator of which direction the market moves for a longer period of time (because, sure, on a single green day it might move up as much as it went down in 3 red days before that), but for how often it goes up and down in a specific time frame.

Not including today, Bitcoin had green candles on 29 days, red candles on 31. Almost exactly every second day is green. The longest red period was 5 days in a row, the longest green period 3 days.

*""but what about alts? sure, BTC did okay, but alts got murdered since then and there barely have been green days!!""*

Well, not really. I looked at the rest of the top 10 (excluding stable coins), 

ETH 30/30 (green/red)  
BCH 29/31  
BNB, ADA, DOT and UNI 28/32  
XRP 27/33  
LTC 25/35   
DOGE 23/37

So most of them had roughly 50% green days, and even DOGE, which performed worst, had close to 40%. Which means it is never surprising to see a green day. I am not saying we are in a bull market. I am not saying we are in a bear market. I have no idea what will happen. But don't pretend you haven't seen green in months. Thank you!"
CryptoCurrency,"Tip - You Don’t Have to Buy Every Dip Most likely you’re on this sub because you believe in crypto and therefore have bought a bunch of dips the last month.  That said, you do not need to feel obligated to buy every dip.  Crypto will go up, it will go down, it will go sideways.  Great coins will struggle and shitcoins will go “to the moon” only for both to reverse course hard.  These things happen.

If you have bought enough to be happy should a grand reversal of fortune happen then hold.  Either tomorrow will bring that grand reversal and you missed out on one day of a sale, or it won’t and the opportunity will be there to buy tomorrow, next week, next year or somewhere way down the line.

There have been a lot of crypto sales the last 2 months, but if you ignored all of them you’d be way ahead of those who didn’t.  If you did buy in then it’s ok to let things simmer for a while.  There is no rush to get in on a sale that has been ongoing for 2 months."
CryptoCurrency,"Carbonswap and Energy Web Chain  

Hello everyone,

I've been doing a bit of research about Energy Web Chain and about their first Dex that was implemented: Carbonswap.

I will share the information I've gathered so far, and I am curious to see what the community thinks about it.

I believe these two projects really do have strong fundamentals.

Energy Web Chain was co-founded by Rocky Mountain Institute and Grid Singularity.

Rocky Mountain Institute:

\&gt;https://www.energyweb.org/about/history/

Grid Singularity founded by Gavin Wood. Co-founder of Ethereum, and creator of Polkadot and Kusama.

\&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavin\_Wood

The Energy Web Chain works as a public chain with Proof of Authority Consensus.

\&gt;https://energyweb.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/EWF/pages/717881446/Proof+of+Authority+Consensus

The Validators are big Energy Companies.

\&gt;https://validators.energyweb.org/

Allows for greater scaling than Ethereum since it already accounts that millions/billions of devices will use the chain frequently.

These are all the energy companies already part of the energy web chain ecosystem that will implement the blockchain use.

\-just to name a few:

EDF, General Electric, Volkswagen, Vodafone, Total, Shell, ptt group, Siemens.

\&gt;https://www.energyweb.org/work-with-us/our-affiliate-ecosystem/

Real use case implementation is the tracking of emissions on a global scale:

Also Staking is coming for EWT. Right now it is being tested on the Volta network, but will deploy in the short term.

EWT tokenomics:

CURRENT TOTAL SUPPLY: 58,217,123 Increasing to 100M maximum supply over 10 years.

ENERGY WEB TEAM:(14,093,276)

FOUNDING ORGANIZATIONS:(10,000,000) Locked until June 2021.

COMMUNITY FUND:(4,061,709)Increasing over 10 years.

CIRCULATING SUPPLY:39,273,083

Now let's get to the interesting part.

Other use cases involve the selling of Carbon Credits. This would be done through a dex.

The first dex to deploy on EWC is Carbonswap, which has been working together with the EWC team in the last months.

The native token of the Dex is the SUSU and will have decarbonizing function in the crypto both nft's and tokens with EnergyWeb Zero.

Tokenomics:

\-Hard cap: 300 million

 Never planned to be reached, plus also has a burn function, but that will be seen in the future if it's necessary to use.

\-the fees are 1\^e-9 Gwei 

\-there is already a bridge to Ethereum and to BSC

\-Erc20 version of the token present

\-pool on uniswap eth-susu present

\-nft marketplace incoming, which will also have pooling and fractionalizing energy attribute certificates.

\-lending and borrowing platform incoming

\-custom farm and custom stakes incoming

\-it will become a DAO in Q3

CryptoCurrency,"Short DCA guide during these times First off, I'm not a financial advisor and this is just my opinion.

So right now we have no idea if we are in a Wyckoff, if we were and broke out of it, if we are now in a bear (down) market, or what. But it is obvious for a while now we are flat lining and it's staying a path. Here is a quick chart I made (note the channel in the chart)

[https://www.tradingview.com/x/ADloVv9T](https://www.tradingview.com/x/ADloVv9T)

This shows a possible method for BTC to get to $20k, but at the current rate it will take all the way towards oct for that to happen. IMO because it's that far out it most likely won't happen and chances are if we hit $30k the pattern will change. But that isn't the point of this post.

Because we are in uncertain time IMO DCA is the right move here.

&amp;#x200B;

For those who don't know what DCA is. Lets say you want to buy $1000 worth of BTC. Instead of buying it all at once and risking the thing going down even more which would cause a big lost. You can simply do it 1 of 2 ways.

1. You could break the $1k up and say every day or every week at the same time you will buy. So lets say you split it up into 10 days. Then for $100 every day you will buy BTC at whatever price it is selling at. Even if the price does go down this works out because it averages the cost between all the buys and that is your base price.
2. You could break it up by %. So lets say you broke the $1k by 10%, then this means for every % BTC drops you put in another $100. This can be done with basic tools on many exchanges so it will automatically do this. You would just have to setup each buy manually and let the tool do it's thing. Same as above, your base price will reflect the average between them all.

The advantage of 2 IMO is it could easily go up after a given point and this would mean instead of increasing the base price, you kept it low. The down side is the amount of BTC is lower so if there is a moment that it does skyrocket then you lose out on that.

&amp;#x200B;

SIDE NOTE: Something I'm doing during this time is looking into using grid bots."

CryptoCurrency,"Bull case for Bitcoin summary, by Glassnode Net Entity growth remains positive as fewer entities are destroyed, and more are created. This resembles a 'dollar cost average' style accumulation environment.

Exchanges have seen net outflows after an extended period of inflows since mid-May.

Miners are in net accumulation suggesting sell pressure due to the Great migration is being mitigated or offset by accumulation by profitable miners.

Long-term holders and bull market HODLers appear unshaken by volatility and lower prices. The volume of coins held in illiquid state continues to grow, and the potential supply squeeze is coming from a much higher base than the 2018-19 bear. This demonstrates the remarkable conviction of BTC holders to weather extreme volatility.

CryptoCurrency,"Market cap questions So I’m new ish to the space and now seeing how the market cap of crypto as a whole is down 50% from the ATH what does this mean for crypto? The top 10 are down 50% in value roughly from their ATH as well, is this a coincidence? Is it fair to assume that when market caps hit ATH again that the values will at least double too? Is there anything else the dropping market cap means that I’m missing?"

CryptoCurrency,"FTX.US ACH suddenly not giving instant deposits I joined [FTX.US](https://FTX.US) about two months ago.  I have made several small deposits since joining. Usually $100 at a time.  The total was about $1400.  Well under their tiers that require more scrutiny.  However, last week, I suddenly couldn't deposit money via ACH like I had done previously.  I contacted support and they requested ID verification requiring me to send them a picture of my drivers license and a picture of myself.  This seemed weird because, again, I'm well below their tiers for KYC.  But I did it anyways.  I received confirmation that my ACH account was now approved once again. 

However, even with that approval, my deposit is taking SO LONG.  I'm waiting on my fourth business day for a deposit.  I contacted them again and asked them if this was the new norm.  They told me with a positive account history, the deposit wait times will be shorter and shorter. 

But I don't have a negative account history!  

I'm so frustrated with FTX right now.  I was just wondering if this is just me or if this is happening ot others. 

Thanks!"
CryptoCurrency,"Found a gem (I think) for my Moonshot Monday, need some thoughts on it? Hi all,

Help!

I've found a token that I think is a hidden gem but it's been really slow in uptake....I'm trying to understand why as it seems like a really solid project with a brilliant Dev team.....

WifeCoin (I know, don't laugh:) is the token I'm talking about. It's a fairly new depreciative token that utilises tokenomics where 4% of all transactions are redistributed to holders and 1% is burned.

It started out with 100T supply and half of this was burned on launch.

It has a really solid doxxed dev team and they supply AMA's via Youtube etc and are approachable on Linkedin.

Only 1453 holders as of this moment and it's dirt cheap right now too.

They have multiple developments in the works such as (Wife) swapping, staking and yield farming. 

I thought that this would fly (have to admit that I loved the idea) but I just can't see why it's stalling at the moment. Maybe it's the name but that's part of the reason that I thought it would do well....doesn't everyone have a Wife/sister/daughter or niece that would like some crypto in their lives?

Oh and they are currently running a competition on their website ([Wifecoin.finance](https://Wifecoin.finance)) for €1750.00 worth.

CryptoCurrency,"The term ""wallet"" I think the term wallet used for your ""stored"" cryptocurrency completely disregards the underlying technology. I like how some people refer to wallet applications, which helps a little, but the point this stands. A cryptocurrency address is not the same as a wallet, or bank account in traditional finance. 

I can see the point in having a relatable term to make it easier to transition into, but it just leads a lot of new people in crypto to misunderstand ""where"" their crypto is. I don't know if a more ""technically correct"" term would help new people understand crypto better, or just make it harder to get into. In that case, call it whatever you want, easier adoption is always better.

Please leave suggestions for better terms that are more inline with the technology itself :)) Have a nice day"
CryptoCurrency,Legitimate NFT giveaways? I have been pretty intrigued by NFTs but have never found them so intriguing that I would be willing to put any actual money into them. That’s why I have been browsing around for any way to get free NFTs or find giveaways where they can be won/earned. How do people find legit NFT giveaways or methods to acquiring free NFTs? I looked on r/NFT but there isn’t much to go off of there for this kind of stuff. I also saw the Space Jam NFT giveaway which would have been awesome to partake in but I did not find out about it until it was too late. Is there a reputable source for finding legit NFT giveaways?
CryptoCurrency,"The sound of shitcoin Hello crypto, my old friend
I've come to invest in you again
Because the bear market is coming 
My ETH fell 15% while I was napping
And the tokens that were shilled in my brain
Still remain
Within the sound of shitcoins

Through pancakeswap I walked alone
Narrow streets of my DeFi home
I Invested in Safemoon ponzi
Held my coins with the Shib army
Then my eyes were stabbed by the flash of my PC screen
My dollars missing 
And heard the sound of my girlfriends boyfriend crying

And in the r/cryptocurrency I saw
3,2 million members, maybe more
People shitposting without speaking
People FUDing without listening
People sharing shills and moon farming unpaired
But no one dared
Disturb the sound of poopcoins

""Fools"", said I, ""You do not know
My shitcoin like a cancer grows
10% slippage to go through
Financial advice that will snipe you""
But my shitpost, like silent raindrops fell
And echoed
In the wells of Reddit"

CryptoCurrency,"With all the red now, let's talk about Staking! Algo and Yldy making your coin work for you. Let me say this first, this is about building more coins over a long term. If you're looking to make a quick buck this not it.

So I've been messing around with Algo and the Yldy no loss lottery and I gotta say, I'm digging it.

First, you got the Algo on Algorand Wallet with passive Staking building a reward pool that cashes out anytime you make a transaction to or from your account. 

Then, you got YLDY with the Yieldy no loss lottery where you stake Algo for weekly lottery tickets and gain YLDY rewards daily. You can choose to claim, or continue to stake the YLDY to accumulate from the prize pools. After the weekly, keeping your Algo staked continues into the next drawing.

So with a split of Algo passive staked on the Algorand wallet and Algo staked on the Yieldy generating YLDY and letting the rewards compound, you are generating the most coins you can daily.

If I'm wrong about any of this please say something. I found it to be a fun way to passively generate coin and stop freaking out about price fluctuations.

CryptoCurrency,"Why burning coins does not increase the price So there is a common misconception in crypto - people expect prices to go high when projects burn their tokens - this rarely happens. Also many scamcoins are based on this fact.

However price is a simple dynamic from buys and sells. The current price just represents how high buyers would go and how low sellers would go. The available supply can shift this as well as many other psychological factors.

When the creators of a token burn it to hell, they take the coins from their own supply - A supply which was in most cases never available to the market, so this process is nearly independent from the price - it could only have an effect as the news itself.

The most important and ironic detail is, that if this supply would have hit the market (creators taking profits), the price would go down as the available supply would rise. So theses coins are not burnt to increase the price, actually they need to be burned in order for the price NOT to go down."
CryptoCurrency,"Should I DCA every month, every week, or every day? So I started investing in crypto in April, and the most I've had to spend is about 200 bucks each month (the coming months due to life I might afford more, or way less), and I've just been buying bitcoin for that amount on Binance each month and then exchanged to whatever else I want from there.

But with how volatile crypto is I've been wondering if maybe I've been better served transfering the monthly amount to Binance and doling it out once a week/day, or would the amount be too small to make it worth it? 50 bucks a week seems reasonable but I'm guessing 7 bucks a day could be a bit silly."

I'm kinda new to crypto but I'm smart enough not to panic sell or to FOMO at big prices, I always buy the dip but that's the problem: I'm not scared of Bitcoin (or good, big alts) crashing, i believe in the fundamentals, Bitcoin is here to stay, I'm scared of a big pump so I couldn't buy low anymore.

As soon as I saw Bitcoin go to 30500$ I went all-in with all Fiat left on my kraken account because I was scared of missing the dip and having to pay like 34000$.

If I had to take a guess I would say Tether might not be in the top 100 by then if they finally collapse for not having a 1:1 backing of the dollar. This could result in many more falling and I would be curious to see if Binance specifically survives that fall. Though Binance is huge. Sometimes the bigger they are, the harder they fall.

Another guess would have to be ADA. If they can’t meet their promises I assume their following will eventually fade.

So tell me, of the coins you see most talked about on this sub, which do you think will be irrelevant in 20 years?"

Hope it will be useful for some of you. I cut the text a bit and added ""read more"" just to understand what's more interesting to have a chance to write even more useful content next time. So let's start from DOGE first.

# What’s Dogecoin, and How does it Work?

The cryptocurrency, which originated as a joke, has surpassed all others in terms of hype over the past year. Ironically, it seems to be quite sensitive to jokes, as evidenced by Ilon Musk’s humorous comments. The Dogecoin cryptocurrency was created in December 2013 by Billy Marcus, a programmer, and former IBM engineer. At the time, Bitcoin was getting a very bad reputation for involvement in black market transactions on the darknet, and Marcus wanted to create an alternative that had nothing to do with such dubious problems. The cryptocurrency’s name came from a meme and the image of a dog is used in the images it is illustrated with.

Dogecoin is based on Litecoin, and its... [read more!](https://guarda.com/blog/dogecoin-vs-shiba-inu/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=cryptocurrency-SHIB-DOGE)

# What’s Shiba Inu Token, and How does it Work?

SHIB is the name of a cryptocurrency token called Shiba Inu. It is a token whose logo depicts the face of the same Shiba Inu dog that uses Dogecoin and, as its developers claim, aims to “replicate Dogecoin’s success in turning a joke into a joke. machine for making money”.Shiba Inu (SHIB), nicknamed the DOGECOIN KILLER, has been released in line with the ERC-20 standard of the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain. SHIB allows users to have billions or even trillions of tokens.

While very little is known about Shiba-Inu, its white paper (dubbed “woofpaper” by its team) explains that it consists of 3 tokens (two are already in... [read more!](https://guarda.com/blog/dogecoin-vs-shiba-inu/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=cryptocurrency-SHIB-DOGE)

# So, What’s the Difference?

Despite this, events show us that SHIB is trying very hard to stand out and show that it can have real use and be profitable without relying solely on memes. So, as far as advanced, the value of Dogecoin has grown incredibly in the past year, especially thanks to the support of celebrities like Ilon Musk and the acceptance of it by the community, which has made it one of the most popular tokens, which is now ranked nth.

CryptoCurrency,"Hope for the best A new cryptocurrency bill is gonna discussed in indian parliament today. lets hope for the best


What is Cryptocurrency and Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill, 2021?
•The Cryptocurrency and Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill, 2021, also known as the Crypto Bill, was a new bill on cryptocurrencies that suggested a ban on private cryptocurrencies in India and facilitate the creation of an official digital currency.

Though the RBI wants a ban on cryptocurrency, the government is not in the favour of an outright ban on cryptocurrency. Rather, the government is more likely to treat cryptocurrencies as a tradeable asset class with a market that can be traded and invested, as per government officials. The relative volatility of cryptocurrencies is among many concerns within the government."

CryptoCurrency,"Estimating the Interconnectedness of Crypto and Non-Crypto Economies Hello,

I'm trying to do some research, partially for myself and partially for an Executive MBA to try and sort out a few things that I think you all may be able to help me out with.  I'm personally interested in the market dynamics.

*Full Disclosure: As far as being a Crypto person, I invested like $75 in BTC, LTC and DOGE via Celery in 2015 and have used that to watch the market.  After a series of moves it's now all 1.6 ETH locked up in Staking.  I'm not a heavy investor/trader but do see potential future value after these initial swings/shocks settle down.*

*Bonus: My DOGE would have been worth \~$85K at its peak with a basis price of 23.99 net fees from celery.  I sold it in 2017 for $1,400ish and still consider it one of the most lucrative investments I've ever made on a percentage basis.*

I have some questions for data and potential input from the crowd:

* Does anyone have a good estimate of how many real dollars are in the market?  
   * Theoretical values are high but we have some risk via Tether that are in the legal spotlight
   * Outside of Stablecoins, how much actual cash is held on exchanges?
   * What other reservoirs are there?
* Who are the overlapping points where crypto-volatility may force sell-offs in the normie finance world?  Yes publicly traded crypto firms are going to get their faces ripped off in the case of a big event, but I'm focused on less easily predicted ones.
   * Are High Frequency Traders/Low Latency Traders the greatest risk here?
   * Are there hedge funds with a high risk of arbitrage divergence based on some unforeseeable fall out of crypto?

CryptoCurrency,"An alternative to Binance Hi to all cryptocurrency heads out there! 

I feel like Binance became the exchange of this bull run. Most of the newcomers' go-to place to by crypto is Binance. Binance is the name that comes up the most, and some say it is the most developed crypto service. 

As an alternative, I am a huge [crypto.com](https://crypto.com) fan. I think they offer a prety good service and they are developing fast. I have been with them since 2017. I consider it as the second best crypto app/exchange/service/card after Binance (In some areas it might even be better imo).

When I do a search in google for the ""best binance alternatives"", top10 lists come up. Amongst these lists I didnt find one where [crypto.com](https://crypto.com) is included. Why is that? Is [crypto.com](https://crypto.com) still so unknown? Anybody else thinks [crypto.com](https://crypto.com) should be on those lists?"
CryptoCurrency,"How can new tokens on any block chain avoid over accumulation or pump and dump schemes? Say you'd like to create a token for a software platform / product you're developing. The more I think about crypto, the more it seems to me like a perfect instrument for creating markets and utilising the atomic immutable transfers in order to withheld the contracts between the demand and supply sides on the platform.

How could you easily distribute the token among your potential and new customers?

Any ideas/examples?

Idea 1 is to peg the price of a token to some utility declaring its value on day 1 of the release of the token.

Airdrops onnthe other hand just seem scammy and could be easily exploitable."

CryptoCurrency,"When to stop hodling? I see many people who intend to hodl to the end.  Of course, if you do that then you eventually die and never use your crypto.  And I understand the desire to keep hodling because the ATH’s this year were difficult to imagine in the past.  If you sold your crypto ot the previous ATH, you would miss out on this huge high.  So a couple questions.  Do you plan on leaving all your crypto to someone else after you die, and not intend to touch it yourself?  What would be the circumstance that would prompt you to sell?  High price?  Financial difficulty?  Retirement? If you had multiple currencies, which would you choose to sell first and why?"

CryptoCurrency,"Rug pulled asset questions Last night I stumbled soon a post about a tax question on a rug pull where someone said that they wanted to claim a loss and to do so they would sell their tokens to a friend for a dollar or so. My question is not that but that of I still have a big bag of a token that was rug pulled completely with no value and I keep it in my wallet to remind myself to never do something dumb like that again. My concern is that since I bought it for x amount and even though it’s worth nothing does the government still ask me to claim x amount on my taxes as I’m still in possession of these useless tokens? 
The token was 4ch5 “4chan500” I did t think I’d fall into a meme scheme but it seemed fun, glad I learned how to Dex coins however lesson learned and I’ll never trust in a “community” with out doing my dd for at least a couple/few weeks before investing.

I often leave a couple comments on new posts just to go through my comments again later to see it all on -1 to -3. 

Yes I understand you guys wanna cash in big on Moons and you don’t want anyone else to cut into your slice. 
But how sad is it that you’re envious of everyone else in this community and downvote legit and/or helpful content just to press your agenda? 

I really wish we would just treat Moons for what they were supposed to be: A nice small reward for people creating great content. If you want this concept to actually succeed you have to play by the rules and not be greedy hogs and learn to deal with the fact that other people also get a piece of the monthly distribution. 

I mean, ever since Moons were introduced, you could already notice a steep decline in upvotes, almost like people refused to acknowledge great content due to the fact that they don’t want their Moons bag to take a hit.

CryptoCurrency,"One more application of crypto - cascading, infinite leverage! Volatile times are coming and with those we should expect some more nice wreckage. But watching plebs get wrecked on 100x leverage from their bybit-shilled reference link is not enough for a good show, but worry not, crypto as all things can improve that to a true spectacle. 

All you need is to be able to tokenize positions - so be a dev at Mirror, SNX or Binance. So you opened a 3x long position - that's 3x leverage. But since you have all the great tools you can lock this position and issue tokens representing those positions - let's call it BTCBULL. This is all fine and dandy and now you have a 3x leveraged token. But that won't wreck anyone nearly fast enough for good entertainment, so let's put them on an exchange that allows .. you guessed it, leverage trading!

So you 3x long your BTCBULL position which should result in nice x9 leverage. So you have that position ... but also have all the tools to tokenize positions... so let's do it, now you have a tokenized 3x long position on a BTCBULL (3x leverage) token. So let's tokenize this x9 position into BTCPERMABULL and release for trading.

Long it. 

Tokenize position.

Long.

... (x however much you want)

Do it 10 times and you end up with every degen trader's dream - 3486784401x leverage, tokenized into one single token - BIGDICKBTCPERMABULL

If you keep doing it, in the end you get a token that gets wrecked in infinitesimally short amount of time, but to be discrete let's say you can get wrecked in Planck time. Each underlying, compounding position liquidates the next, basically creating a cascading avalanche of wreckage almost instantly bringing your token to 0. But if you opened it and the price was going in just the right direction, for that one incredibly small split second, just for that one small point in time,

You were rich."
CryptoCurrency,"People's opinions about CCs, Germany, Austria, and Switzerland 2021 In May this year, the consulting company BearingPoint made a survey about the state of cryptocurrency acceptance in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland. 

Almost 90% of the contestants have heard of cryptocurrencies. This is a huge increase from only 5% in 2016. Today, 25% know how CCs work.

About 14% of people have invested in cryptocurrencies. The most common access point is crypto brokers, followed by CC exchanges, and the least common way is through banks.

In the future, an additional 17% will potentially invest in CCs. But a 10% does not know how to do so.

As obstacles for future investments are seen: high volatility (46%), doubts about safekeeping (40%), and regulatory uncertainties (38%).

Regarding CCs as an assets class, over 30% deem them a suitable form of investment. Over 80% see gold as a suitable asset, 65% see stocks favorably, and about 58% see fiat money as a good investment. 

Survey method: online survey, target group surveyed: population aged 18 and over, sample size n = 4,112.

Matic is down like everything else and I could sell for a significant tax break with capital loss, then buy some discounted BTC/ETH. Thoughts?"
CryptoCurrency,"No one seems to be answering this question, about pool mining, am I just overthinking things? TL;DR When mining in a pool you receive shares that are displayed as decimal faction of a token, when that decimal fraction reaches 1.0 is it actually worth the same as a real token?  for example Etherium seems to be fluctuating around $2000 per token, if I mine in a pool and I get to 1.0 ETH in my account is that worth the approx. $2000 that an ACTUAL token is worth?  

So I got interested in Crypto, mostly in Etherium, I saw that it was worth something around $2000, after doing some research I found out that with my GPU I could mine about 1 Etherium a month (give or take a week or so) I thought ""That's almost what make at my day job, doubling my income would be nice.""  so I learned a bit more, watched some Youtube videos that made it look really easy and then I thought ""It can't be that easy can it?  I can just Make double money?  With no real effort?""  of course not.  everyone keeps saying ""I'm making $150 dollars a day passive income."" or some other similar statement.  I don't care, I want to earn a token and sell that token for the value of that token.  If Etherium is worth $2000 (I know right now its around $1800, but it fluctuates and I'm just averaging it... kinda) I want to mine an Etherium token and then sell that token for $2000.  but nobody is talking about how to do that which is making me think it's not normally done.

So I then found out that all this easy mining stuff is actually mining through a pool, so a whole lot people are all working together to mine the currency and the pool takes home the pot, then splits it among everyone, equally or by contribution depending on the pool I guess.  I don't really understand all the payment methods and what exactly they are doing (please don't try to tell me, I will find a tutorial that I understand eventually, but for now its a lot of complex jargon to me).  but I DO understand that a pool divvies out shares, and a share is represented by a decimal fraction OF a token, e.g. 0.23487 ETH which is approximately 2/10 of one Etherium.  but these shares are officially worth nothing I'm told, they are just a numerical representation for accounting purposes.  so if my 2/10 of an Etherium are worth nothing then when I get to 1.0 Etherium is it suddenly worth something?  As I understand it I do not own an Etherium token, I own a bajillion bits of a bajillion tokens that are basically worthless.  like if I shaved a small bit of a bunch of one 1oz gold coins until I eventually had an once of gold shavings, sure it's 1oz of gold, but it's not gold bullion.  SO, do I like exchange my bajillion bits for an ACTUAL token?  I do know that tokens have codes associated with each individual one so that it can be confirmed that that token is the only one of that token and it is owned specifically by a certain person or company.  Is my 1.0 ETH in my mining pool actually worth the same as a ""Real"" Etherium Token?  can I sell that 1.0 ETH for (approx.) $2000?  that is my question and I cannot seem to find anyone on the internet willing to answer it.  (I literally made a reddit account just for this, because I CANT RELY ON GOOGLE OR YOUTUBE OR ANYONE ELSE APPARENTLY!).  help me reddit, you're my only hope."

CryptoCurrency,"Stop worrying about day to day fluctuation and go enjoy your summer! Let me start by telling you, back in 2016 I jumped in the weedstock frenzy, I bought Canopy, Metrum Aphria and some other stocks only to experience a slow bleed that brought me down to 80% in matter of WEEKS.
It was tough, but I held on, brought my average down via dollar cost averaging and held my positions. I kept doing DD on the companies I invested in to keep track and to remind me why I invested in the first place and also to keep my confidence up. What I did to keep my mind off things, first I uninstalled Yahoo finance and stopped looking at charts every 10 minutes, found hobbies to do etc. Months passed by and then tide slowly turned around, my averages started getting out of minuses to go in the green, and in a matter of a few years my -80% averages were 500% 800% 1000% in the green. I was glad I held into what I believed in. Sure there were a few crashes and slow bleeds after that, but in the end the most important thing was that I didn't panic, kept doing my researches and stayed confident in my investments.


We are coming out of a year and half of pandemic, lock downs etc. Borders are opening up again, Tourism and travelling is slowly starting back again,  people have been staying home, working from home, stacking money on the side and investing in crypto/stock market, we experienced a big crash in feb/march 2020 only to recover everything in just a few months and markets/Crypto hitting ALL TIMES HIGH.
What we are experiencing is part of a normal cycle,  first people are starting to live again, travelling, going out etc then we have the ""summer lull"" or the go o'le saying ""sell in may and go away"".
Nothing has fundamentaly change, all the good news about crypto is still happening, countries are adopting the technologies, more and more businesses are starting to accept crypto, more people are becoming aware of cryptocurrency.
Shit even my 62 year old conservator mom invested in a etherum fund. 

Anyways I won't go on forever but all I can say is if you are in this for the long run stop worrying, go out enjoy life, have a drink, go see your friends and family. Take your mind out of it and enjoy, money is not everything. Take care of yourself and your love ones while we get thru this bump in the road. The future is Bright.

CryptoCurrency,"Does the blockchain keep getting infinitely larger? I wanted to try running a Bitcoin node on my personal computer but was surprised by its huge download size. The entire blockchain is around 350 Gb right now (more or less)? That alone would take 2-3 days to download on my home internet and eat up almost my entire monthly data. Going into the future, will the blockchain just keep getting indefinitely bigger? I read somewhere that there was a way to shave off old useless blocks but this has never happened yet afaik. Wouldn't that make it easier for more people to run nodes on their personal computers, which I believe contributes to Bitcoin's decentralization and longetivity? What do y'all think?"
CryptoCurrency,"I never realized how addictive staking was I've always been skeptical of staking, because all it does is create inflation and drive the price of individual coins down, which creates a net real gain of 0%. 

The only way to make big gains is by finding coins that have huge potential to go up in value, regardless of the ability to stake or not. 

I still think this is true purely mathematically. 

But two days ago, I moved my ALGO into the official wallet, and I noticed that the staking rewards update every few seconds... I was absolutely hooked.

It was like playing an RPG game or an idle game and just slowly watching your character gain more exp and level up and get stronger and richer.

CryptoCurrency,"Collective Efficacy &amp; Social Cohesion: This sub makes me feel like im in a nightclub It’s like an awkward dance at the club.

Dance a bit revel in some banter,  
Leave with both parties enriched

Respect the dance for all you lurkers reading, don’t be afraid to join in. We all win by engaging with each other.

This idea of loving each other as if we are in a sweaty nightclub, also brought me to the second point i am about to make.

I wanted to introduce a concept to you guys called ""collective Efficacy"", defined as  the ability of members of a community to control the behavior of individuals and groups in the community.

&gt;""Communities with high levels of social ties, where neighbours look out for each other have lower rates of crime and a higher rate of safety. Those communities that experience high levels of population decline, as well as those where most of the residents belong to social groups that possess a smaller share of the resources available in society, are less likely to develop a sufficient level of collective efficacy to significantly prevent or reduce crime. Since developing mutual trust and cooperation with neighbors requires time, those communities where individuals are more likely to move out (transient population) have lower levels of collective efficacy. In communities more seriously affected by residential instability, social bonds between residents are weaker, meaning that they will be less likely to cooperate in monitoring the behavior of others""

Similarly I believe the future of this sub relies on our conscious efforts to increase the collective efficacy of this sub. I wont list out the myriad of problems that I think are with this sub, but alot of them can be discouraged if we look out for each other.I do hope that we as neighbours can deepen our ties despite the anonymity of the internet.  


 We should keep an eye out for spammers, bots and genuinely engage in discussion, be a good example to the new people, try to remember the names of people you interact with, you will see them again, look out for one and other, be merry, be resolute and most of all do your part in cleaning up the litter.

CryptoCurrency,"It’s time we have a little talk Safemoon.

I’ll begin by saying I’m not here to “shill” nor promote Safemoon, nor will I ever. I believe if one wants to invest, they will do it on their own intuition. This, however, is meant to be an open discourse about the token (future coin) in itself.

Every single day, I scroll the r/cryptocurrency subreddit page and find countless comments about Safemoon accompanied by swarms of downvotes and tens if not hundreds of follow-on comments that say, essentially, nothing more than “scam”, “Ponzi”, “iT dOeSn’T hAvE aNy uTiLiTy”, etc. as well as people asking legitimate questions like: “Why or how exactly are you labeling SFM as this or that?” To which there are no helpful responses. Simply… “you tell me why it isn’t a scam.” 

So.

Where is the bar set for utility? People are so scared of change and adaptation; it might ruin their little pet project. Give me a break. The incredible thing about cryptocurrency is every project can live in the crypto ecosystem simultaneously.

Since your question (rhetorical) is “Why do you guys buy those?”, I’ll offer my answer: Safemoon.

I’ll be the first to admit that I my initial investment into Safemoon was purely hype driven. I’d never considered investing in cryptocurrency, figured I’d missed the boat, thought it was too complicated, a whole list of reasons. What got me was the noise, in multiple facets, people who aren’t crypto people. Not shillers, not paid promoters. I recall the moment exactly. I was watching Timthetetman’s twitch stream and his chat for weeks suggested buying Safemoon. He repeatedly said it was too difficult to buy, he was too dumb, etc. So I thought to myself.. hmm.. I’m not dumb, let me give it a try. In a matter of 20 or so minutes, I went from never having considered buying crypto to owning some Safemoon. Mind you, I still didn’t even know what it was.

This was right before the big bull push. Within a few days, I had almost 10x’d my investment. My mind was blown. “Holy crap?! Why haven’t I been in crypto for longer?? How could I have turned down these opportunities!?” We all know what happens next. The entire crypto market took a nosedive. (Important to note: at the time, I didn’t realize it was the entire market) I was still up, but by a small margin. This prompted me to become the biggest Safemoon fudder on Reddit. I had the infamous “How to make money in crypto” post outlining that all it took was to create a unique token that had catchy words, phrases, heavily market it, pump the price, sell, repeat. The repercussion of my actions was a swift ban from the Safemoon subreddit, obviously, and understandably.

Then something happened. I watched that week’s AMA. I joined the discord channel. I took a deep dive into researching the roadmap, it’s possible utility, it’s niche in the cryptocurrency marketplace. Since my research, I’ve more than 10x’d my initial investment and will continue to until I reach my goal bag size.

Why I’m bullish on Safemoon’s future and a few tidbits I feel can bring some conversation to the table:

1.	⁠Multi-chain bridge’s allowing utilization in just about every sector.
2.	⁠Wallet (currently in closed beta testing) said to have the best encryption/security on the market.
3.	⁠Exchange with tokenomic implementation, first of its kind in the crypto space, meaning if I hold ETH, Doge, BNB, etc I will receive reflections for holding that coin/token. (Read: a la stock market compounding interest as an auto staking mechanism without having to stake yourself) Also said to be able to process more than 3,000 simultaneous transactions.
4.	⁠Blockchain being built with hints that it could be based off the IOTA Tangle network (speculation, not outright confirmed as of yet) as opposed to your standard “blockchain”, meaning faster transaction times, stronger encryption, more reliable network, lower transaction fees.
5.	⁠Cold wallet release said to be end of summer this year. Earlier in the year, Ledger published a FUD article about Safemoon and the likes. What did the team do? Very next AMA said they’ve taken matters into their own hands and we’re building our own cold wallet as competition while also filing a lawsuit against Ledger.
6.	⁠Gambian project/Project Pheonix. Yeah yeah, I know. Same ole song and dance. “Everyone is trying to go to Africa”, “that’s just all hype and promise and no product”… I get it. The team has kept this one extremely close to chest and tight lipped. That’s why I’ve put it so far down on the list. It is extremely mysterious and secretive, likely by nature and NDA as the team is in talks with literal national governments. We’ll see how this one pans out. Color me… cautiously optimistic.
7.	⁠Debit card. The only reason I put this here is because the “market” wants to see a use case (ie a way to spend your crypto) and this is it. The debit card will be excluded from the notorious 10% tax, thus allowing it to be used in a transactional nature. This doesn’t mean anything to me personally as I (like I would imagine majority of the market, despite what you might say) have no intention on spending my crypto on pizza, crypto is an investment to me, not a utility. Alas, to each their own.
8.	⁠Thomas Smith. Papa has been in the crypto space since Bitcoin. He has stated countless times he was in the chats during the original Satoshi days and has been a student and steward of the game ever since. He turned down a multi-million dollar offer from XRP and took the keys to the Safemoon project instead. He is about as pure as it comes in the idea of what cryptocurrency should and was always intended to be. On top of this, Papa is absolutely incredible at what he does as a developer. If Safemoon is to succeed, aside from the community itself, it will be on the backs of Papa and his team.
9. Video game implementation, application. I’ll be honest, my gaming experience is essentially Fortnite, COD, and the occasional Pokémon for nostalgia purposes.  Because of this, I can’t really dive into the benefits of video game integration.

Those are a list of hard confirmations in the pipeline and personal sentiment. Other, speculative items on the agenda that have been alluded to but not outright confirmed or denied are satellite/telecom integrations, branching to other African/international countries/applications, NFT’s (and save me the “everyone is doing NFT’s” essay), and there are more I can’t think of off the top of my head. Again, speculative in nature. However, it seems with every speculative piece of information we’ve received from the team, most of it end up coming to fruition.

FUD and concerns I’ve combed through in just about every Safemoon post in the CC and CryptoMoonshots subs:

1.	⁠It’s a Ponzi scheme - Here’s a wake up call buttercup. Have you ever heard of.. wait for it.. investing? Maybe you’ve heard of Bitcoin. Or Microsoft. Or Amazon. Maybe Apple? Early investors will always reap the most reward no matter the product or company. $1,000 invested at Amazon’s IPO is worth ~$2.4m today whereas if you were to invest $1,000 today, you wouldn’t be able to buy one share. Does that make Amazon a Ponzi scheme because early adapters reap the most reward? $1,000 in Bitcoin at ATL of ~ $0.0008 would net you ~ $81B at ATH. I don’t have to do the math for you any longer to make my point that early investors benefit the most. That’s how the market works. With that being said, for the MLM aspect, I could buy 25B Safemoon right now and start earning more reflections than someone who bought 5B three months ago. So how does that play into the entire “Ponzi” game?

2.	⁠Rugpull - If I had a dollar for every comment I’ve read about “the Safemoon rugpull is coming and it’s gonna wreck so many innocent investors”… enough already. Seriously. In what world do you live in where a company with projects in the pipeline, a fully doxxed team, international government relations, etc is going to rugpull? Wouldn’t that have happened 4 months ago? It literally can’t. Liquidity is locked. And for those saying “yeah man they’re definitely gonna pull the rug when the liquidity unlocks in 4 years.” You literally can’t be serious and you look like a complete clown with suggestions like that. With all of that being said, two people on the core team have a stake in Safemoon: SafemoonDev and Hank our CTO. SafemoonDev (the creator of Safemoon) has stated that his wallet (deployer wallet) is used to fund the project. Read: pay employees, fund business expenses, etc. As for Hank’s wallet, who cares? Aside from these two, the community set up a donation wallet for our CBO Thomas who has stated he doesn’t own or want to own any as to not cloud his judgement and work ethic in a project he is passionate about. He has also stated he has zero intention of ever cashing out anything in the donation wallet.

3.	⁠All hype, no product. I don’t know what to say to this. Honestly. Safemoon is four months old. Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc maxies expect every single new token/coin to release a polished final product one week into their roadmap. That’s not how it works. Apple was around for 30 years before it ever released the iPhone in 2007. (Save the speech, I know Apple had other products well before that). Tesla was founded in 2003 and didn’t produce it’s first car until 2008 and now has a market cap of more than $600B, higher than every other car manufacturer combined.

4.	⁠Adoption. This one doesn’t make any sense. Just because YOU don’t want to buy Safemoon doesn’t mean people aren’t. With nearly 2.5 million holders, I’d hardly say people aren’t interested.

There’s so much unfounded hatred towards Safemoon. Reddit is an echo chamber of people drooling on themselves while typing hate messages on a forum because the hip and cool thing to do is hate on a company/project that is genuinely attempting to revolutionize the crypto space. You don’t see the Safemoon community in here pissing all over the Ethereum network or Bitcoin. Why must y’all do it to us?

Now that I’ve given entirely too much energy to put some of this FUD to rest, where have I gone wrong? Where have I been led astray? What have I missed? Any intuitive insight or outsider perspective from someone besides the crowd that just knowwws Safemoon is a scam?

Let’s talk!"

CryptoCurrency,"Ethereum Staking Options Hello, dear people, 

I'm interested in the most efficient ways and solutions to stake Ether as of now, Q3 2021 and I think this is a subject which would be interesting for many other people as well. 

My current situation - I'm able to provide the 32ETH required to run my own validator node, but I'm not sure the trouble to maintain it is worth it, so I'm looking for alternative solutions. Ideally, they wouldn't require a total lock of the ETH, but if locking it up would provide better yields for some reason, I might consider it. Besides, if there's an option to stake using my Ledger Nano and still maintain total control of the funds, that would be great. 

I've currently explored Kraken (they do require locking up and they maintain the ETH on their website), lido, which has a bit of a better yield and also guarda wallet, which seems as a very decent balance between all of the above. 

What other solutions might you suggest in this case? 

Thank you in advance!"
CryptoCurrency,"Least inexpensive way to sell into USD So I have plenty of different crypto in my Trustwallet and my question is, what is the best way to get the crypto out of the wallet and into USD for the least possible charges?

For example, I know changing, let's say Safemoon into USDC would take up some transaction fees including Safemoon's own inherent fees. And then I have to transfer out USDC to a crypto market that supports selling into USDC like Coinbase, Binance and Kraken, which is a hit of transfer fees and then finally sell the USDC on Coinbase, Binance or Kraken which in turn has more fees.

From my understanding, USDC is actually expensive for fees because it's on the Etherium network so maybe BNB is cheaper but then I hear Tron (Trx) is even cheaper. Right now  I think, from this example, Safemoon into Tron then send to Kraken and sell is the cheapest route. Thoughts? 🤔"

CryptoCurrency,"Bitcoin ETFs, Gemini security and tax-advantaged accounts So I am considering buying Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs inside a tax-sheltered account in order to not have to pay capital gains on any gains.  

The ETFs buy crypto and store it with Gemini.  Gemini's website says the have 200M worth of insurance, but they seem to have 10 Billion in digital assets.  This seems like very little protection for each individual investor.

I'm worried that as crypto ETFs gain in popularity, Gemini will have a bigger and bigger target painted on its back - how confident can we be in their ability to safeguard their crypto?

My other option is to sell some funds in my non-registered account to re-allocate to crypto and thus get hammered on capital gains twice: 1) when I sell now to re-allocate and 2) later whenever I choose to sell.

What do?  Go uninsured with Gemini for tax-free gains?  Or go with personal storage on my Ledger for extra security and pay the capital gains?"

First up, I would like to mention that majority of your bitcoin should be in a cold hardware wallet and NOT in the following methods which will earn you passive income. However, if you would like to earn some passive income using bitcoin/crypto currency and are accepting of the risks.  I made a [video](https://youtu.be/WrWIt71vlsU) explaining how to. I always wished to be able to live off my crypto and I have finally reached that point, I hope to be able to help you in your journey as well. If you like to read instead, then I have written a guide here. Nevertheless, please take good care of yourself in this current climate :)

 1. Lending Platforms 

Lending platforms are lending services that offer deposits and loans on both centralised and decentralised platforms. Essentially, as a crypto holder, you will deposit your crypto onto these platforms and earn an interest on those crypto funds that you deposited. It's pretty similar to how a bank works. These services will hold our crypto and lend it out in order to generate interest  and this interest is then paid back to us on a regular or even daily basis. With most lending platforms, you do not have to deposit your cryptocurrency for a fixed period of time, in fact you have access to your funds at any point in time should you require to utilise your crypto. In addition,  many of these platforms provide insurance to the funds that you deposit making it one of the safest ways to make passive income. To sum it up, the beauty of lending platforms are that they allow your money to compound daily with minimal risk whilst giving you 24/7 access to your crypto funds.  

 2. Staking Coins Coin staking is the action of staking your coins in order to help maintain the decentralised consensus on proof of stake blockchains. It's kind of like being a miner in a POW blockchain such as bitcoin. But in bitcoin - miners compete with their computing power, in proof of stake block chains - people compete with the amount of coins they stake. The more coins one stake, the higher the probability of being chosen to validate a node. When you stake a coin, you earn a a decent return of your coin in kind and you also help to secure the network of the coin you are bullish on. There are a number of things you have to consider: 

\- Wallet Support - Staking complexity - Duration of lockup  - Staking returns

 Different coins have different staking parameters. 

  3.Liquidity Mining/Yield Farming Liquidity mining It is the practice of supplying liquidity to a protocol which is then used in order to facilitate the decentralised exchange of different assets. The transaction fees exchange users pay in exchanging the two coins is then distributed among liquidity providers based on the proportion of liquidity they provide. Some examples of such DEXES are Uniswap and Sushiswap. However, the risk of liquidity mining is impermanent loss. Impermanent loss is the quantified opportunity cost of providing liquidity should one of the tokens become volatile in price.  For Yield Farming I recommend Yearn finance - an app which automates the process by sending your crypto currency to different platforms in order to earn the highest return possible. The risk is that your funds are being moved in yearn vaults and pools may be exploited."

CryptoCurrency,"How scammers are using you to get rich by sending you gifts I discovered the (wonderfull?) world of NFTs few months ago. In theory, every artist or developer can create and sell his assets. Additionally, many new games relying on the NFT system are emerging (Alien World, RPlanet, Colonize mars and more). 

But, the problem with NFTs it's that literally everyone can create his own asset. And I keep receiving in my wallet shitload of free NFTs everyday (from various artists, developers). It really looks like ""NFT spam' and It really reminds me my email box with hundred of spams everyday.

So, I wonder : What is the spammer's motive?  
In most of the marketplace, the creator of an NFT can put a 'collection fee', a fee that he gets whenever his NFT is sold. And this is how those scammers operate : 1) Create a huge amount of shitty NFT with the highest collection fee (15%) 2) Spam everyone with it 3) Hope that people will sell it for even 2 cents 4) get your 15% out of the sell 5) Repeat 6) Profit.

Helt Spårat is traced using IBM Food Trust, a blockchain-based solution that enables a safer, smarter and more sustainable food ecosystem by increasing transparency across [supply chains](https://www.ibm.com/blockchain/solutions/transparent-supply?utm_medium=OSocial&amp;utm_source=Blog&amp;utm_content=000026VK&amp;utm_term=10005803&amp;utm_id=Brewing-a-more-traceable-and-sustainable-beer-industry-with-blockchain-In-Text).   

The story of Helt Spårat spans roughly two years and takes you on a tour of Sweden in the form of interactions throughout the supply chain. Consumers have a complete view of production, which began on 22 April 2019, when farmer Wilhelm Aschan sowed the grain at his farm, to when the beer was bottled on 13 March 2021 at the brewery. 

Taste Profile (according to their website):

* Kellerbier
* 5.2% Alcohol
* Unfiltered
* Tastes of fresh herbs and lemongrass

CryptoCurrency,"Grayscale has essentially put 3.1% (and increasing) of the BTC market in a walled garden. While GBTC is being traded, it reduces BTC activity. Those who were celebrating Grayscale for pumping the market on the run up can thank it for the recent dump and stagnation. In addition to the main point in the title, I just want to clarify a couple of persistent misconceptions about Grayscale's products, prompted by DataDash's video today that contained some errors. I've been publishing information about this to my twitter at CryptoniteClark over the last few months, but haven't been able to dispel the myths.

GBTC shares should not be confused with the BTC held in the GBTC Trust Fund. When GBTC accredited (ie wealthy) investors buy GBTC shares, Grayscale buys the same amount of BTC and adds it to the Fund.

When Accredited GBTC investors invest, they have to wait 6 months before they receive their GBTC shares. For example, the large amount of shares that were bought during the 10 days starting 13th January, which is reflected as a sharp increase on the [Bybit Holdings](https://www.bybt.com/Grayscale#Holdings) chart, are being [unlocked](https://www.bybt.com/Grayscale#Unlock) now.  It's not that those investors are likely to sell, necessarily, because they'd be selling at a loss due to the [Premium discount](https://www.bybt.com/Grayscale#Premium) of ~12% under the BTC price. However, the people who were considering buying BTC now may find the GBTC share price more attractive due to that same discount.  The amount of spot BTC being traded will be reduced as a consequence, which will continue until the Premium returns to a healthy positive (say, +10% rather than -12%).

Once GBTC shares have been unlocked, they can be traded without restriction with non-accredited investors.

The BTC in the GBTC Fund are **NEVER** sold, with the following exception.  It's clear from the [Bybit Flows](https://www.bybt.com/Grayscale#Flows) chart that there are small daily deductions of BTC from the Fund of about ~36BTC per day. This is the admin fee, which equates to about 1.5% per year (although, the published amount is 2%). Even if Grayscale doesn't manage to acquire another customer in the next 49.5  years ((650,773BTC / 36) / 365), it will still be paid its millions of dollars per day in admin fee. It's even higher if you add up all its crypto funds.

Although more trivial, the other drawback of Grayscale products for regular BTC traders is that the more it accumulates, the less accurate on-chain analytics will be."

CryptoCurrency,"Anyone else experience this? So I bought Matic on Coinbase. I opened a Metamask wallet, created Matic Mainnet in addition to the Ethereum Mainnet.

CryptoCurrency,"I don't know anything about Technical Analysis, but that's the least of my worries In a world where pumps and dumps, shills, news, celebrity influence and rumors predict and alter the market, depending on TA is essentially meaningless.

Sure, as a trader some of us always use it and it has helped us a lot to gain profits, even when the market is down.

But nowadays, crypto is much more complicated than that.

When Elon made Doge reach the heavens and beyond, nobody could predict it. Most people didn't know Cardano could almost hold still for one or two months after the reddening of the market. When the news of BNB token burning in the future came out, it went up, but when the tokens got burned the price actually fell.

In such a mindless, irrational and unpredictable market, I still believe holding is the best option, but mostly holding top useful coins.

Am I wrong? Is it wise to depend on TA in cryptosphere?"
CryptoCurrency,"Staking APYs are not APRs This may be common knowledge for many people here, but there is a significant difference between APR (annual percentage rate) and APY (annual percentage yield). APR does not take into account compounding interest, APY does. So when you see a figure for estimated APY when staking, this is the estimated yield one year from today, compound interest included.

So say you are calculating how your balance will grow over time, if you apply the APY figure compounding on a daily or weekly basis, you’re actually double counting compound interest, as this is already built into the APY formula.

Not going to make a huge difference on small balances, but if you have a significant amount invested, it could really throw off your staking projections, especially if you’re trying to beat inflation rates in something like ADA or ATOM."

CryptoCurrency,"DeFi Tokens and General Safety regarding 'Genesis Dumps' Hi all.


Just wanted to share my story and a word of caution really on regards to why buying a lot of or perhaps going all in on a brand new DeFi platforms native token token, may not be the best idea. I've lost about 200 grand because of my choice, ile explain why.

For context I have been involved with cryptocurrency in some shape or form since around 2010 but really only started making actual monetary progress in 2015 where I rode the first Ethereum train into the DAO, watched it all split and hardfork and lost all my cash making the wrong decisions with DAO tokens, little did I know they would be later redeemable for ETH, my mistake.

Similarly in 2017 I experienced a similar situation where I absolutely killed it, this time with a few alt coins I was interested in, ended up with a lot more this time and things looked really good but as with many I lost a lot here too.


So I spent the next 3+ years DCAing my coins and ended up with a metric shitton of the ones I actually wanted. I started trading futures here too and smashed it, call it luck and deep obsession but I got out of it with a lot more than I bargained for.



Cool I'm nearly there after tax, just a waiting game now I have my bags ready to go.


Next I heard about the BalancedDAO DeFi platform on Icon network powered with ICX and moved my cash here to start yield farming the loan at stupidly high APR that has since levelled out as the new BALN token crashed endlessly from $70 to $14 over the next 30 days or so, during this time I sold all the BALN tokens I was farming as expected them to fall a lot, though by staking these newly minted tokens you can earn Network Fees from the platform. Don't get me wrong, I didn't get suckered in by the genesis APR rates, but I did pull in about $1600 a day for atleast the first week by taking loans out against ICX.

Based on this I always had it in my mind that I will sell them to death and then once they look to be cheap, ile go hard in and trade all my ICX for BALN and stake them, getting those tasty network fees.


When the time was right (IT WASNT) I went almost all in and purchased tons of these bad boy passive earning tokens at $14.50 as the inflation of 100K a day up to about 6 million tokens was due to halt to a crawl once the network fees were released not too soon afterwards. I'm thinking, finally now I can quit my job in maybe a year or two, now I can pay my small mortgage off once taxes are paid. This is what I've been looking for!!!!

I went so hard in to this I am amongst the top 40 wallets (was #10)


This token didn't stop falling, its still falling daily and its currently valued at about $1 and though I DID get 30% bump on my BALN stack from the first wave of fees, relative to what its all worth now it was not worth it at all. I'd say things were getting better but I've lost another 10 grand this week alone.

Mind you, I haven't sold and am receiving the fees so it's not a complete right off, its just that I worked hard for that money, its the same money I've been regurgitating since 2015, time and time again and my luck was finally at the end of its tether.


TLDR; Lost about $200K investing in a new DeFI platforms native token in its genesis inflation phase as thought the platform network fees would cover the loss from the falling price. It didn't, and it won't stop falling and now I probably need 1400% increase just to break even."
CryptoCurrency,"This is a pretty amzing use-case for blockchain technology and incentivized nodes: smart routing for data I was reading [this](https://medium.com/syntropynet/syntropy-starlink-testing-results-9263fd3f22f7) article here and was impressed. It's surprising that there isn't more talk of this here.

From the article itself

&gt;This smart-routing system is backed by our Distributed Autonomous Routing Protocol (DARP) technology. DARP nodes constantly share latency information, creating a global intelligence layer for internet pathways. DARP nodes relay network traffic when they provide a superior route versus the default public internet path...

&gt;.... Our community-run DARP network can consistently provide performance improvements. At the same time, our built-in end-to-end encryption can give every Starlink user increased privacy and peace of mind by default, with no performance degradation.

Some really good graphics/data in the article, too. It's definitely worth a look in my opinion if you or anyone you know is interested in privacy andor reducing lag."

I want to enable my Allowlisting Security, so I figured it's time to get a wallet so I can have at least one address listed but... I can't decide which one lol.

I narrowed my choices to the top 3 Trezor, Ledger, and SafePal. They all seem solid but I will only pick for my 1st. I'm leaning towards SafePal because it doesn't have Wifi and Bluetooth so less chances to be attached by those two.

CryptoCurrency,"It’s not about me anymore. It’s for my family. Like many, I was drawn into the wild world of Bitcoin for the promise of financial gains. After researching many other coins and projects, my curiosity turned into an obsession. After hopium-fueled dreams of becoming financially free fueled my millennial brain with coveted dopamine, I realized it’s not about me anymore.

It’s for my recently divorced father who’s stuck paying child support with no retirement. The company he worked at for 15 years folded and he’s left with nothing. It’s for my sister who’s in college for a PHD; student loans aren’t cheap. It’s for my unemployed mother, who’s lost in life. It’s for my future wife and kids who deserve a blessed life.

I’m not DCAing for my own selfish reasons anymore. Anytime I throw part of my paycheck at my beloved ETH, the old-but-gold BTC, the underdog ADA, or any other solid project that catches my eye, I’m now thinking of my family. It’s time to step up and beat the system for them. I’m not afraid of an impending bear market.

Through alcoholism, other addictions, and medical conditions, depression is easy to be be caught up in. I call myself the black sheep of my family. But maybe in 15-20 years, I won’t be. Maybe I’ll be able to retire my dad. Or pay off my sister’s student loans. Or offer support to my mother. Or buy a car for my future son.

Nothing but love and prayers for all the ETH hodlers, BTC adopters, ADA supporters, and even the DOGE fanatics hoping for another Musk tweet. (I’ll throw Safemoon in there too for whatever reason. But really, invest in something better.)

CryptoCurrency,"Unpopular opinion: Buying a falling knife is way better than buying at ATH prices. I don't really understand how people is more afraid to buy during corrections and dips than FOMOing in during ATH.

Arguably, the risk of buying at ATH is incredibly higher, since there's a room for a bigger downside, while if your buying a falling knife, your starting price point is incredibly lower. For example, right now.

Let's say you buy a BTC falling knife at 30k, and it dips further to 28k again. What's the risk? An 8% fall?

If we compare that to people buying alts at ATH, like ETH, XLM, DOT, ADA, MATIC or BNB, we've seen falls of more than 50% or 60% in every single one of these.

My invitation, which is not financial advice but instead a call to think about this with a cool head, is the following: If you FOMOed into crypto this year, and bought at or near ATH, right now is an amazing time to either buy at half prices and lower your entry prices through DCA, or alternatively, a great chance to buy a falling knife which is a much better decision risk-wise than FOMOing at ATH.

You know how the saying goes...

CryptoCurrency,"Repost: from 8 days ago **A Hard Truth**

The next 6 months are going to be a wake up call for a lot of people in crypto and meme stocks 

The last 12 years since the 2008 crash have been a hyper investment period. Almost all sectors at one point entered a bubble. Crypto, energy, technology, healthcare, EVs etc....

Unfortunately the FED broke the money system last year and the party may be coming to an end. Crypto has seen the biggest jump in history backed by literally FOMO and nothing else 

Everyone made money bud. It wasn't your genius strategy. It was literally the easiest time to make money in the market in human history 

While I don't 100% agree with M. Burry; he is right that a major BTC correction is coming. DCA isn't going to work when 90% of crypto goes to $0 

ETH and BTC and maybe a few might survive the mega crash but BTC is now proofing out to $12,500.00. On almost all major models. On chain data suggesting a fair value of $10,000.00 from $20,000.00 in May 

A relief  rally with a max cap of $56,000.00 is still possible but the only model that supports that is Wyckoff and nothing else 

The trigger may be a -10% correction in the NASDAQ

When shit like SPCE jumps 40% because the founder said I'm going to space. You know the market it fucked 

GME, AMC, DOGE and TSLA have been the biggest warming signs in 20 years

It doesn't mean that there won't be money to be made but it's just going to be way harder. No more 50x gains on Dog coins and 10x on ghost chains that have no use function 

ICP was worth $700 and MINA a $187. They  are now $30 and $1.20. With the bottom being around $2 and $0.50

We all just need to put in the work and stop with the HODL and DCA memes. A lot of people are going to get REKT and its time this sub takes responsibility and educates people about how near the cliff we are"

CryptoCurrency,"I don't get hardware wallets I am looking for a secure way to store my coins for many years. Apparently hardware wallets are the way to go for long term storage. But I don't understand what is so great about them.

As far as I understand there are three key components:

- Public Key
    - can be generated by Private Key
- Private Key
    - for signing transactions
- Seed Phrase
    - for recovery when Private Key is lost

The Internet tells me that a hardware wallet can store the Private key and sign transactions with it. It is protected by a pin code to prevent other people from using it. In case the hardware wallet is lost the Private Keys are lost too and I need to use the Seed Phrase to recover access to my wallet.

What I don't understand is why the above is so great. Why don't just grab two usb drives, encrypt them and store my Private Keys on drive A and my Seed Phrases on drive B? For the same 60+ Euro I can get a whole bunch of usb drives and store multiple back-ups in different places.

CryptoCurrency,"Pump 'n' Dump groups - you're doomed from the start. The super TL;DR here is ""Don't even bother""  

This isn't like gambling in the normal sense, the odds are so stacked against you it's almost past ""lottery winnings"" odds.

With Pump 'n' Dump groups, a lot of people don't realise the way they operate from the inside. But first, a discussion of how they look from the outside.  

Each Pump 'n' Dump group operates from the following premise:  

* Visible history of huge pumps that they lay claim to  
* Post history of members saying ""I made X profit!""  
* Locked or limited general chat (discord)  
* Timer for the next pump  
* Invite more members to be alerted to pumped coin sooner.  

So what happens is as a new shmuck, you join and you wait, they will announce that they will be performing a pump on an exchange (Binance) using a certain pair (BTC / USDT)  

The time comes and they say ""Coin is [DONK], buy now!""  

So you rush over to the [DONK/USDT] trading pair and you can see the price absolutely rocketing on the minute chart. You quickly market buy as much as you have in USDT and then wait to market sell.  

Maybe if you're *extremely* lucky, you make a small profit. But usually what happens is, the first minute candle is massive and green, and then these gigantic red candles come out of nowhere, decimating thousands of newbies positions on the way down and leaving thousands more as bagholders.  

**How does this happen?**  

To find that out, you need to look from the position of the owners and VIP's of the group.

* On the sly, buy [DONK] over the course of a few days or weeks to keep the daily volume as flat as possible and the price low.  
* Announce there will be an upcoming pump and encourage users to invite new people to find out what the pumped Coin is 10 seconds before the general public  
* Keep accumulating  
* On the day of the pump, add a sell limit order something like 300% above your initial buying average  
* Announce DONK to VIP's, who may get a 50-100% ROI, and then moments later announce DONK to the general public in the discord.  
* Sit and watch as your sell order is fulfilled with absolute ease.  
* Post in general chat about ""waiting for a second / third wave of pump"" to encourage people to hold on, while your VIP mates keep fleecing them.
* When the general chat is then filled with hundreds of people saying ""WTF? I've lost 80% in minutes?!"" remove their posts and mute the chat. Leave up anyone saying they made profit.
* Then wait for the next pump so another round of idiots can give you their hard-earned money.

And the fun part is? The owners of these PnD groups have multiple coins going at once, staggered out.  

How do I know this? I joined a PnD group out of curiosity at the start of the year. I put in literally a few quid to see what would happen and after the rug was pulled it became very clear how this would operate from an admin point of view.  


This is one of the areas of Crypto where I actually wouldn't mind some regulation. These groups have over 100,000 members easily and there's multiple of them. IMO, the perpetrators should receive heavy prison sentences as they are running gigantic scam operations."

Just compare the historical chart of the s&amp;p and bitcoin. Bitcoin seems to look like a leveraged S&amp;P trade. All altcoins are correlated to bitcoin so in other words the s&amp;p500 starting to look bearish is bad for crypto.
CryptoCurrency,"If market crashes in 1st quarter of 2022 As TA suggest that approx 4 year bull cycle of BTC which should end anywhere around 1st quarter of 2022, taking that into consideration I have a question to ask, is it wise spending Fiat on buying crypto right now or should I just accumulate more Fiat money for those intense dips later on ?
As my goal is not for trading but to Hodl long term so why hurry if crash is around the corner as TA have proved to be nearly right at least for bull cycle.
Why I am asking this is because I have recently started investing in crypto so I am in a dilemma hope you understand

CryptoCurrency,"Some things I learned which might help others xD Here are some tips I found :  
1. Don't try to time the market.  
2. If you plan to hold go to yield farms, start staking (they have really low / no risk).  
3. Invest what you can loose.  
4. Use decentralized wallets like metamask. 

5. Learn about different coins and never stop learning.

CryptoCurrency,"Is Crypto for the rich? I'm young and I know little. I try to put what I can understand of this situation. Being a 19 year old I tried to analyse how crypto can change the world or will it?

I know buying crypto early is a good long term investment and It may give incredible returns in the long run, but the rich will be able to buy more of them than others. Resulting in the rich becoming richer and widening the financial gap, won't it?


And the price of the coins are same for anyone be it a first world country with an average pay of,say, $30k or a country with average pay of just $20. 
So obviously it is affordable for the ones in the ""rich"" countries rather than the ones in the ""poor"" countries. A person doing the same job in America earns 6-7 times more than a person doing it in South East Asia. The American can therefore but 6-7 times more than an average Asian. 

So initially I thought crypto is a grand scheme that may bring the globe together and we'll have a common currency and no differences. But the truth is, we'll have the same differences but with a different and common name?"

The announcement comes just weeks after Scotland Yard confiscated £114 million in crypto, breaking the previous record.

https://news.bitcoin.com/police-set-new-uk-record-seizing-180-million-worth-of-cryptocurrency/

Law enforcement officials in the U.K. have announced the seizure of a record amount of cryptocurrency during an ongoing investigation into international money laundering. Detectives said they confiscated almost £180 million (close to $250 million) worth of crypto without providing more details about the type of coins and how they were seized.
“This is believed to be one of the largest seizures globally and tops the £114 million confiscation made by the Met on Thursday, 24 June,” the U.K.’s Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) remarked in a press release published on its website Tuesday morning."

So he calls me for help and within 5 minutes of sitting with him I've sent 12 LTC to a wallet, recieved a confirmation email on the purchase, and a shipping notification for when he can expect his order.

CryptoCurrency,"Is Bitcoin the safest and most reliable long-term investment? Preface: I'm no expert, financial advisor, moonboy or Elon musk follower. I just want to know everyone's opinion and learn.

Is Bitcoin the safest investment? I have setup a recurring buy for bitcoin for a while now, and it's the only coin that seems legitimately worth the investment because of how well it's keeping it's price and how vastly it can be used (apart from eth maybe, but don't have enough money to invest a reasonable amount in both, yet.). 

I've also invested much smaller amounts of money in altcoins.. such as fantom, helium, axie and more... But is it worth it? Their volatility seems much much higher, and definitely not as reliable or versatile as bitcoin.

Now, what do you people buy altcoins for? Hoping for a quick moonshot? You believe something in particular from their project and keep holding until it rises? Or is it all useless and bitcoin and ETH will be the only ones in the future that will be usable as an actual currency? 

Sorry if all of this sounds stupid, I'm no expert but I'm eager to learn."

This is a throwaway account for the purpose of recruiting research participants.

I'm a student at the University of Bristol in England and, for my MSc dissertation, I’m exploring how employees perceive blockchain technology and its future use within supply chains. As part of this, I’m looking to interview people whose jobs involve interacting with supply chains in some shape or form (so anyone who delivers, takes delivery of, or manages stock/raw materials; IT staff who manage stock systems; supply chain managers and senior managers who manage supply chain employees; and so on). 

It doesn’t matter if you have no idea what blockchain is, or if you’re a bona fide expert - I’m interested in your opinion.

The interview should take around 45 minutes to an hour to complete. Participant information will be provided beforehand, and all data will be handled in accordance with the University of Bristol ethics and GDPR policies. I'm more than happy to provide proof of authenticity upon request, in addition to my use of a university email address.

CryptoCurrency,"The Future of Scams in Crypto Everyday I read on reddit a case of someone that got scammed either by phishing, fake customer support, fake websites, or malware on their computer. The thing with crypto and decentralised services is that you are responsible for your mistakes, everything comes with a price.

But many wonder if there is a possibility that sometime in the future there will be a way to regulate it without renouncing to decentralisation. 

The amount of scams today is quite alarming, and is one of the main reasons why crypto mass adoption is not plausible as of today. The average internet user is not aware of how vulnerable they can become by just clicking on the wrong link, or the dangers of publishing enough information to draw a few scammers like a drop of blood in a pool of sharks. I'd say that 99% of these crimes go unpunished and the victims rarely, if ever, get their money back.

Will there ever be a way to reverse such transactions?

CryptoCurrency,"Future Trends in The NFT Space? My top 3 picks Our lives are becoming more and more virtual with every passing day. NFTs are game-changers due to the fact that they are one-of-a-kind, unhackable, and indivisible. They're about as safe as it gets in the digital world.  


With NFTs, a whole virtual reality can emerge, recognizing and associating things with their owners in a unique way. Against this background, a question that arises is what is the future of NFTs? What can we expect from the NFT space in the future? Here are some of my top picks that could be the future of NFTs  


1) Music: NFTs can be used in the music industry, where artists can tokenize their music. Kings of Leon, a famous rock band, launched their debut album as an NFT, ""When You See Yourself."" This could be the future of music wherein artists can create one-of-a-kind NFTs as well.  


2) Leverage: Leveraging ones NFTs to either earn yields or as a loan is something that is catching up in this space. Projects like [Drops](https://drops.co) allow users to leverage their NFT assets to obtain loans and earn yield, significantly reducing the opportunity cost of holding them long-term. NFTify is a simple p2p marketplace for collateralized NFT loans. It allows borrowers to put up assets for a loan and lenders to make offers to lend in return for interest.  


3) Tickets: With the Wizards' team owner Ted Leonsis looking at using NFTs for virtual tickets, we can expect this trend to catch up with other NBA teams like The Mavs as well. While non-fungible tokens remain misunderstood and confusing to many, a lot of boosters in the pro basketball world welcome a future where NFTs are the norm.  


NFTs pave the way for digital content creators, allowing them to achieve more and receive more from their creations. For creators, the future of potential ownership via NFT is promising.  
What do you think could be some of the future trends for NFTs?"

CryptoCurrency,"I’m investing with my dad’s money while he knows nothing about crypto, here’s a fun thing that happened. First of all, My dad asked me to invest his money into crypto, as I know a bit about it and I’m doing relatively well. He knows nothing about crypto, but trusts me and acknowledges the risks. I, in no way, persuaded him to invest in crypto.
Having said that, here’s what happened;

I downloaded a portfolio app on his phone so that he can track his crypto and sees what I’m doing. I naturally keep plenty of funds in a stablecoin (in this case usdt) so that I can buy potential dips etcetera.
After the first week he kept calling me on my workphone, I picked up during an important meeting, fearing something bad had happened, and when I did he said the most adorable boomer thing: ‘I have been tracking the coin usdt you bought this last week, and it is not doing much, it’s not fluctuating at all, but I’m expecting a rise soon, what do you think?!’

I found it absolutely adorable and dumb at the same time. I explained everything to him and we had a good laugh in the end.

What I’m left with is a messy portfolio. By messy I don’t mean thoughtless. The majority of what I have is crypto I believe in and money I can afford to lose. 

The mess is just the assortment of balances too small to convert or move to a wallet, off an exchange, etc. 

So I just let it sit there, for better or for worse, because to do otherwise wouldn’t make much sense to me. It’s the minimum amount threshold basically preventing me from cleaning up after myself. 

But what if there was an app or program or coin - or whatever the correct word is - that allows novices like me to consolidate our crumbs? Then those crumbs are converted to philanthropic causes or maybe free BTC starter packs for people who would otherwise never consider learning about or using crypto? 

And then they start to fuck up in all the same ways I did, producing more crumbs that just get recycled and consolidated? 

I guess it doesn’t matter for people with so much money they can constantly consolidate to what they want and ignore the crumb producing factors, but idk it seems like a nice idea to me."

CryptoCurrency,"➡️ Good, Bad, Ugly of Yield Farming | Econteric.com  

Today, we are talking about the agrarian society 2.0. I guess history really does repeat itself in new forms!

Today, we are talking about yield farming, the modern day agriculture. Instead of harvesting crops, we are harvesting tokens.

Yield farming is part of token distribution and user acquisition. It's basically mining tokens by using the protocol (i.e. executing trade). It's attractive because it's possible to get a 100% APY. But it comes with risks.

# 1. Projects Using Yield Farming

* **Sythetix**: issuing SNX tokens to liquidity provider. It worked since sETH tokens make up 1/3 of uniswap's liquidity pool
* **Curve Finance**: issue native tokens like SNX, REN, BAL, CRV to liquidity providers
* **Compound**: The total assets under Compound has surpassed Maker, the top DeFi app. It is the primary market for a decentralised money market. Daily COMP tokens are issued to users based on trading volume. It worked since 1 billion new assets entered the Compound market
* **Balancer**: Weekly BAL tokens are issued to users based on trading volume. Before the distribution, volume had generally been under $2 million. Since the distribution, it has generally been around $4 million. But on Sunday, June 28, volume shot up to $14 million.

# 2. Good Bad Ugly

\[**Good**\] **It works.** This native token is an **incentive for liquidity providers**. That is exactly what exchange platforms are doing with their native tokens too, by incentivising market makers. It works for users because they are rewarded with extra tokens. It works of the platform because they are **onboarding new users**.

\[**Good**\] **Projects** like these are way **beyond** the stage of **just a white paper**. We have a working product that can be used and this is the first step towards getting a user base.

\[**Bad**\] This is **still a short-term incentive that is not sustainable**. What happens when the hype of trading is gone? Or when transaction fees are too expensive and it makes no economic sense to trade? Or when tokens are all given out?

\[**Bad**\] So far, it seems like the **yield is a zero-sum game**. If you don't know how to play, you should not participate. It may change in the future by increasing the size of pie, but for now, it is a beautiful zero sum. It means do not be the last sucker standing because you are going to suffer all the losses. If you don’t have insider knowledge or strategic advantage, you are not earning yield. You are the yield.

\[**Ugly**\] The real ugly part is the **hidden string attached**. Due to all the trade going on on ethereum, gas fees have shot through the roof. So **beware of gas fees, slippage fee, asset volatility.**

\[**Ugly**\] **Leveraged trading** can be good to secure greater upsides, but the downside can also be quite steep, especially since market is so volatile and you can get squeezed out quickly, if you have all your liquidity tied up in the the defi apps.

\[**Ugly**\] Because there are so many transactions (that may or may not be inflated), the transaction fees have soared. So, Ethereum is looking to i**ncrease the block size.** This is great for validators in the short run to increase their returns, but this is ugly risk in the long run because **ethereum network can be more vulnerable to attacks on the network.**

# 3. Economics of Yield Farming

* Token Design: Self-Reinforcing Mechanism. The token incentives create liquidity which starts a feedback loop.
* Valuation: at the end of the day, this method just encourages network effects without providing any real economic value. for protocols and projects to succeed, it depends on builders and users to stay on the platform for a long time, and not just during this movement. In the short term, we are also seeing an increase in token value.
* Token supply: this is a token supply increase, or supply inflation. It is also distributed to users with the highest volume. Instead of people paying for tokens, it is earned via the platform.
* Return of tokens: These tokens are not exactly free. early investors of the tokens have invested and receive tokens. they are happy for tokens to increase in value to cash out their returns. unless you have a strategic plan for using tokens to gain returns, you are just part of the plan. (Similar to IPO Pop)
* Transaction activities: borrowers are keen to borrow more because with the native token distribution, it is almost like they are subsidised to pay. The increase in trading results in higher transaction fees and attracts better returns as lenders.

# Apply To Your Project

This is a typical method for issuing tokens based on transaction volume, as we see in exchange tokens. Check out the BNB episode for the economics of that.

Yield farming is a growth hacking way to achieve network effects. It uses short-term incentives to drive user growth. At the end of the day, we are looking at the bigger game. In the long-run, how sustainable will the platform be. The real economic value comes from building products that benefits users in a sustainable manner, not with hypes and pumps. That means actual financial activity for DeFi protocols, so that monetary value increase is not just driven by ""sophisticated leveraged speculation"" but real value-add.

 

**TLDR**:

For crypto-entrepreneurs and long-term investors, yield farming works. But it is still a short-term incentive and not a long-term solution. So use this method with precaution."

CryptoCurrency,"My CRYPTO Margin trading experience! (Dont!) ($80k USD lost) So basically I have margin and futures traded on Crypto (Binance to be Specific) on various leverages, from 125x to 1.5x basically to learn a lesson that even the lowest setting in margin can get you liquidated. Cryptocurrency trading is a highly volatile asset market, and highly Volatile I mean expect %300 +- drops or gains. Most of us like me go for the gains, but when the market starts crashing down because of any FUD thats been perpetrated through Crypto media and Twitter FUD, the crash becomes inevitable, what makes the crash worse is that people like me on margin positions depending on the leverage position you are either about to lose a big a chunk of your Crypto or you are on your path to be liquidated in the crashes following that crash. To further understand this I have carefully assessed the lowest margin position I could and the results do not change, you are either in a panic mode wondering if you are going to be liquidated tomorrow or the week or month following that crash and perhaps paper hand your position to avoid further losses and look for a market bottom to re-enter your position, or leave the space to see the entire market pick up and fomo again. Long story short, this will keep happening this sort of whale manipulation or rinse and repeat and margin traders are perfect victim of this cycle and every other crypto cycle along with people who invest large chunks of their funds in shit coins. I know I am jumping through various points here, but basically my point is that if you are margin trading please dont, if you are investing in shit coins to make a quick bucks just to watch your entire portfolio melt then please dont. For crypto space to be healthy and have lower down sides people need to avoid using Margin trading AT ALL COSTS, no matter how tempting it gets. Its like playing a game of Jenga in a way. My advice, if you really believe in Crypto, which ever project it maybe BTC, ETH, DOT etc.. DCA or if you are dip /bottom buying guy go that route with your long term goal of whatever you set for yourself 2/5/10 years to see real gains.

CryptoCurrency,"How to earn a steady Cash-Flow with your Crypto-Bags! This is a strategy which the first Bitcoin Millionaire I know taught me a few months ago.

He himself makes about 30k monthly by using this strategy.

I am able now to fully live off my crypto portfolio by building a steady income stream without having to sell my crypto.

This strategy involves three different use cases in DeFi. Borrowing, Liquidity Mining and Staking. To find out more about these topics you can visit the r/liquiditymining Subreddit and read about those topics in detail.

I call this strategy the ""Free Cash Flow Strategy"".

Alright so let's begin...

I think most of us believe that Crypto in general will go far beyond the valuation it is currently at and this is why it should be our main focus to accumulate more Crypto and not sell any. But also just holding assets and not being able to spend anything is kinda boring. So let's combine both and hold Crypto + build a steady Cash Flow.

The concept involves depositing Crypto as Collateral on platforms like Aave, Compound, Nexo, Liquity and so on, taking a loan on the platforms and moving them to Liquidity Mining platforms like Pancakeswap, Curve, etc.

Let's dive into what I did exactly:

* I deposited most of my Crypto on Nexo (I started small to see if it works obv.)
* On Nexo I took a **50% LTV** (Loan-To-Value) Loan which means 50% of what I deposited. There I paid 12% interest on the loan.
* I then split my loan on different Platforms into **Stable Coin Pools** which back then generated about 30% APY.
* I then took my Liquidity Mining Rewards and put them into staking which was another 100% I made on my rewards.
* I paid the 12% fees and kept about 18% as **Free Cash Flow**

The environment has changed however. Since we're in a correction or bear market however you wanna call it the tokens which are distributed as rewards aren't as high as they used to be but this doesn't really matter since we can earn the money now and spend it when prices move higher.

What do I do differently now?

* I don't use Nexo anymore since the interest is too high compared to the rewards you get now from Stablecoin Liquidity Mining which are only about 10%. I use Liquity for ETH which charges 0% interest but a 0.5% deposit fee which is way better in the long-run. And I use Aave/Compound for things like BTC (WBTC) and almost any other token there I pay about 3-4% yearly interest.
* I don't use Liquidity Mining Platforms anymore but Liquidity Aggregators like Autofarm, Beefy.finance or Pancakebunny because they auto-compound the profits instantly and distribute their own platform token on top which results in more yield.

Let's look at the potential risk of Liquidation:

Let's say you deposit 2 BTC and 20 ETH split on Aave &amp; Compound to diversify which is about $100k. Then you take out a loan of $50k which is a LTV of 50%. **Remember to always take out your loan in stable coins because they have the least amount of risk involved!**

BTC has a Liquidation LTV of 75% which means you have a 25% threshold. Liquity will Liquidate you at a LTV of 90.09%.

What does that mean?

After you deposit your Crypto and take out a loan the price of BTC might go up or down. If it goes up your LTV decreases and if it goes down your LTV increases. The magic here is to always keep it as high as possible but not too high so you surpass the limit they set for each currency.

LTV = Loan / Collateral \* 100%

Example:

You deposit 3 BTC=100k and take out 50k in USDT = 50% LTV.

BTC drops from 33.3k to 30k -&gt; 3 x 30k = 90k -&gt; 50k / 90k \* 100% = 55% LTV

BTC drops from 30k to 20k -&gt; 3 x 20k = 60k -&gt; 50k / 60k \* 100% = 83% LTV = **Liquidated!**

**When you start and take out a loan you have to calculate at what price target you will get liquidated!** You need to keep this price in mind and if the price drops you can either pay back your loan or increase your collateral by depositing more Crypto to the platform.

Currently you can borrow stable coins for about 4% and do stable coin liquidity mining at a 20% APY. (We already made a post in r/liquiditymining talking about the highest stable coin LM APYs). If you then stake your rewards your APY can go higher to about 30-40% which leads you with a 26%-36% cash flow which at an investment of 100k and a loan of 50k means you can make between $13'000-$18'000 yearly which is a nice salary on top for doing nothing! :D

Keep in mind that if your coins you used as collateral go up (which they eventually will) you can borrow more capital and your cash flow increases!

And this ladies and gentlemen is how you keep your Crypto and build a nice cash flow on the side!

Feel free to ask anything in the comments and as always:

\- Happy Farming &lt;3"

Pretty much every adult (at least in the west) will need at least one (if not both of these things) in their lifetime, so how would you bring these into the crypto/DeFi space? Lending at the minute on DeFi is dependent on using your coins as collateral, but if you already had some collateral you probably wouldn't need a credit card?

CryptoCurrency,"If you were able to easily pay for everyday items with Bitcoin right now, would you actually do it? If you had the option to head down to your local bakery this afternoon, grab a coffee, maybe a nice ham and cheese croissant cause you feel a bit decadent, and then pay with Bitcoin, would you do it?

Most of us cherish holding our crypto, we want to see it realise it’s potential and grow in value. Equally, I think it’s fair to assume that a fair amount of us would also accept crypto as payment, maybe you sell that guitar you’ve had since you were 12 for 0.001 BTC?

But when it comes to parting with our crypto, are we ready to do it for everyday items? Or are we concerned that we might miss out on appreciating value?

I’ve seen some rumours and discussion lately about apple, and apple wallet being used for crypto transactions, alongside the occasional story of people paying for items with crypto such as one guy awhile back who paid roughly $80 in ETH for a haircut. Are you someone that would spend?

Personally, I don’t want to part ways with my crypto yet. If I can buy Maccas (Aussie slang for McDonalds) with BTC or dollars, I’m using my dollars.

I wonder when we’ll get to a point where this sentiment changes, or am I unusual for not wanting to pay with crypto yet?

CryptoCurrency,"If you were able to easily pay for everyday items with Bitcoin right now, would you actually do it? If you had the option to head down to your local bakery this afternoon, grab a coffee, maybe a nice ham and cheese croissant cause you feel a bit decadent, and then pay with Bitcoin, would you do it? 

Most of us cherish holding our crypto, we want to see it realise it’s potential and grow in value. Equally, I think it’s fair to assume that a fair amount of us would also accept crypto as payment, maybe you sell that guitar you’ve had since you were 12 for 0.001 BTC? 

But when it comes to parting with our crypto, are we ready to do it for everyday items? Or are we concerned that we might miss out on appreciating value? 

I’ve seen some rumours and discussion lately about apple, and apple wallet being used for crypto transactions, alongside the occasional story of people paying for items with crypto such as one guy awhile back who paid roughly $80 in ETH for a haircut. Are you someone that would spend? 

Personally, I don’t want to part ways with my crypto yet. If I can buy Maccas (Aussie slang for McDonalds) with BTC or dollars, I’m using my dollars. 

I wonder when we’ll get to a point where this sentiment changes, or am I unusual for not wanting to pay with crypto yet?"
CryptoCurrency,"​Anonymity and cryptocurrencies **​Anonymity and cryptocurrencies**

&amp;#x200B;

There is a false idea about the anonymity of cryptocurrencies. I am sure that many of you think that using Bitcoin, your operations and transactions are encrypted and cannot be tracked by third parties at all. This is not true.

&amp;#x200B;

Bitcoin, like the vast majority of cryptocurrencies, is pseudonymous. What does it mean? Let's figure it out.

&amp;#x200B;

All the anonymity of Bitcoin and most other cryptocurrencies is manifested only in the fact that the address of your crypto wallet is not tied to your identity in any way. That is, when you start a new wallet, you should not provide any data about yourself, and in fact, anyone can be the owner of the wallet. You can also transfer the wallet to someone else's possession to anyone. But that's all. This is where all anonymity ends.

&amp;#x200B;

Otherwise, Bitcoin is the opposite of anonymity. The Bitcoin blockchain is a solid notebook where every transaction ever made in the entire history of the Bitcoin network is recorded. And it's all in the public domain. You can go to this site (or to this one if it is Ethereum), enter the address of the Bitcoin wallet there, and find out how much money is in the account, when and from whom this money came, went, etc. Full transparency and openness.

&amp;#x200B;

Some of you will probably say: ""Well, what's the difference? No one can prove that this is my wallet! "" And you will be right, but not always.

&amp;#x200B;

You are right only if your wallet is really anonymous and no one knows about its existence except you. But if you have entered the address of your wallet in crypto exchanges or published it somewhere on the Internet, then there is a huge chance that you and your crypto wallet can be connected. Do not forget that at the request of the authorities (or individuals on the black market), any social network, provider, the mobile operator will hand over any information about you. And then you will just need to connect the dots to have dirt on you.

&amp;#x200B;

""Listen, why do I need all this at all? I'm not hiding anything from anyone! "" -one of you will say. But this post is not about hiding something from someone. The only purpose of this post is to dispel the myth of the anonymity of cryptocurrencies. 

&amp;#x200B;

If you still need to remain anonymous and be sure that your transactions cannot be tracked, then take a closer look at such coins as Monero and Zcash. They were created as completely anonymous cryptocurrencies."

CryptoCurrency,"If someone offered you ""free money"" you would assume it's a scam, right? You should do the same for crypto. Most ways to earn free crypto are scams or give you cents for hours of effort. Here are the only three I think are worth your time. Every day, there are threads presenting either [specific new ways](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/ok4ldw/one_of_the_most_fun_ways_of_earning_free_crypto/) of earning free crypto or [endless](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/oioluu/earn_some_crypto/) [lists](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/oke3y6/a_writeup_of_my_favourite_methods_for_passive/) of different ways to do so. Everyone likes free money, but here's the thing: most of these are scams, and most of the others are not worth it.

Sure, you can use Brave browser or a few months and see thousands of ads to earn a dollar in BAT, or you could exploit a faucet and get free crypto from there every day for a few weeks, to end up with something like a dollar once again (this is not what faucets are for, please don't do this). You could spam all your social media feeds promoting some scam coin because they promised you you would get an airdrop if you did. I would argue, however, that this is not the best way to spend your time. Not considering stuff like staking that can definitely pay off, but that requires that you already own crypto, there are three ways of earning free crypto for beginners without crypto who want to start out with crypto but don't want to invest yet that, in my opinion, are worth your time:

1) r/CryptoCurrency Moons. You get moons every 28 days if you participate on this sub, if you have opened your vault, depending on the amount of karma you collect. You can get a ton of free crypto here - not as much as a year ago, but i only posted here for the past like 4 months and have over 10k moons, currently worth about $1,000 - and it absolutely is possible that they will be worth much more in the future. If you are interested in crypto and would post here anyway, this is a great way to earn free tokens. See the [Introduction to Moons](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/gj96lb/introducing_rcryptocurrency_moons/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=usertext&amp;utm_name=CryptoCurrency&amp;utm_content=t3_okgzix) and the [Moons wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/wiki/moons_wiki/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=usertext&amp;utm_name=CryptoCurrency&amp;utm_content=t3_okgzix) for more info.

2) [Coinbase Earn](https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/getting-started/getting-started-with-coinbase/coinbase-earn-faq-and-terms). You need an account on Coinbase, have it verified, and you need to live in an eligible country.^(A) They show you some information about specific crypto and then ask really easy question, you get a small amount of that crypto if you get them right (you can retry them), you get the money immediately. I personally never spent money on Coinbase and got a lot of money on there (probably around $250 - I originally got less, but many coins went up in value a lot since I did the respective quizzes). **Con: I've read many times that people were stuck in a queue and could not participate in the quizzes, I personally never had that problem.**

3) [Coinmarketcap Earn](https://coinmarketcap.com/earn/). It's similar, but a bit worse. You need a verified account on Binance, some countries are excluded from participating (one of them being the US).^(B) Again, you can answer a few questions about some crypto and you get small amounts (usually a bit bigger than on Coinbase Earn) if you get them right - but, in this case, you only have one chance and need to get all of them right. If you get them right, and if you are quick enough, the coins usually get sent to your Binance account after a few weeks. **Con: I've seen many people state that they never got any coins even though they got everything right, even calling it a scam. It is definitely not a scam, I got coins multiple times, but the quizzes often run longer than they should and only the first few thousand participants receive coins. You can always** [**check the status**](https://coinmarketcap.com/earn/token-distribution-status) **of your coins or why you will not get them on their page.**

All in all, I got much more than $1,000 with these three methods - earning moons just hanging out and having fun on this sub, and only spending a few minutes with the quizzes (they are really not long). While there might be other ways of earning free crypto for beginners, I haven't found any others that are worth your time - but I am looking forwardto you proving me wrong!

CryptoCurrency,"BNB Pioneer Burn Program to reimburse for ""lost"" BSC crypto – brilliant idea or petty loophole News: Binance is going to introduce the BNB Pioneer Burn Program. 

Basically, if you ""lost"" an amount of BNB or any other binance-pegged/wrapped token over $1,000 (like sent it to a smart contract address, which nobody has control over), you let Binance know, they verify and then REIMBURSE you minus the network fees!

Where do the money come from? Binance still can't recover your lost funds and they still can't mint new tokens. But, since they regularly burn their team's tokens, they will deduct the corresponding amount of BNB from their burn. In effect, Binance will burn less BNB's, but only because YOU already burned those for them! 

Here is their example: *Assume 1,000,000 BNB will be burned in the upcoming BNB burn event for the third quarter of 2020. However, before the event, we had returned 5,000 BNB to users through the BNB Pioneer Burn program. As a result, for our Q3 burn, we will burn 995,000 BNB instead (the original 1,000,000 BNB burn amount minus the 5,000 BNB that went to the BNB Pioneer Burn program).*   

On the one hand, the idea is great – throwing a lifeline to the pioneers who messed up when trying out new tech. And it doesn't require centralized censorship of the blockchain to revert transactions. **Should other blockchains do this as well?**

On the other hand, it is Binance who will decide whom to reimburse and, in the end, BURN LESS TOKENS! Remember they SWORE and keep claiming they WILL NOT SELL a single BNB from their team's stash. Now I think they can) while still sitting on that high horse)

What do you think of this?

CryptoCurrency,"Top 10 Cryptocurrencies to invest in 2021  

### 1. Bitcoin (BTC)

**Market cap: Over $641 billion**

Bitcoin’s price has skyrocketed as it’s become a household name. Five years ago, you could buy a Bitcoin for about $500. As of June 2021, a single Bitcoin’s price was over $32,000. That’s growth of about 6,300%.

### 2. Ethereum (ETH)

**Market cap: Over $307 billion**

Ethereum has also experienced tremendous growth. In just five years, its price went from about $11 to over $2,500, increasingly roughly more than 22,000%.

### 3. Tether (USDT)

**Market cap: Over $62 billion**

Unlike some other forms of cryptocurrency, Tether is a stablecoin, meaning it’s backed by fiat currencies like U.S. dollars and the Euro and hypothetically keeps a value equal to one of those denominations. In theory, this means Tether’s value is supposed to be more consistent than other cryptocurrencies, and it’s favored by investors who are wary of the extreme volatility of other coins.

### 4. Binance Coin (BNB)

**Market cap: Over $56 billion**

Its price in 2017 was just $0.10; by June 2021, it had risen to over $350, a gain of almost 350,000%.

### 5. Cardano (ADA)

**Market cap: Over $51 billion**

Cardano’s ADA token has had relatively modest growth compared to other major crypto coins. In 2017, ADA’s price was $0.02. As of June 2021, its price was at $1.50. This is an increase of 7,400%.

### 6. Dogecoin (DOGE)

**Market cap: Over $44 billion**

[Dogecoin](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/what-is-dogecoin/) has been a hot topic thanks to celebrities and billionaires like Elon Musk. 

Dogecoin’s price in 2017 was $0.0002. By June 2021, its price was at $0.32—a 159,900% increase.

### 7. XRP (XRP)

**Market cap: Over $40 billion**

At the beginning of 2017, the price of XRP was $0.006. As of June 2021, its price reached $0.92, equal to a rise of 15,233%.

### 8. USD Coin (USDC)

**Market cap: Over $23 billion**

Like Tether, USD Coin (USDC) is a stablecoin, meaning it’s backed by U.S. dollars and aims for a 1 USD to 1 USDC ratio. USDC is powered by Ethereum, and you can use USD Coin to complete global transactions.

### 9. Polkadot (DOT)

**Market cap: Over $21 billion**

Between September 2020 and June 2021, its price grew 615%, from $2.93 to $20.95.

### 10. Uniswap (UNI)

**Market cap: Over $13 billion**

Launched in 2020, Uniswap’s price started at $0.48. By June 2021, its price was $24.60, a gain of 5,025%.

3. Any Bitcoin fork is a waste of time. Imagine if the creator of the universe could create a knock off gold at any time and put it in the ground for us. For value, we seek items that have rare properties. meanwhile Satoshi created the scarcest asset known to mankind.
4. Not even one of the largest countries could cripple Bitcoin.
5. There's **way** smarter people than me that already understand this and are doing everything they can to accumulate as much as possible via manipulation. And they know there is a small time window to do this. It feels like just yesterday I bought the dip at $3,000. This thing is going into the millions.
6. People that make fun of or disregard Bitcoin are completely wrong. There is no ""opinion"" on Bitcoin, it just exists as it was created to be.

For instance, on **bscscan** I can check activity of scammer's wallet and see: I'm not the only person who were scammed (23 people if to be precise - I know it because every transaction has the same amount of BNB - the price of scammer's offer). At the end all ""earned"" money where transferred to the PancakeSwap.

So, I wander, is it possible to:

1. Is it possible somehow to write a message to each person who were scammed by their wallet (for instance if this is a **binance** wallet, not the cold wallet)?
2. If I or every person from that list will write to **PancakeSwap** \- could they help to freeze the money scammers transfer to their system? I don't want my money back but I would be very happy if this person earn ""0"" with his fraud."

CryptoCurrency,"Learning from a mistake It was august 2020 and I wanted to exchange some Eth for Snx token as the defi season was looking very promising. Of course as every crypto guy that is going to make a bad mistake I was hit by fomo and wanted to make this exchange happen very quickly. So without any learning about the process and the risks, I created a metamask account, charged it with some Eth and looked for Uniswap on google. As I said it was the first time I was using a dex (decentralized exchange) so I didn’t know anything about it.
I googled Uniswap and I clicked on the first result (which was sponsored).
I was in a hurry so when the website asked me for the seed words to link my wallet I blindly fell in the trap. 
I later found out that the website was a fake version but it somehow appeared first in the google results. That’s how I lost 0,7 Eth (around 300$ at the time).

But there’s a positive thing about my reaction. I knew it was my fault so I stayed calm and thought that I would use this scam as an investment for my future. 
I said to me that 300$ was a high enough price for this lesson and didn’t want the price to be 0,7 Eth (I believed in Ethereum ‘s future value). So what I did right after the same day was to buy the lost quantity of Eth, spending 300$.
Happy about that decision now that I look back at it. 

Here what I learned:
even when something bad happens, always keep focused and don’t get caught by frustration and sense of guilt."

CryptoCurrency,"Learn: What the h*** is a stablecoin? - Hi guys 👋, during a two-hour car ride, I chose to look into stablecoins, as I saw enormous interest rates. So below is the information I gathered from a range of different sites and put together for myself, and now for you guys. Sorry for potential layout mistakes, as I’ve put this together on my phone 😂. Enjoy - 

Basically, stablecoins suggest a new alternative for reducing price volatility in the crypto landscape. The volatility makes cryptocurrency somewhat unreliable as a suitable currency for exchanging goods and services. So, the best stablecoins which have emerged in the crypto space have solved this problem. By nature, stablecoins are highly fixed in terms of value when compared to general cryptocurrency alternatives. 

According to a report by CB Insights, the overall value of stablecoin assets has crossed well over $20 billion in late 2020. Stablecoins have gained traction as they attempt to offer the best of both worlds—the instant processing and security or privacy of payments of cryptocurrencies, and the volatility-free stable valuations of fiat currencies.

They promise lower volatility, which makes them useful for converting between fiat and other cryptocurrencies. Some of the most prominent examples are: USDT, TUSD, DAI, PAX, GUSD.

What makes fiat currency free from extreme volatility? 

When a fiat currency’s valuations may move drastically, the controlling authorities jump in and manage the demand and supply of currency to maintain price stability. The bulk of cryptocurrencies lacks both these key features - they don’t have a reserve backing their valuations and they don’t have a central authority to control prices when required. Stablecoins attempt to bridge this gap between fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies.

The different types of stablecoins

Stablecoins can be fixed to almost anything in theory, there are Stablecoins fixed to multiple fiat coins and even to precious items like gold or silver. Four main categories exists: 

Backed by a commodity: Stablecoins that are pegged against commodities generally have the backing of hard assets for stability. The hard assets could include real estate or gold. 

Backed by a crypto asset: Crypto-collateralized stablecoins are backed by other cryptocurrencies. Since the reserve cryptocurrency may also be prone to high volatility, such stablecoins are “over-collateralized”—that is, a larger number of cryptocurrency tokens is maintained as reserve for issuing a lower number of stablecoins. More frequent audits and monitoring add to price stability. However, because the crypto values themselves are not stable, these Stablecoins need to use a set of protocols to ensure that the price of the stablecoin issued remains at $1.

Backed by fiat currency: Fiat-backed cryptocurrencies as the most commonly accessible stablecoins. Such types of stablecoin have the backing of fiat currencies such as the US Dollar, Euro, or Chinese Yuan, which are kept as collateral (a fiat currency reserve is maintained). Such reserves are maintained by independent custodians and are regularly audited for adherence to the necessary compliance. Production and liquidation of the coin is carried out by the issuer of the coin. 

Backed by an algorithm: Non-collateralized stablecoins don’t use any reserve but include a working mechanism, like that of a central bank, to retain a stable price. For instance, the dollar-pegged basecoin uses a consensus mechanism to increase or decrease the supply of tokens on need basis.

But… but… but…

Placing you money in a stable coin is not without its risks as many stablecoins lack consumer protections and provide patchy, frequently unaudited accounts of the reserves meant to back their coins. Tether, the $60bn stablecoin, was fined $18.5m by the New York attorney-general over allegations it lied about its reserves. 

When should you care about stablecoins?

If you cannot keep a close eye on market conditions or changes, or if you are simply not familiar with all these, it may be wise to keep your digital assets in Stablecoins. Also, during bearish market times, you can favourably keep your digital assets in stablecoins. 

Why are they interesting? 

With stablecoins you can minimise volatility, trade or save assets, transfer money cheaply, send money internationally, and lastly the one I’m going to focus on here, you can earn interests. 

Currently, exchanges like crypto.com offer up to 14% (!!!!) p.a. Interest on certain stablecoins. To me, that sounds ludicrous, as my bank currently offers me next to no interest (some even make you pay for keeping your OWN money with them). So what is going on in the crypto space? 

How can you get a hold of these high interest rates?

By using a third-party crypto loan platform - you will be lending your stablecoins out. In return, you will be paid a rate of interest that in many cases is significantly higher than what you can get through a traditional savings account.

Your chosen crypto loan platform will charge the end-user a higher rate than what you receive in interest (called the spread) – this is how the provider is able to pay you. 

However, there seem to be two main risks: (1) As mentioned earlier, a stablecoin provider needs to hold a reserve of an asset, so at some point it comes down to trust, and their ability to keep the reserve intact. (2) You need to consider the safety of the platform itself. After all, it is not the stablecoin provider that is paying you interest. On the contrary, this is paid by a third-party that collects digital currencies from depositors and then lends the funds out via a loan agreement. Furthermore, you are NOT insured.

Lastly, you should be aware that most places (if not all?) you have to “lock up” your stablecoin holding for a certain period of time to accrue the “abnormal” interest rates. 

TL;DR - You can place your savings in high interest stablecoins, but it is, in theory, at the risk of losing your entire investment."
CryptoCurrency,"How early are we? **Answer:** extremely. 

~1.1-1.3% of the world owns BTC right now ([Source](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/how-many-bitcoin-users/)). 

17% of adult Americans own BTC ([Source](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/about-46-million-americans-now-own-bitcoin-2021-05-14)).

**Where does that put BTC on the trajectory of adoption (in the US)?**:

[Adoption Rates of Major Technologies, 1990-2021](https://i.postimg.cc/7Z5d47HH/Screenshot-20210719101838-1006x707.png)

In reality, it's &lt;17%. Many have not truly adopted BTC/crypto, but are merely short-term speculative traders or those caught up in the hype. Post-crash estimates may be as low as ~5-8%. And the number of active addresses for BTC is currently ~500,000 - meaning just a tiny fraction of the world is actually *using* BTC. 

Most cryptocurrencies would not even register on this chart yet. 

I don't care to comment on short- or long-term market dynamics, make any predictions or address the resistance crypto will face. I only wish to acknowledge how amazing it is that we're all here - at the beginning of what could be the next big, tech-revolution."
CryptoCurrency,"Honest question, if they have nothing to hide, why the hell won’t stablecoins (including USDC) just fully disclose the investment assets backing them? I’ve been following the stable coin FUD pretty closely. Especially with US regulators starting to investigate.

Tether especially is raising some big eyebrows. With shifting goalposts and mystery “commercial paper” they won’t disclose. 

But even USDC is acting shady as hell.

First they claim they’re backed 1 to 1 to USD, then they say “actually we’re only backed by partial cash, the rest are “approved investments”.

But then they don’t disclose the investments. 

Ok makes sense I guess, the companies need to make money, and they do that by putting the cash reserves to work. So why didn’t they just come out and say that’s how they profit in the first place? And why won’t they disclose the investments?

Banks do the same thing with investing cash….but they don’t (and can’t) really hide what they’re doing with it. And ultimately banks are regulated as banks, insured by the FDIC. 

Stable coins are asking the entire crypto universe to “trust us” with supporting essentially the entire exchange market’s liquidity.

If they have nothing to hide, why don’t they just show all the cards?

Presumably USDC could be backed by something safe like treasury notes. Cool, great… just say that then!  What’s the risk in publicly saying it’s backed with treasury notes?

It’d be so easy to end the stable coin FUD, but for some reason they’re choosing not to. And I can’t think of any legit reason."

CryptoCurrency,"Bitcoin and Etherium are already ETFs with their trading patterns. Maybe just an epithany for me, for altcoins, I think Bitcoin and ETH already serves as an etf (so to speak) seeing all alts are linked to them in a way. 

Although the actual definition doesn't fit, the trading patterns are similar as ETFs or index funds on the stock market. If I were to invest in Vanguard, I would get more conservative returns than to YOLO on one stock for example. If the market is down (BTC or ETH) your stock is down.

CryptoCurrency,"BTC or Gold for protecting you money from inflation? The reason why we're investing in stuff (shares, valuable metals, etc.) is to protect our money from inflation and losing it's value. Why people are so enthusiastic of BTC and not gold or usd? (the currency of most powerful country.) Let's look at the buying power of the USD on a timeline chart.

[As you can see. for every passing year, the buying power of one USD is going down exponentially. People who held USD as an investment since 2000's has lost \~60&amp;#37; of their money's buying power.](https://preview.redd.it/latk7rs4a4c71.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b934e7b234e3545f833a974acaee947b2dc37acd)

So what about gold? what if I were to put my money into gold instead of USD? it's much more profitable right? Let's see. [Link to the chart.](https://www.macrotrends.net/1333/historical-gold-prices-100-year-chart)

[This is the inflation adjusted chart for GOLD. As you can see, people who bought gold from 1980's until 2000's to protect their money from inflation and losing it's value, let alone earned any money but lost around 80&amp;#37; of their money. And those who HODL'ed their golds are still not recovered completely.](https://preview.redd.it/rpke6scjb4c71.png?width=888&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a76086d44004df01fae94335a52b22d2f4e3009d)

And then we have crypto currencies. But everyone thinks that BTC has gone from &lt;1$ to 64k$ and now it's over, we were too late and can't make money etc. For you beatiful people, I would like to share this chart to give you some perspective on where we're on crpto market.

[The run hasn't even begun yet. We're still too early on crypto market. and if you have some btc in your wallet rn, you're not the one who's late but the one who's very early in.](https://preview.redd.it/7rlvcrr7d4c71.jpg?width=780&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6a058ce2a48a1e9999b188ab88b652a329cd24f3)

And lastly, to compare BTC ""crypto"" with other valuable assets, I think this chart will open your eyes on why BTC's prive will always, always go up regardless of what's going on in the world.

CryptoCurrency,"It is never late to DCA. Slow and steady does it Let's me start off with the most obvious fact. I have no idea if the price will tank or moon within the next day, week, month, year or more to come. There are too many factors to keep in mind, such as (but not limited to) news, hype, FUD, insider info and Technical analysis. When you combine all that together, it all comes down to ""who the hell knows what will happen with that volatile mix of information"".

Also *NOT A FINANCIAL, NOR PROFESSIONAL, ADVICE*. Make safe decisions for yourselves! 

However two things are certain:

1) if the project is actually good, so is its investment

2) marketing! Currently as I'm trying to get my book out in the market, I know one thing, no matter how good it will be, I know I won't go far without either luck of readers spreading word or solid marketing

If your liked crypto project has these two, no matter the time, it may very well soar in price one day. Could be tomorrow. Could be next few years.

Point is, make small steps. It doesn't matter if you DCA two doggit baby funds, or some serious funds. Do, however, play it safe enough to have some fiat ready for worldwide crash.

A good investment eventually pays off.

Don't get scared by the current downtrend. Relax. DCA, if you don't have funds to do so, fund something else to do in the meantime, while you wait for payday. Remember to do it responsibly though.

Thanks for reading, may you all have great gains, be they financial, technical or both!"

CryptoCurrency,"How would you like to make 6% a day on your investments? Someone tried to scam me on reddit. It was the single most obvious scam I have ever seen someone try to push. They started promising 6% a DAY on my investment. Lets take a look at the anatomy of a scammer in case these red flags are new to some of you. 

First off they tried to be friendly and hook greedy people with the idea of making money easily. They also prey on fear, saying that ""bitcoin is dropping past resistance levels"". Then they casually asked me where I was from. I told them Zeta Reticulon (not even the right name for the star) and they didn't even stop to think about what I just said. The first two major red flags of a scam are easy money and personal information. 

Then I told them I was already involved in risky behaviors trying to push it to see how ridiculous of a pitch they would throw my way. [ I told them I was in a program that was netting me 1% a day, every day.](https://imgur.com/Kyrltjh) Anything offering that kind of reward is almost certainly a scam. Just for reference a $10,000 investment at 1% a day, compounded daily, sitting for 3 years would be worth $544,785,657.92. Yup half a billion dollars. 

This guy didn't stop at 1%. [I told him I was getting one percent and he shot back with this. Yup you read that right! The max they were offering is 10% in 12 hours.](https://imgur.com/Ahh0Tae) Or 20% in 24 hours. Every darn day. I ran that through a compound interest calculator and let it sit for the same 3 years. That would be 6.0624151E+90 or a 6 then 90 zeros. Lets just write that out: 

$6,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000

These people have no shame. If they could really get those returns they would never ever tell you. Not only that but I am pretty sure that means my 10k investment would be worth more than all the money on the earth. These people prey on the greedy, the desperate, and people who don't do math. I asked them why they would ever let me in on this, I mean clearly they don't need the money. [Look at this response.](https://imgur.com/0RGXLOX) 

Don't worry r/CC fam, they just want to help people. See they are nice. It isn't a Ponzi, nope not at all. They just help traders! Oh it makes so much sense now. Why didn't I think of that before.

Crypto will really help me get through this. The value of the baht has fallen from roughly 30 to the dollar earlier in the year to almost 33. Even putting it in USDC would have netted me 10% baht to baht. During the 2008 recession it got up to 35 and during the last coup got up to 36. Being able to invest in crypto and stablecoins keeps value in the money I make. It isn't falling as the economy fails. Being an expat, I also have to move currency from the US to Thailand. Crypto saves me immensely there. Low fees and fast. 

If another coup comes and/or this covid crisis continues, I feel the value of my fiat will continue to fall. I'm moving as much into crypto as I can and recommending my friends in Thailand to do the same. Protect their finances against politics, against inflation, against crisis. Crypto will help me dramatically and I'm glad it's here. I just felt the need to post to show how crypto really can help and protect people, and how it helps me."
CryptoCurrency,"Staking crypto is a zero-sum game, since Inflation-adjusted gains are zero. Change my mind. Fully distributed coins like Nano and PoS coins like ADA are almost the same.

In nano there are no rewards but no inflation either.

In ADA you get staking rewards, but rewards dilute your share of circulating ADA. In an ideal world where everyone stakes their coins, the inflation-adjusted rewards are zero.

Note: I am NOT against PoS. I simply want people to be aware that ""high APY"" staking is not pure profit, it's also inflation."

CryptoCurrency,Weird thought about an economic crisis and crypto? If our dollar were to go to shits likes Venezuela and Iran and all crypto would go up to the moon but not everyone is in crypto what would be our exchange rate like we wouldn't want to trade crypto for us fiat so would we only exchange it for real estate or other things that haven't gone to shit. Alot of people cash out but what happens when our cash is like cut in half would we trade for euros etc others stable countries cash cause if not everyone was in crypto how would they accept it and we wouldn't want to exchange our valuable asset for groceries gas so how would crypto heavy people pay for stuff just a weird thought about an economic collapse. I guess we would only deal with business that accept crypto cause everything else went to dookie

CryptoCurrency,"Reddit, NFT, Moons and the SEC 🌙🇺🇸 This is my own opinion on what will happen in the future with Moons and Reddit.

In 2015, Reddit launched Reddit Notes to users (5 million $ worth I think) which are basically Moons but Centralized with Reddit controlling everything, This probably got Reddit into problems with the SEC and the project was deleted.


In 2020, Reddit introduced Moons, on Paper Moons doesn’t have monetary value! This will keep the SEC away because these are points with no value!

But here is the smart part 🧠:
Moons are on the Blockchain, If you earn them, no one can take them from you even Reddit themselves (Unlike Reddit Notes), Now for the “No Monetary Value “ part:

ERC 20 can be traded on any exchange without Reddit’s request/approval to list them, that’s the power of blockchain! (Moons are not even on Mainnet and can be traded already!)

Ok but if Moons get listed on exchanges,  how can Reddit benefit from this? They can’t send Moons to trade because the SEC will be monitoring them.

So here’s what can happen:
Reddit will publish many NFTs for sale.
Reddit declare wallet hack and Moons get withdrawn from their wallet, sent to an exchange, traded for ETH then scrambled to get laundered ETH that are not associated with the Moons.

Reddit will buy their own NFT with the clean ETH and GG! 
Reddit sold their Moons and got clean ETH / $ to their bank account!






Again, this is my own opinion and prediction 😊"
CryptoCurrency,"What reason would there be to perform a transaction like this one? Here's the transaction details: https://etherscan.io/tx/0x6449bdf75effb77781ede164a2fbfff2f3bb834ee0c8904a078aa58187cf5cad .

In this transaction, somebody is supplying 250K PMON and 54 ETH to a newly created Uniswap exchange to create a liquidity pool that allows the swapping of ETH and PMON.

The problem is, that at the time, ETH was at $1,919.98, and PMON was at $32.55. So they were adding $103,630.32 in ETH and $8,137,500 in PMON.

This kind of liquidity adding would almost certainly be taken advantage of would it not? Essentially, I could immediately use uniswap to swap ETH for PMON at a rate much higher than the wider market could provide right? The immediate next transaction in the block did exactly that: https://etherscan.io/tx/0x6f8a4dd3eb301cf6889cd05df46d936cccc0aeb1c76f10a714fb265c24d2b3de .

My question is, why would anybody add liquidity at a ratio of PMON:ETH that was so far from the ratio based on the true market value (nearly 80 times too high)? The correct ratio can be checked beforehand and such a mistake can so easily be taken advantage of; why would anybody perform this transaction? Is there any reason to expose oneself to liquidity sniping so egregiously?

We propose media blasts saying *&lt;ICN&gt;* supports the end of blah blah blah, like what [Crypto.com](https://Crypto.com) did with its advertising. It should be a believable goal, though.

But with this approach, a global problem is attached to a popular coin and new avenues are opened for people who believe the cause in let's say, Dominican Republic or Ghana or Holland or Malaysia, and in turn, popular coin becomes mainstream and the global problem is handled by the people who have an effective approach in ending it.

CryptoCurrency,"Why would anyone buy GBTC through Grayscale it's just gambling So I decided to try understand how the Grayscale trust works. When their webpage and did some TA on thier chart and FA on terms and conditions 

https://grayscale.com/products/grayscale-bitcoin-trust/


From my understanding 

1. You give them $50,000.00 to purchase BTC. Which they charge a 2% annual fee ( $1000)
2. In exchange you get GBTC shares at a rate of 0.00093992 Satoshi per share. So ~1,064 GBT = 1 BTC 
3. You have to hold the shares in lock up for 6 months before you can sell them in a secondary market 

This seems all ok on the surface until you realise that GBTC is currently trading at ~$26. So I BTC is being sold for ~$27,661.93 which at current BTC prices of ~$31,600.00 is a -10.5% discount 

Once again if you are buying it's all good because you are getting BTC at below market value. However you have the lock up period 

People who purchased GBTC through Grayscale in January had an opposite scenario happen. They purchased at a premium of nearly 11.26% 


https://ycharts.com/companies/GBTC/discount_or_premium_to_nav

They bought BTC at a 11.56% higher price and now are being given the ""privilege"" of selling at -12% below market value 

If wanting to get into GBTC I would suggest just buying it when the discount is super low on the secondary market. It was -21% in May and if BTC pricr pumps you can maybe sell it with the premium up again 

For the unlock today I have to be a little vulgar 

Its fucked, you see some of the people who got GBTC in January are filthy financial degenerates who smoke leverage on the daily 

They bought in using $100s of Millions if not a billions of borrowed funds. Now are selling close break even or in loss. Plus fees they are definitely in the shit 

Their only plays are to

1. Borrow more money and buy BTC in the market in the hope it pumps 

2. Dump GBTC are open today before other degenerates do 

3. Pray BTC drops below $27,661.93 so that GBTC gains primium again"

CryptoCurrency,"Physical Crypto Bank Proposal and Decentralized System: Smart or not Currently, many parts of society rely on the bank as the intermediary. Even when buying crypto, this can be a problem. We have to rely on a banking system in order to transfer to crypto to get real access to our money. 

A decentralized system cannot take place when relying on intermediaries. The ownership of the system should be distributed among the people, not the system itself. This is why some sort of physical network must be created in order to further advance blockchain. Instead of using banks, fiat can be sent to a physical network where currency will be burned and exchanged into cryptocurrency without having to worry about high fees of an ATM. 

Conversely, a peer to peer system can take place where fiat can be exchange into crypto. The thing which will be different is that all cash and standard currency will eventually end up in a physical Crypto Bank. 

A truly decentralized system is needed to give access to all. Recently, Turkey has banned the usage of cryptocurrency. This is why barriers need to be broken to make crypto accessible to more people. 

Please share any ideas which would make or break crypto by introducing a physical Crypto Bank."

CryptoCurrency,"How does an exclusive cryptocurrency get a value? Okay, So I have searched for answers on the Internet, but most of them ends up as `""...value is largely dependent on its supply and the market's demand for it."" ` . 

Lets say I need to build a cryptocurrency exclusively for my college (lets say I name it Crpt). How I plan to add a value is that there will be a collective fund(say a bank account) where if a student gives $1 to that fund, we will give him 1crpt (assuming 1crpt = $1). Now that 1crpt could be used anywhere in the college and even be given back to the fund to receive $1. 

Now here is a problem. To make a transaction, we would need miners. And miners have to be rewarded. But if we reward the miners, we have to make crpts out of thin air and eventually the dollar in the fund would be less than actual crypts in the network. This would be a problem if someday all the crpt holders decide to cash out from the fund. 

So how do we actually make a viable cryptocurrency that is exclusive to particular regions?"

CryptoCurrency,"How can I DCA effectively in this cryptic market and store money? I want to DCA some of the fiat that I am earning from restaurant work. It might not be much, but it's honest work. Let's say I can earn on average $25-$30 in tips and have that sent to blockchain. 

I won't be able to have that fiat available to DCA since it takes time to convert it into blockchain data. The whole process would have to be through the bank first and wait for a deposit, where I can then send fiat to an exchange. 

As far I storing my fiat, I plan to keep it separately and maybe put it in another crypto place. I want to figure out where exactly I can put my fiat after earning daily. If there is a p2p network, then this can make everything more efficient, since my coins and fiat dollars can be convert to crypto more efficiently.

Maybe I can turn my fiat into a stablecoin and decide what to do with it from there. But I don't really know much about how this works, apart from centralized exchanges and a bit of dex knowledge. 

I want my DCA portion to be separated from my original crypto positions. The DCA portion will be more of a savings account for my earnings, where I can deposit that and constantly add. Maybe in the future I will get more in there."
CryptoCurrency,"Investing in bitcoin as a poor person In terms of return, if I am only able to muster up $2-3k in the next year to put into bitcoin and bitcoin goes up to £100k in the next few years, I'd be up to 6kish? In the long run, if it were to hit a $1m, my return would 60k? (I've also played around with dome dcabtc.com values).

I'm wondering whether at this point, it's better to go all out on low market cap coins for a real chance at returns (or if it's worth it at all). (Though, this does seem more like gambling).

I'm sure this is probably a childish question or has been answered before but would appreciate some guidance.

CryptoCurrency,"Ongoing portfolio diversification (reviewing mine before taking a step back) Hey all, 

I am relatively new to crypto.

I wanted to post to gather a general sentiment on peoples thoughts on particular projects going forward. My introduction to crypto was a $300 purchase split between DOGE, SHIB and HOGE. This was the best mistake to happen as I learnt a valuable lesson for only $300. 

I have come a long way in my research and reading. My current portfolio sits at:

40% BTC

40% ETH

20% ADA

The reason I post is to try and gain more perspective on others thoughts which I really find valuable despite how much others seem to hate it. I enjoy reading about new/alt projects. I plan to continue to DCA on these splits.

Ultimately, I need to take a step back in the next few weeks from reading/keeping up with it all on a daily basis as I am a healthcare worker and play sport semi-professionally. I want to engage as many thoughts and perspectives here to possibly include another ALT coin into my ongoing diversification.  

What are your project recommendations? 

What makes up your portfolio?

Lots of love :)"

CryptoCurrency,"Buying Crypto vs. Paying Down Credit Card Debt A friend just talked to me about using his credit cards to BTFD.  And he already had credit card debt before this.

For god's sake people, don't rack up credit card debt to accumulate crypto.  The rate on a lot of those cards is over 20% per year.

You want crypto to disrupt the traditional banking/fiat system, right?  Think about it this way ... by racking up credit card debt, you're increasing the profits of some of the most predatory of all the fiat institutions -&gt; credit card issuers.

Don't support the thing that you want to destroy.  Pay off those credit card balances first.  There will always be time to DCA into crypto afterwards.  And remember, the dip may dip further in the meantime, so once you have those credit cards paid off, you might get better prices.

\*this happened two months ago but I think its still relevant today\*

So, Jamie Dimon is advising us to stay away from things that don’t have assets backing them up. Right, so does that mean I should stay away from the US dollar? Good advice I guess. 

What are your thoughts on this? It sounds pretty hypocritical to me. But, there is reason to believe crypto isn’t really backed by anything (at least nothing tangible). I think we can say certain cryptos like Bitcoin (among many others) are no different than the dollar in that they are backed up by faith. However, in the case of Bitcoin (and many other currencies) it is backed by the community. 

Let me know your thoughts and if I’m missing anything or if I got anything wrong. Still learning here. Thanks!"
CryptoCurrency,"NFTS? The market is booming for them! What is your favorite and why ? I'll go first: Curio Cards

First ever art NFT on ETH.

""Curio Cards are one of the very first implementations of collectible tokens on the Ethereum blockchain — even earlier than Moon Cat Rescue and CryptoPunks.

The project was created by Travis Uhrig, Thomas Hunt, and Rhett Creighton, launching on May 9, 2017. It consisted of a continuous “digital art show” which spanned 4 months, showcasing a total of 30 collectible digital Curio Cards from a total of seven different digital artists.""

This is why Curio cards are getting some huge attention right now ! They went from not even the top 100 in sales on Open Sea for the past 7 days to they are now top 10 with 1205 ETH sold and that was basically all done in the last four days.

In fact, they are gaining so much popularity, Businessman/ Influencer Gary vee has just went HARD buying over 100 ETH worth of cards and he hasn't even begun telling others about it besides a few small tweets replying to others. The other person he replied to was President of NBA team the 76ers,Daryl Morey, who bought almost a full set which is going for over 170 ETH so far as well the last time I checked!

Honestly, Curio Cards are a piece of history as the predate CryptoPunks which are selling for an a floor of 30 ETH and thats their biggest selling point. "" Wee are the first ever NFTs on Ethereum."" I love CryptoPunks but the truth is they are not and never were the first NFT but you can get some curio cards right now for .10- 1 ETH which is 30x times the difference. 

The market is not doing well but the market for NFTs are doing much better and the fact this gaining steam and is being discovered as the true first NFT on ETH lets you knowt this has ALOT of room for growth.

Ill post more links in the comments if they allow them to stay up!

CryptoCurrency,"My Investing History It started with my dad. It’s important first to tell his experience with investing because I believe his experience shaped my views on investing today.

He immigrated to the US from Chile as a teenager looking for work and better opportunities. The family back Chile was living off his mom’s Air Force paycheck (a few hundred bucks a month if that) because his dad was out of a job for years. On such a low paycheck they could not afford to buy my dad a plane ticket to the US. So he saved up for more than 3 years selling anything he could. He sold shoes, trading cards, he hosted parties in his home, sold candy, delivered newspapers, and when the Air Force sent his mom over to the US to consult with the embassy in DC he brought back a walkman (portable CD player), denim jeans and jackets, and plenty of other things that you could never find in his country at that time.

Once he saved up enough money he bought himself a plane ticket and flew to the DC area. Took a few years but he met my mom, worked his ass off while initially living in my grandparent’s basement and eventually got promoted to regional manger of a chain of hotels. 

Some time before the recession in 2008 he got into buying and selling homes. Eventually, we were able to build a beach house in Wilmington, South Carolina. The times spent at the beach house were some of the most enjoyable times in my life as a kid. The journey up to the time we bought the beach front property wasn’t pretty though.

My parents struggled with debt. They would consistently max out their credit cards before they had kids by spending it on vacations. By the time they had me and my brother they had to file for bankruptcy and wait 5 years before they could get another loan. Yet, quite ironically, this 5 year period was when my dad started buying and selling homes. He rebuilt his credit this way and built his investment empire right up to the point when we built the beach house. 

Things were going great for my family. We had multiple homes, 300 grand in our bank account, and a lot of respect from my extended family. Then it came time to refinance the ARM (adjustable rate mortgage) in 2008 we got for the beach house. He went to the bank and they refused to finance it. He went to another and they refused as well. Turns out, no bank at that time was refinancing or handing out new loans. The market crash had begun. 

We sold all our homes at a loss, almost lost the home we lived in, and the hotel that my dad worked for went into bankruptcy and laid him off. He went through a series of attempts to reinvent himself from selling courses on home buying, to starting a cleaning business, to selling insurance. 

In my high school years I saw my dad go back to Chile to start a business. He started a teeth whitening business, sold that one to his employees, and then started a marketing firm that got quite successful and was valued in the millions. I was quite inspired by him so I visited Chile several times to travel and to work in his business packing merchandise, operating the printing machines for logos, installing the internet in the office, updating the computers, delivering packages with his driver, visiting our vendors to purchase products in bulk, and a slew of other things. 

Unfortunately, a recession in Chile, coupled with overspending in the business and some operational mismanagement led to a decline in sales for several years. This was around the time I went to college and joined the military.

Fast-forward to 2019 the business was still reeling from the collateral damage of the recession in Chile. By that time I was introduced to Coinbase by my best friend. I thought it was a curious thing this cryptocurrency. So I threw in $60 to hopefully make some quick gains. Watched my holdings go up to $100 and crash back down to $30 in late 2019. I decided to keep holding since I still needed to recover my losses. I even added bitcoin to my holdings in February 2020.

But, when I saw the stock market crash in March I cashed everything out at a loss and bought Uber in the stock market. Then I bought Facebook, Microsoft, and a few others doubling my initial investment and then tripling by the end of 2020. My dad did the same thing as well but only after we sold our childhood home in February of 2020. We fell on hard times so we needed the cash. With that money my dad made a living trading on the stock market and made a killing while I just sat back and watched the show tripling my principal while sitting on my ass lol.

2021 came around and I heard about the dogecoin craze. I bought in on January but sold for a profit at around 8 cents because I was scared it might drop again. Then I wised up and committed fully to crypto. I bought a ledger nano and some bitcoin. Then later Ethereum, Cardano, Amp, and an assortment of free cryptos I got from Coinbase. I later learned about staking and other ways of earning crypto. 

In retrospect, if we hadn’t fallen on hard times throughout 2020 with my dad doing Uber to survive (while his girlfriend was operating the business in Chile) and me doing school and working to pay my own bills I likely would not have dropped into the stock market the way I did and subsequently crypto. This is the reason why the history of my dad’s business ventures is a good chunk of this post. It was such a formative series of ventures that bled into my life in good and bad ways.

I am now on my own business venture with crypto and the story of my family and my own life is what led me here. Feel free to share your stories as well. I’d love to hear them!"

CryptoCurrency,"Starting a Python-implemented portfolio manager with Coinbase Pro's API After a few weeks of run-n-gun crypto trading I decided to finally add some intelligence to my tactics. I started with Coinbase Pro in May, but unfortunately CbPro only shows users their current portfolio value and doesn't offer any management or tracking tools like a typical brockerage's online GUI would. From what I can tell, most Coinbase users subscribe to online portfolio managers to track their returns, generate charts, etc. 

This is a sensible move -- but I'm too stubborn and too curious for my own good. I decided to save money and learn a bit by spending absolutely way too much time learning about web API's and Coinbase Pro's API in particular. I'm now developing my own crypto portfolio management software in Python.

First thing I wanted to do is understand how the overall portfolio has performed. The most straightforward way I could think of was to divide the total portfolio value in USD per day since inception by the total amount of USD deposits made until then. This gives a simple ratio, where values greater than one mean the portfolio is worth more than the deposits, and values less than one mean the portfolio is worth less. Behold the fruits of my keyboard labor (the image I tried to attach -- I'm new to Reddit posting too, so bear with me please). 

The result paints a pretty dismal picture of my trading. My portfolio value has been in the red since the start of June and dipped as low as \~65 percent of my deposits. As of yesterday I've been sitting at about 80 percent. 

Anyways, developing this tool has me pretty excited and I wanted to share my start with y'all. If anyone has recommendations for free (or cheap!) crypto portfolio management software that offers tools a normal brokerage would, I'm all ears -- same goes for recommended analyses, charts, etc that I should tackle next.

The bull isn’t over!  You’re an imposter bear!
All black and brown, and covered with hair!

And in r/cryptocurrency, from here to there.
They denied the existence of the hairy bear!
Our alts have such uses!  And Bitcoin is so rare!
They shrieked and raged, in the summer air.
No bear! No bear!

Oh, painful it was, and so unfair!
The Portfolios dropping from here to there!
No fair! No fair! They said with despair
My shitcoins were rugged and my account’s now bare!

The bear smelled the scent on the summer air.
And FUDded all the newbies with some wyckoff flair!
And fearful sells the whales did ensnare!

The bear ran wild from here to there!
He sniffed and roared and snarled and glared!
And the market? Why he took the Lion’s share.

The coiners pointed at a cave.  “Please return to there!”
How we tire of dealing with such an awful bear!
A bear! A bear!
Oh how we despise the hair bear!

The bear, the bear!
He pulled up a chair!
The bear! The bear!

I quite like it here, I’ll go nowhere!
Said the bear, the bear
All black and brown and covered with hair

They sniffed and sighed,
And wailed in despair
Their coins kept falling 
Their wallets were bare!

Then at last they accepted their newfound bear
Our bear! They sang.  Our bear so fair!
We’ll DCA until you go back there!
And DCA they did, from here to there.
During the bear, the bear of the market unfair."
CryptoCurrency,"Advice on DCA? Hey guys! New to crypto. I’m looking to start DCA in both BTC &amp; ETH, and had a few questions. 

What do you guys think is the best platform to purchase on? Ideally paying as little in fees as possible. 

This may a dumb question. I plain on buying weekly. Is there a certain day/ time ideal for buying or does that not matter?

Lastly Should I purchase a hard wallet? I’ve heard using sites like coinbase, Binance, etc for storage is unsafe. However since I won’t be buying THAT much. I am unsure if it’s even worth it to buy one, and then on top of that pay more fees to transfer.

CryptoCurrency,So will ethereum prices go up if NFTs become more popular because they are on the blockchain? I sold my Bitcoin a while ago to look for a more solid crypto with long term potential. Ethereum seems great with it moving to proof of stake and allowing multiple tokens as well as contracts on the block chain. I am confused though on the ethereum coin though. Will the value of that be determined by the whole blockchain and everything on it like NFTs or is it separate.

CryptoCurrency,"Discussion: How does ADA actually compare to ETH/BNB? I would like to hear more about ADA and how it is going to work compared to Ethereum mainly. I have already learned a lot about it, but I just don't know how it is actually going to work against Ethereum or Binance smart chain. 

The main concern is that I have seen in the measly research I have been able to do on this topic, that moving a coin from Eth/Bsc is a lot harder than deploying a coin from Eth to Polygon or Bsc. 

Using the Bsc deployer for an Eth token is not hard to do mainly because of both Bsc and Eth use Solidity as it's programming language for Erc-20 and the Smart contracts. 

But ADA is using Haskell, which can be difficult for some people to learn, just so their token is present on one more chain.

CryptoCurrency,"Good read - Digital currency international central bank. I am not usually the type to read through a bunch of technical/research info but I found this recent paper easy to read and pretty informative.  If you have some time to waste I recommend it.  

https://www.bis.org/publ/othp38.pdf

Here is the summary of you were skeptical :)

Many central banks are currently investigating risks, benefits and various designs of CBDCs, but with a strong focus on domestic needs. Only a few central banks have made firm design choices so far. Implications of CBDCs, even if only intended for domestic use, will go beyond borders, making it crucial to coordinate work and find common ground. If coordinated successfully, the clean slate presented by CBDCs might – in time and in combination with other improvements – be leveraged to enhance cross- border payments.

This report has shown how CBDC could facilitate enhanced cross-border payments conceptually, and how efforts in practice are taking these considerations forward. The arrangements facilitating such payments imply different degrees of international integration and cooperation, ranging from basic compatibility with common standards to the establishment of international payment infrastructures. The analysis highlights both the need for multilateral collaboration and the importance of interoperability between CBDCs.

In order to achieve the potential benefits for public welfare while preserving financial stability, further exploration on CBDC design choices and their macro-financial implications is essential. Various important and complex questions are still to be further analysed, for instance as regards the interoperability between existing and new infrastructures, the access to and control of central bank money, the distinction between wholesale and retail CBDC, the role of private industry actors, and many others.

While CBDCs have unique features, enhancements in the other building blocks of the cross-border payments programme, such as aligning regulatory, supervisory and oversight frameworks for cross-border payments, AML/CFT consistency, PvP adoption and payment system access32 will be critical for cross-border CBDC use. This reinforces the importance of the overall G20 roadmap to comprehensively enhance cross-border payments. For example, the idea of encouraging interoperability between CBDCs has strong structural similarities to establishing links between the payment infrastructures of different countries and the investigation into the feasibility of new multilateral cross-border payment platforms.33 Also, the eventual international adoption of CBDCs is likely to proceed at different speeds in different jurisdictions, calling for interoperability with legacy payment arrangements. Hence, the subsequent action of this building block (19) calls, among others, for the analysis of interoperability with non-CBDC payment arrangements.34"
CryptoCurrency,"Convincing people about crypto We’ve all been through conversations with family/friends about crypto, where they just tell you that crypto is bad/way too risky/ shit investment etc.

CryptoCurrency,"Don't be reckless when you invest The Crypto market is always a very volatile place. If you are trying to get rich by dumping money that you cannot afford to lose (mortgaging your house, life savings, retirement funds ...) into the crypto space. Then all you are doing is rolling a dice in a Casino. 

You need to look at what you are investing and making sure you are not:   


1. Getting involved with shitcoins, or other altcoins you have heard a YouTuber talking about. You have to DYOR to be confident in your investment and with that, your mind will be at ease when there is a dip because you **know** what you have bought.
2. Being **blinded** by dreams of a getting rich quick scheme
3. Putting in money that you just **cannot afford to lose**.
4. Letting your **emotions** get the better of you. Such as panic selling and panic buying when the market is going up or down. 

It is important to note several important concepts in crypto when the prices are increasing. Such as the followings.  


1. Buying near ATHs, I myself have made this mistake. My emotions and FOMO got the better of me and I have learnt my lesson. Never again, **always buy low sell high**.
2. When there is a massive dip in the market, like the one we are experiencing currently. It is a good time to invest, but not all in one go. **DCA is the best way to go**, statistics have proven this to be the best approach. 
3. HODL, DCA and STAKING are your best friends

CryptoCurrency,"Ethereum 2.0 affect on Eth support coins like Matic, Uni, Link, etc.? Noob question: Curious what are the thoughts about Matic,  Uni, Link, Amp, and the plethora of other Ethereum support tokens out there (seems like the majority available on Coinbase), and how they will be affected by the 2.0 release?  Will they still be needed since Eth will now be POS and support more transaction than currently able to? 

Just seems like there are way too many of these Eth tokens out there, and while I understand some will just die off naturally, how many will receive an earlier than expected deathblow once 2.0 becomes available? Or does it not matter and may actually increase the value of many of these tokens?"

CryptoCurrency,"Lets share crypto-security tips Seeing stories like [this guy who lost 250k](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/oip4mi/if_you_want_to_join_me_in_watching_metamask/) reminded me of how security shoud be a top priority for all of us and I've seen here and there some cool tips and ideas and thought that we would all benefit from sharing them. So let us know  what are you crypto-security habits, in particular :

* what wallet (hot and cold) do you use and why 
* do you split your coins on multiple wallets
* any bad experience with an exchange / app / whatever
* how do you store safely your cold wallet if you have one
* how do you store safely your private key (I've seen someone talk about invisible ink and [this](https://safu.ninja/) which seem both good ideas)
* other general tips"
CryptoCurrency,"How bad of an idea is it to get a loan at a low interest rate and ""stake"" a Stablecoin? USDC offers very good interest rates of some exchanges, and from what I’ve seen (haven’t looked into it too much to be clear), it seems like people trust it overall. How risky is this and what potential problems would this cause?"
CryptoCurrency,"Crypto Scams getting out of Control So far this year, over $2.6 billion has been grabbed, according to Chainalysis, a New York-based blockchain researcher. That figure doesn’t include a giant Ponzi scheme that just came to light in South Africa. Local authorities put the haul at $3.6 billion worth of Bitcoin. Strangely enough, these numbers represent a decline from 2019, when fraudsters walked away with an estimated $9 billion.

The “very” bad news, however, is that there are more scams, and more people are getting stung. From 2019 to 2020, the number of victims jumped 48% to an estimated 7.3 million, a figure approaching the official population of Hong Kong. Between the last three months of 2020 and the first three months of 2021, the number of unique scams rose nearly 18%, to 1,335, according to Chainalysis.

**Please be careful what platforms you put your crypto on and what sites you share intimate details with.  Crypto is an unregulated financial space and it is swarming with swindlers and thieves looking to take your hard earned money.  Be advised, even if you report your crypto stolen, most government/local authorities ignore all reports under $100,000."

CryptoCurrency,"World Governments Will Outlaw Stablecoins And Force You To Use CBDCs, That Day Will Be The Doom Of Crypto China is not messing around. It really wants people to use digital yuan and dump all of their public crypto. And we all know USA nowadays just follow whatever China does. For example, when China introduced mass surveillance program to control its citizens, the US believed it was a good idea to adopt the same thing (that's why they cooperate with Facebook and Twitter to control people's speech).

And now, we all see the same current trend with crypto. China, Malaysia, and several other countries are crushing crypto mining activities in the name of ""climate change"". and as we all know the democrats and Joe Biden are overly-obsessed with climate change, so for sure they will also try to crush crypto, tax crypto wealth to death, and then suddenly come up with their own CBDCs. 

And to those who say Bitcoin cannot be destroyed by one government, it actually is very possible. They only need to arrest Tether founders and the whole market will collapse. They just dont want to do that right now because Biden administration has other priorities. But i'm telling you it's very easy for his government to crush crypto and he will do it since Biden is basically another puppet that will do anything to uphold dollar supremacy"

CryptoCurrency,"Anyone here mine with their gaming laptop? I see extremely little discussion from those who mine themselves and I'm very curious. Anyone here use a shitty PC/Laptop to mine? I'm curious on the process too, I want to kinda learn the mining process for when I finally buy a good gaming rig. I know the money is going to essentially be nothing, but I'm at work for 9 hours a day and don't pay for my power so I figured I might as well do something with my setup.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm also of the belief that anything mined today could easily be worth 5 times its value in 5 years. I've read stories of people who mined hundreds of thousands DOGE on their shitty laptop back in 2015-16 but that same person also lost access to that wallet. Again I'm not expecting any money at all from this tbh, I just want to get started learning for if I ever want to start mining on the side one day. Right now I have a laptop that's basically on par with the PS4 Pro.

&amp;#x200B;

CryptoCurrency,"Have a trusted source for crypto news or crypto predictions? Here’s how to test their accuracy. If you have a few favorite crypto YouTubers, or like to look at price predictions on FXStreet or InvestingCube, put their TA and other predictions to the test. 

First, listen closely to what they are saying. There are so many YouTubers that cover all their bases if you pay attention. Make a checklist. Did they say the price might go up? Yes. Did they say the price might go down? Yes. Did they say there’s a big possibility it might dump, followed by a big pump? Yes. Did they say it could trade sideways for a while longer? Yes. So many of them predict all of the above in every video. Your confirmation bias picks what it wants to hear and goes with that and suddenly, your favorite YouTuber looks like a genius, or at least makes you feel good. They are also able to cherry-pick moments from their past videos to say “I called it!” down the road even though they called out literally every possibility. They post a bunch of bullish videos and suddenly the market takes a huge dump and their next videos all say “I was saying this might happen back in March…” because, yes, of course they mentioned it in a video, however briefly it may have been. 

As for all those articles posted predicting future price action? Look back a few weeks or a few months, or even a year, at their old predictions and you can see they are all just throwing shit at a wall to see what sticks. Look at their post history. 9 times out of 10, articles are written that say a different thing every few days or every other week. Again, they can cherry-pick the articles that were close to right to show just how accurate they were. 

Moral of the story? Take everything you read or watch with a grain of salt. Nobody really knows what will happen next. Some try to provide educated guesses, but almost all try to phrase what they say and how they say it, and then post so frequently that eventually they get a few things right. Remain skeptical and don’t fall into a trap because you yourself are cherry-picking the things you want to hear or seeking out the bullish articles that make you feel good. They all project such confidence, yet are basing all their predications on a very new emerging technology, evolving rapidly, and changing daily with so few market cycles, you can rarely predict what will happen next. What will happen next? The only thing I know for sure is that no one knows."

I have Lots of questions/ideas.. 

Considering ISO 20022 it seems this change is inevitable… opportunistic.. and EXCITING! Coming from a small school of under 2,000 kids.. lots of terrific minds in the area. 

It would be a very participant run club.. no designated “leader” or “teacher” 

Would love to integrate the free available course called blockchain and money, instructed Gary Gensler a few years ago.. would love it to find a slimmed down version of that to save time. Have lots of other ideas.. interoperability seems key! Schools don’t teach credit/money management/or anything about the organizations/federal agencies that run our economy. I think it wouldn’t be too hard to manage a positive educational environment. It’s essential that the coming generations accurately understand the 4th industrial revolution. It’s already beginning.

2) surely gas prices rise with ETH, unless I’m confused, and isn’t this a bad thing.

CryptoCurrency,"I genuinely hate my bank Hello, and welcome to my TED Talk about how my bank really tried, and succeeded, in making me angry.

It all starts when I wanted to invest a sum of 15$ in Doge when it was still 0.03$ on Binance. To my disappointment, my card was declined several times so I gave up. The next day my bank called me but I didn't know it was their number and I was partying with my friends so I didn't pick up. A few hours later I realised that my card had been locked, so on my way back from my friend I visisted my bank to have my card unlocked. It turned out that they permanently locked it and there was nothing to be done exept open a new account with a new card. Thats what they said at least. In the end, I didn't invest in Doge at 0.03$.

I think you can understand my frustration when my friend (who didn't know about my crypto adventures) sent me screens of Doge hitting new highs literally every week. Then I forgot about it for a while before I checked the charts again. Doge was 0.55$ per coin. I was FUMING. I tried to buy Doge again, and my card declined AGAIN. So I decided to try again tomorrow. And tomorrow morning Doge was worth 0.71$. I WAS LIVID. In frustration and anger i tried to buy Doge again until my bank called me to ask how dare was I to invest in the crypto market and if anyone forced me to do it. After this annoying conversation they let me do it. I FOMO'd all in into this thing right before the SNL and you can tell what happened.

I know that my bank is not at fault for my financial decisions, but it was my money and I should be able to spend it how the hell I want. It was a mistake, but it was mine to make! And when i think about my possible gains from the 0.03$ Doge... this thought couldn't leave me alone!

Fast forward to june. I was a wiser young adult now, partially because I joined this sub. I transferred my crypto from Binance to Coinbase Pro and swapped all of my Doge into Bitcoin an Eth. And I decided to invest a little mmore, usibg the DCa method of course. So this time, instead of using my card I tried to make a SEPA transfer. Shortly after my bank calls me. They try to prevent me from doing it again, and I have to explain myself to them AGAIN. Fortunately, it went through this time. When I tried to use my card when there was notime to wait for the SEPA to go through i tried using my card. It worked, but only after i had to manually unlock my card using the banks app a couple of times before it went through. Basically every tranfer was pain. And I was still salty about Doge.

They were also calling me at least once a day asking if I wanted to take a loan until I blocked their number.

But the thing that really pushed me over the edge happened only a few days ago. It is not about crypto, but involves coins. I tried to buy a special set of collectors coins from Royal Australian Mint. I was really suprised when my card declined. They locked it, of course and after I manually unlocked it using the app and tried to complete the purchase again before they locked it almost for good. I had to wait for them to contact me before I could do anything about it. They said m purchase was ""suspicious"". I was baffled. It wasn't even crypto, but just some special aussie coins! Pople buy stuff from other side of the world from various sites all the time! I did it all the time! How was this considered suspicious? The whole set was worth 15AUD! Its not like I was buying an expensive yacht! Just let me spend my money in peace bank!

In conclusion, I hate that my bank treats my money hostage for any purchase I try to make. I hate that I have to explain to them that yes, people spend their money in some unusual places sometimes and it is completely normal! It almost feels like I have been deemed somewhat dangerous by them! I'm considering switching banks, though I fear every single one is the same and they will lock my card just the same. Still, it cost me a lot of nerves to make even the smallest purchase and I'm a little fed up with all of this.

And thats all. By writing this post I'm leaving this stuff behind and I'm hopeful that there are green days waiting for me in the future. Thank you for listening to my TED Talk, and fuck the banks."

CryptoCurrency,"Everybody Who Claims They Are Lucky To Buy In This Bear Market Is Dellusional - Here's Why It baffles me how some users here claimed that they are lucky to buy crypto at current price and they even justified buying at bear market will make them rich. Here's why these people are absolutely dellusional.

First of all, bear market does not finish in just 2-3 months, it typically last for more than a year. So, if we truly are in bear market, that means the current price depression will continue for at least the next 8-9 months. And you know what that means? That means BTC can easily go back to below $20,000 before it bounces back and ETH might go below $1,000 before it bounces back. Now imagine if ETH goes down to $900, would you feel stupid buying at $1,900? Perhaps you will.

So, yes, all those dellusional people who believe the bear market is here should stop being contradictive with themselves. If we are truly in bear market, that means we will go much lower than current price point, since bear market does not end within just 2-3 months!"
CryptoCurrency,"Thoughts on the Play 2 Earn (P2E) Gaming model that´s currently thriving in the crypto ecosystem ***What is play to earn?***

Hi! To everyone who doesn´t know **what Play 2 Earn is**. Basically, it´s a revolution in the gaming industry, where the users (players) are rewarded with NFTs or Cryptocurrencies for investing their time and/or money in to a game which they can later capitalize on if they wish to.

&amp;#x200B;

***What is the state of the gaming industry as a whole? Is it profitable?***

 On 2020, the gaming market generated about $177 billion in revenue with a growth of 23% from the year before. Reports estimate it to be about 170-200 billion dollars at the moment, and predict it will grow to $280-$320 billion dollars by 2026. In addition to that, it´s currently worth more than the film and music industry and will keep growing at a higher rate than them.

 Netflix in its quarterly earnings report for January 2019 stated that Fortnite may be a bigger threat to its business than HBO which was starting its own streaming service to rival Netflix. But with tens of millions of gamers ranging from kids to adults playing Fortnite and similar Battle Royale games, Netflix has admitted that it no longer views companies providing TV content and video streaming services as its only competition. And they should be worried because online gaming has shifted the attention of their consumer base away from TV shows and movies.

Right now, the **mobile** **gaming** industry is the one growing the most because of the increasing use of smartphones. It contains lots of games with ""microtransactions"" and incentives for people to open the app regularly and lots of adds to earn money from. This, among other things, makes it the most profitable section.

&amp;#x200B;

***How are Blockchains and Cryptocurrencies related to Video Games?***

The crypto gaming scene combines decentralized/Peer to Peer economies and public information regarding the execution of protocols (**smart contracts**) and money flow of organizations, with the concept of **player** **driven** **economies** which is popular in the **videogame industry.** 

&amp;#x200B;

***How do player driven economies work?***

Well, let’s say you buy / earn (by investing your time) an item which gives you an advantage, cosmetic upgrade, or has some kind of **value** in a game or project's metaverse. In most traditional video game companies, both the money you spend and the time you use to get these objects of value, doesn´t give you any, or at most, little monetary returns unless you compete at a high level, create content on social platforms or sell items for FIAT currencies illegally which demands a lot of work and time.

&amp;#x200B;

***What value does the Play to Earn model give to the gaming industry?***

The **Play** **to** **Earn** model comes to revolutionize gaming. Developers are making games and metaverses, with economies similar to well-established games of different genres including cryptocurrencies, blockchains and NFT´s in to them.

Some implement economic systems with aspects of EVE Online´s, World of Warcraft, Mu Online, RuneScape, Second Life, etc. where players themselves generate resources and have different professions such as vendors, resources gatherers, raiders/monster killers or engineers. Only that now, these objects are given to them in the form of NFTs or token rewards that they can store in their own private wallet.

Others are more lineal and consist of NFT´s staking with extra steps and a marketplace for the assets. One of the most successful projects in that area is “Crypto Blade”.

In addition to those, there are many Trading Card Games (TGC) such as Unchained Gods and Splinterlands, two famous titles in the crypto-gaming space which let users buy/sell and trade their cards.

Players are **capitalizing on their time/money spent on a game** by having **true** ownership of the assets they get. Although, this works as long as there's a healthy economical ecosystem. There is always the possibility that a mismanaged project crashes leaving it´s community with huge losses.

Even though these systems seem promissing, there will be many games that'll fail to succeed. Some projects will likely suffer from rug pulls and exploits. We are talking about an industry that´s developing applications using cutting edge technology.  It\`s up to the devs decisions and the community/market to decide what games triumph with a well-planned economy and engaging aspects besides money-making to ensure a healthy environment and player base in the space.

&amp;#x200B;

***What is the state of this section of the gaming industry?***

Currently, many projects are popping up, and getting a lot of adoption quickly. You could say that the Crypto Gaming scene is on its own bull run right now.

The most profitable crypto game and the **#1 revenue generating application in the entire crypto industry** is **“Axie Infinity”**, a game which combines unique NFTs with a playstyle that combines many elements of different games like Pokémon, and Hearthstone/Hearthstone Battlegrounds. The developers make money mostly by charging a 4.25% Market fee on Axie Sales on their native marketplace and a few other things. In the last 30 days, the marketplace sales generated $420 million dollars in Wrapped Ethereums (221000 ETH). 

Users mine SLP and in some cases AXS, the tokens used in Axie´s ecosystem. SLP (Smooth Love Potions) are used to breed new Axies by using two of them, and AXS is a governance token for the community to have weight in the decisions for the future of the game. It´s used to reward the top 300 players in the PvP ladder when seasons end. 

With the deployment of Ronin, their own blockchain, for their assets due to the game being previously played on Ethereum, they multiplied their daily users from about 10k to more than 500k in months. On the Ronin chain, users can claim SLP, breed and buy / sell their Axies on a feeless blockchain (for up to 100 transactions every 24hs).

In the game, you fight using 3 Axies, which are creatures of 9 different classes that have 6 parts which determines it´s 4 attacks and also give stats and other 2 which only provide stats. There are many combinations and cross-classes axis and an interesting PvP meta which is rebalanced and updated regularly. Also, there are PvE matches, which take from 4 hours at the beginning to about 2 hs after a few weeks in to the game. For doing all of this, you get SLP, the game´s token that is required to breed a pair of axies to create a new one that inherits their genes. There are going to be lands and other new aspects of the game and Metaverse that are in developing right now.

Crypto Blades is drawing a lot of attention as well. It´s token, Skill, is trading at about $25, with a growth of 25.000% since 18/7 when it was going for $1.25. The game is played by making your characters use weapons to fight with a selected enemy by signing a transaction on BSC by paying a fee, and receiving SKILL (the in-game currency) as a reward if they win, if they lose the fight (which rarely happens) they don´t get anything. Players can fight up to 7 times a day with each character and they can have 4 of them for each BSC wallet they use to play. There are 5 classes of characters/weapons that are created for a small amount of SKILL which add some gameplay to the experience. At the moment, Crypto Blade´s ROI is high, with players earning from $50 to thousands on a daily basis. It´s not against the rules to play multiple accounts but users can´t use bots to do it for them. They are going to release many features such as lands and raids also, so they have a long roadmap ahead.

There haven´t been AAA titles (games produced and distributed by a [mid-sized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_publisher#Mid-size_publishers) or [major publisher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_publisher#Major_publishers)) in the Crypto gaming space **up to now**. Most of the games developed in the recent years are poor in design/complexity and aren´t really that entertaining or innovative at all gameplaywise. There have been some like Axie Infinity and Crypto Kitties which did amazing things, though, most of them weren´t and there is a bigger userbase now with more money to poor in to these economies.

This year Is different, we are at the start of something big. Money is flowing into this industry now. At this moment, there are AAA game projects being developed containing **player driven economies,** such as, Illuvium and Guild of Guardians, two promising projects with great teams conformed by high quality professionals.

Also, all across the space there are major investors such as Ubisoft, Samsung, Binance, Moto GP, and others. There are lots of eyes here, this is a revolution in gaming and it´s quite profitable.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

***How I think the space would react to a possible bear market***

Right now, with BTC at almost 50% down from its ATH, the gaming market is growing tremendously. I personally believe that crypto and gaming will keep growing together, even during a bear market (at a much slower pace, and not every project will survive).

Mostly because, during past bear markets, there has historically been little liquidity in comparison to bull seasons giving that the trading of this kind of assets was made in its majority to earn money or move it around in different ways that weren´t so interactive and fun as computer games.

What if good games with an interesting playstyle and player driven economies are able to retain a healthy amount of liquidity during a bear season because they have a reliable player base who truly enjoys playing besides thinking only about the money involved? Users spend huge amounts on projects that keep delivering new content such as WoW, LoL, CS:GO, and many others. 

This market is still really young and a slight separation of game economies from BTC and other trending coins would be healthy and show a “more matured” space. **I´m not at all saying that it will happen now or that the space is mature enough** for this scenario to become a reality**.** My opinions are based on the information I have and how I would like the industry to evolve. When the bear market comes, lots of gaming projects will die out and in a severe case maybe almost none of them survives. **We have no precedents to study from so it´s all based on speculation.**

I would love to know what you think about all of this UwU

CryptoCurrency,"Advice for a new investor So I was one of those who got drawn into crypto in March this year. 
I bought small amounts of theta, xrp, algo and vet thinking an alt coin would make me rich. Obviously that didn’t work out. But I haven’t lost a lot, but I am now a HODLer

After losing a bit of interest, I’ve read a bit more these last few days and reading multiple times that in these times, are when people lay the foundations for the next bull market.

So now I’m here. I’ve got a few alts, not many, but Im not sure if I would want to buy any more of them.

If I DCA what I can afford in Bitcoin or ethereum, because they are the most established, let’s say £25 a week. Despite not being much, that would put me in a decent position in say 3 years?

Or should I be looking at getting more into the Alts where I can stake?

I also make a mistake of buying these coins and then putting them in the exodus wallet on my phone. So I have to pay fees to move anything around. Again, not clever and a mistake I’ll learn from.

Any advice appreciated!

CryptoCurrency,"Take a proper care of your mental health. It’s far more valuable than anything else I know, another post about the mental health but hear me out, please.

As most of you already know, we’re living in a society that values money. We will do many things for it and sometimes it may result in sacrificing our mental health. This can be a subversive process that is hard to catch in the moment. The absolute paradox of value and money is that the very thing you chase can be the thing that destroys you. Unfortunately, I have chased money on several occasions and in parallel sacrificed relationships, time and most importantly, my mental health. I've lost sleep, jeopardized relationships and undermined my own ethics far too many times to count.
Although my relationship with money has evolved, in my early days I was specifically obsessed about these 3 things:

1.    Not having enough
2.    My friends doing better than me
3.    Others doing better than me

I also started asking these questions:

1.    Do I lose sleep over my crypto positions? (Yes)
2.    Can I go a day without checking the market? (No)
3.    How do I feel when I lose? (Like shit, of course, what did you expect)
 
I realized I have a big problem. My investing habits were destroying my life. After weeks of thinking I came up with these points to get me back on track:
 
1.    Staying away from social media or at least reducing it by a wide margin

2.    Not reading news in the evenings before bed
 
3.    Leaving my phone in another room when I went to sleep.

4.    Taking at least 1 full day per week totally away from all screens, phone, laptop, desktop and otherwise and hitting the mountains

5.    Trading far less.  When I trade less and look at the screen less, I tend to make more money.

Right now, I’m doing way better and I’m really thankful for that. I hope some of you might find it useful. Success has nothing to do with how much money you have, it's about the relationship you have with money, people and yourself. If you become paranoid and build a shelter based on fear and obsession - even if you get rich financially you will be the most depressed person alive. 

Good luck out there!"

CryptoCurrency,"Coinbase Card So I’m excited. I put my self on the waitlist for the Coinbase card. Finally got off the waitlist and received the card in the mail today. In addition to that I also applied for a rewards card from Capital One. So now I’m in a bit of a dilemma. If I use the credit card then I can build my credit history, improve my credit score further, and get 1.5% cash back. If use the Coinbase card I get 4% back on Stellar Lumens (one of my favorite cryptos) or 1% on Bitcoin and I get to use crypto with any purchase which was always my dream since I entered the crypto space.

I wonder which one I should use. If I’m going to use my Coinbase card for expenses like food then the idea would be to deposit $400 per month (more or less) and use that while getting 4% back on stellar. Problem is that stellar, just like any crypto, fluctuates on a daily basis. I would need to deposit say 20% more to account for a possible 20% drop on price. Good thing is that I have the option to deposit USDC but there are no rewards for that as I’ve seen.

Or I could opt to use my credit card. Price of the dollar is stable, I get 1.5% cash back that I can use to pay down my balance and put towards other rewards, and I get to further improve my credit score. Seems like the more attractive option to me honestly.

A third option: I could use both. Just divide expenses between the two. But for now, other than the excitement of using crypto, it seems more financially beneficial for me to use my credit card.

What does everyone think? Does anyone here use the Coinbase card for anything?"

So basically i always pictured it as an Al Pacino movie where he starts at the bottom and keeps mowing everyone and every organisation and Mafia group to become the one and only drug lord and master :)

but technically 
DeFi is short for “decentralized finance,” an umbrella term for a variety of financial applications in cryptocurrency or blockchain geared toward DISRUPTING financial intermediaries.

DeFi draws inspiration from blockchain, the technology behind the digital currency bitcoin, which allows several entities to hold a copy of a history of transactions, meaning it isn’t controlled by a single, central source. That’s important because centralized systems and human gatekeepers can limit the speed and sophistication of transactions while offering users less direct control over their money. DeFi is distinct because it expands the use of blockchain from simple value transfer to more complex financial use cases.

Bitcoin and many other digital-native assets stand out from legacy digital payment methods, such as those run by Visa and PayPal, in that they remove all middlemen from transactions. When you pay with a credit card for coffee at a cafe, a financial institution sits between you and the business, with control over the transaction, retaining the authority to stop or pause it and record it in its private ledger. With bitcoin and more importantly ETH those institutions are cut out of the picture.

So, now give me your version of DeFi,  Ive seen some hillarious descriptions of it in here."

CryptoCurrency,"UPDATED 1 Month Review Crypto.com Visa Card as an european - no brainer and worth reading Hello guys,

i wanted to do an updated review after using my [crypto.com](https://crypto.com) visa card (ruby) as a daily driver for a month:

My original post can be found here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/o8tj4c/as\_a\_european\_a\_cryptocom\_visa\_card\_honest\_review/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/o8tj4c/as_a_european_a_cryptocom_visa_card_honest_review/)

In my linked post ive talked about alternatives pros and cons and the reason i went for crypto.com

**TLDR**  As germany doesnt offer any decent credit / debit card with cashback besides Amazon if u are a heavy shopper. I decided to go into the cryptosphere and binance and [crypto.com](https://crypto.com) are the only decent one available (Still waiting on maybe NEXO).  Decided for the [crypto.com](https://crypto.com) ruby (Why? Check my linked post)

\+ 2% Cashback

\+ 10,63 Cashback in Spotify

\+ Premium feeling metal card

\- u have to stake 350 Euro worth their Currency without interests

\- Cashback in CRO (Can be swapped in any Currency details below)

\- Debit Card u always have to top it up. Takes usually 24h until SEPA arrives

&amp;#x200B;

1 Month with my [crypto.com](https://crypto.com) ive also followed them a bit more. They got some really nice partnerships. One is Formula 1 the other is UFC (If im not mistaken UFC is a 10 years deal.) Im sure this will be a huge way to get more people into crypto. 

Topping up my card usually is no hassle and i just use a template which takes 15 seconds to send the SEPA transfer and 24h til it arrives. I use CURVE as an APP so i can use my Card virtually. All in all my cards works fine virtually and physical. I had a few payments issues in super small shops like backeries and thats why i just carry my regular bank card (i could also use google pay linked to my bank account).

&amp;#x200B;

So far i got regular cashback worth 4 Euros, and additional 4 Euros for normal spendings (Fly ticket, new wallet...) - In germany using my bankcard would gain my zero money back (!)

Cashback is like payback it is instant. 

Ive changed my payment plan in spotify and also received my spotify cashback instantly. Super rat.

I also recommended the ruby card to a few communities on reddit and gained referal money.

&amp;#x200B;

All in all i can say im super happy that im an early adopter to it. I have a set limit to spend money on crypto and i dont wanna increase it. With the cashback and spotify im able to put an extra amount of 15 Euros in crypto every month, for basicly free. Only risk is staking their CRO Coins, but as in every alt coin it can be risky.

&amp;#x200B;

Hit me up for any further questions!

I'll probably stop buying until im financially free."

CryptoCurrency,"Why would I want to pay for goods with something like Bitcoin considering it’s value will most likely continue to increase in time? I completely understand why people would want places to accept crypto for payment.

Why not just use something like a stable coin instead to pay for goods?"
CryptoCurrency,"How to do your own research So I recently made a post asking what you guys like to do when doing your own research for a coin you are interested in. Why do we need to do our own research? Well one big reason is because shilling is very common practice and is done in attempt to positively increase the price of a coin, knowing what you are buying from an unbiased opinion is very important. So to try to help some beginners, I'm going to summarize some of the key points of areas to look at when doing your own research.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Read the White Paper - Arguably one of the most important source for solid information on a project is the White Paper. The White Paper is normally quite technical and long and can be difficult to understand but essentially a white paper is used to describe a problem the project is trying to solve as well as solutions to said problem. The White Paper can also include things like the roadmaps, how funds will be used (important) and the team behind the project. I highly recommend giving the BTC white paper a read also to give you a feel.
2. Research the Team -  Is the team anonymous? If so then do they have a good reason to be? BTC's Satoshi Nakamoto was anonymous and many people believe it is what made BTC able to grow organically without a single figure of authority. However, nowadays an anonymous team is usually not a good sign as many rug pull and scams can occur without anyone being held liable due to anonymity. Always use extreme caution investing in a project with an anonymous team. 
3. Look at the Tokenomics -  Tokenomics is the understanding of the supply and demand characteristics of a cryptocurrency.  We've all seen the shitcoins with a quadrillion supply talking about burning and promises of getting to that sweet sweet 1$ price tag. If you know anything about market cap you know its simply not possible. Dogecoin has an infinite supply and the hopes behind this is essentially that it will be able to maintain a stable price later on in its life, however, we have no idea if this will be the case and is another thing to consider. On the other hand we have BTC with a finite supply of 21,000,000 created via mining. The number of coins decreases by half every four years essentially creating a scarcity driving prices up. One last thing to note is how much of the supply is held by whales and the devs.
4. Social Media - Look them up on social media and check how active they are.  If they are only posting scarcely and have low community interaction  you should do more research as to why this, is it a dead project? 
5. Github (This one is a little more technical) -  A good project goes a long way, but not all work done are made equal. It's important to have a project in the works.

CryptoCurrency,"IF we are expecting to see a similar cycle to 2017/2018 (big if), here is what to expect... OK, so obviously I need to start this with the disclaimer of nobody knows shit about shit that's gonna happen, BUT, there is also a lot of talk on this sub about double peak bull runs, and in general people seem to think we might have seen a replay of the 2017 peak with and expected 2018 style bump before hitting the true bear market. Obviously there are all sorts of reasons why this wont happen exactly the same and TA is pretty much all bullshit, but things are boring right now so lets play with some ""what ifs"".  

So, looking back at history, if we repeat ourselves exactly, this is what to expect.:

Summer of 2017, Bitcoin was trading around $3400 USD. By early December it reached a peak around $13,000 before dropping to roughly 50% over the next ~4 months. In the spring, BTC got a bit of a second wave and made its way back up to around $7500 in the summer of 2018, and then  crash  over the  fall and winter of  2018 before revisiting  around the $3500 level in the spring of 2019.


If we assume that our preamble to this bullrun was back in the summer /fall of 2020 when BTC was trading around $10,000, our peak of $60,000 this spring  then led to our current price  around $30,000. While the peak this time around was ~6x the preamble vs the 2017 rate of 4x, the current drop is still about  50% which matches  up nicely with the early 2018 drop.  Since our peak was a bit higher this year  we may still have  a bit more dipping to go before the real bounce, but if it does happen in roughly the same manner we might expect to see bitcoin hitting around  $45,000 this fall/winter before dropping back down to around  $10,000 at the lowest of lows in late 2022 sometime.


Clearly this is all bullshit, but its been fun loosely comparing this and last bullrun, so thanks if you actually got this far."

CryptoCurrency,"It it really reasonable to say that the bitcoin cap is 21 million? People always say that bitcoin has an eventual cap of 21 million, and while this is strictly true, doesn't the decimalization of bitcoin make for an unreasonable comparison? If you look at USD it has 2 decimal places (well 4 in accounting but the smallest units is a cent, which is two decimal places) while BTC has 8.

I put it to you that if BTC were considered from the same decimalization as USD (so 100 satoshis is a whole unit), there would actually be a cap for 21 trillion whole units with 900 million units minted on average per day.

I'm not specifically saying anything with this, I just thought it would make an interesting discussion. Is it fair to compare currencies while using different decimal scales? And would increasing the number of decimal places (something being considered for the future of BTC) have a similar economic effect to currency printing?"

CryptoCurrency,"If this is a bear market, it'll be my third. Here's what I wish I'd done in the first two. **Backup everything**

* **Exchange Info, get your crypto off the exchanges if you can. (Go lookup Cryptopia, Bitgrail and MtGox if you don't know why)**
* **and keep every email.**

It might not happen today, this week or even in the next year, but if this is the bear market you're going to lose interest and forget about a lot of things.

In 2014 when the bear came I cashed out roughly half of what I'd been mining and forgot about crypto for a couple of years. Then when I got interested again I couldn't remember shit. I found most of my wallet seeds written down in a notebook.

What I couldn't find though was the seed to [this wallet with 0.05 BTC in it.](https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/18cNTbaDBjC6373M2QcKXusNfyBGYaGc3P?page=1) A relatively small amount in the grand scheme of things, but still enough to piss me off. It's not as if I have the blockchain address bookmarked and I look at it all the time though.

Then in 17/18 it went fucking insane, the ICO mania absolutely had my pants down. I ended up with a decent stash of the top coins but then probably 50+ shitcoins.

Again, the bear came and everyone forgot about crypto and I definitely didn't learn my lesson. Cryptopia getting hacked rekt me and the majority of the other ICO tokens died within a couple of months.

Then in 2020 we go again and yet again I cant remember shit. I'd done a bit better this time as I had most of my stash on a Trezor and a lot of things backed up in a password manager, but there is definitely some crypto with my name on it floating around the universe all lonely.

CryptoCurrency,"Why Binance Staking is not as good as it seems I've never been a huge proponent of ""not your keys not your crypto""; I've held crypto on various exchanges since 2015, and I've lost less than a dollar in total on cryptsy thus far (knock on wood). 

A month and a half ago, I saw super lucrative rates for staking on Binance (like 43% for MATIC), and decided to give it a try.

But now, after trying it out for a month and a half or so, I've realized that it's not nearly as good as it seems.

**- You get tempted to buy coins you don't believe in**

I didn't even buy any ""shitcoins"". All the coins I bought were legit; MATIC, DOT, KSM... Even so, and despite being a veteran in crypto since 2014, I should have known better than to buy coins I didn't believe in. Not only is it a bad financial decision, it's also bad psychologically because you get more nervous during dips; I've held my VET from 30k down to 1k back in 2018 and I didn't even bat an eye because I believed in the project. But every drop on a coin you don't believe in really hurts.

**- Your APY is not nearly as high as it seems**

This is the big one. The above would be fine if it wasn't for this. First of all, if you don't actually have the coin and have to buy it, you incur a fee for exchanging whatever coins you do have into it. And then you incur another fee when you exchange it back to BTC or USDT. You might even have to incur double the fees if you were switching from another coin like I did (VET to USDT to MATC/DOT/KSM etc), and if you wanted to switch it out back to say ETH or something which doesn't have a direct pair with your coin, you, again, have to pay double the fees.

The fees aren't huge, but considering you only bought the coins for staking, and most of the high APYs are for 15-day staking... you aren't making all that much money in the first place. Often times, ***you're not even making enough to cover the trading fees***. 

**- Even if you believe in the coin and already own it, the APY still isn't as good as it seems**

The staking periods are 15 days or 30 days or 60 days or 90 days. But in actuality, they hold your coins for another 2 days before the release it back to you. That's 2 days you're not getting any rewards on; if you're doing the 15-day staking, that's 2/17, or 11.7% of the time you're not staking. It's a bit better if you go for the longer options, but even then, you'd have to pay attention and re-stake them asap. 

**- Most of the popular coins are often ""sold out""**

Coins like ALGO, ONE are almost always sold out, so you wont' even be able to re-stake your coins for days or even weeks; that's even more downtime that lowers your total APY.

And often you'll only be able to do the 30-day staking, which gives the lowest rewards, sometimes even lower than if you just staked the coin yourself. 

--------------------
so tl;dr: with all things considered, there are a lot of ""hidden fees"" baked into binance's staking system that inflates its APY, but you won't be able to get anywhere near the advertised amount. 

It's probably better to just stake in your own wallet for a peace of mind and only on coins you actually believe in."

* the native digital asset is used to protect the network (duality principle: currency and security)
* everyone having ADA or ETH can delegate to a stake pool
* if a stake pool owns 1% of the total stake it will (on average) get 1% of the rewards and distribute it to the people delegating to that pool

CryptoCurrency,"Market Experiment/Challenge: $2K Future Buy I agree with most on this forum that there are far too many BS/meaningless Moon related posts.  Here are my thoughts:

\- We're super, super early in the Community Points game (as evidenced by the 7 figure market cap), where the aftermarket price on derivative tokens (xMoons, xBricks, etc), including any ATHs, is arbitrary.

\- If you're a speculator, like me, this is a 100x or bust bet, with the latter scenario the more likely outcome.  I'm completely aware that this could all disappear with the click of someone's mouse.

\- People on this forum will endlessly debate utility; but taking a step back, Reddit has created a compensation system for micro-form content (comments/engagement).  YouTube has pioneered rewarding long form content creators.  FB and Tiktok are trying to build a system for creators of short form content.  The community points program is probably 3 years ahead of the game.  There's a still a ton to figure out; but at the end of the day what's a rewards/compensation program without tangible value?  

\- The obsession on this forum about short-term price is a freaking joke, as the market is so thinly traded.  Look on Coingecko, the 24hr volume has been under $2K for the past few days!  

For shits and giggles, market experimentation, to spread FOMO and/or FUD, I'm going to commit to match the current 24hr volume in a single buy ($2K USD) on Saturday (7/24) on Honeyswap, regardless of where the price is at.

She has many young followers, and took pay in exchange for pushing a scam coin onto her massive young fan base.  
  
Does this have the potential stop her from becoming a lawyer, or will it be brushed over like it didn’t actually happen?"
CryptoCurrency,"How to earn around 15% return on stablecoin via Anchor Protocol, with full insurance (Both smart contract risk + Stablecoin peg protection). Best risk adjusted return in DeFi Anchor protocol is based on the Terra ecosystem and offers around 20% APY on UST deposits. UST is the native stablecoin of the Terra ecosystem. However, Anchor by itself does not provide any insurance or guarantee of the interest rate, so it is susceptible to 2 types of risks: 

1. Smart contract risk and 
2. Stablecoin Peg loss risk. 

All DeFi platform and their tokens have exposure to various types of risks risks. DeFi protocols have inherent **smart contract risks**, which come into play when there is a bug that can be exploited or if there are any oracle failures or breaches in the protocol. Hacks, funds drained via flash loans are all examples of these risks playing out and people end up losing their money deposited in these protocols. 

**Stablecoin peg risk** occurs when the peg drops below $1 and does not recover. This can also be caused by smart contract failure of the stablecoin's protocol, or by loss of collateral value etc. For instance, the DAI stablecoin's peg could crash if the MKR protocol gets exploited. Recently, Iron stablecoin had lost its peg irreversibly. In Binance Smart Chain, several stablecoins have lost their pegs. Hence, for users of stablecoins in Defi, it makes sense to obtain a peg protection as well if you are considering holding non-trivial amounts in stablecoin.  

The 20% APY that Anchor provides can be considered as a risky return, no matter your trust in Anchor/Terra and its developers. To mitigate these risks, we will look at 2 insurance products that offer smart contract risk protection and also stablecoin peg risk protection. 

**Nexus Mutual Anchor Protocol cover:**

This cover provided by Nexus Mutual offers protection for contract bugs, economic attacks, including oracle failures and governance attacks. In all, this should sufficiently cover for majority of risks associated with the smart contract and defi operations.

[Nexus Mutual Anchor Cover](https://preview.redd.it/cugiitmkj0c71.jpg?width=3096&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=19a909cdcf82e20b9c1d34f125498f5c21024c50)

Nexus Mutual is a prominent player in the defi insurance segment, and has a track record for paying out claims. If the Anchor protocol/smart contract/oracles gets attacked, you can file a claim and get back any funds that may have been lost due to the attack. This insurance is provided at a premium of around 2.6%. I.e for a 1000 USD cover, the premium is around $26 per year!

**Unslashed UST Peg Protection**

The second insurance we will be getting is the UST peg protection by Unslashed finance. As I mentioned earlier, UST is a decentralised algorithmic stablecoin and thus has a peg risk. To mitigate this risk, it makes sense to get a peg protection. Now, it is hard to find stablecoin peg cover for most stablecoins, however UST has been around for a while and is the largest algorithmic stablecoin, and the 5th largest stablecoin in crypto today with a market cap of $2bn and backed by big partners like Arrington Capital, so there is a UST peg cover provided by Unslashed Finance. 

&amp;#x200B;

[UST Peg Cover by Unslashed Finance](https://preview.redd.it/jq17c7c4l0c71.jpg?width=2178&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2a173b1d2f98b53207e3a6c0c19fdb27fe11e823)

The premium for this cover is around 1.41% a year. So for a cover for $1000, it would cost you $14.1 paid in ETH. 

As always, it is advisable to read the policy cover documents. Both Nexus Mutual and Unslashed Finance have detailed policy documents that go into depth and explain the protection offered, and the exclusions. This is similar to obtaining car or life insurance, you need to acquaint yourself with the insurance policy documents and terms.  

So summing up both the insurance policies, to cover a capital of $1000, we will be paying $26 per year for Nexus Mutual's Anchor cover and $14.1 for Unslashed Finance's UST Peg cover. The Total cover = $40.1 per year. The return from Anchor is around 20% (currently 19.5%), so for $1000, you will be getting around $195 a year, minus the cover, your risk adjusted return = $155. 

With this, you have covered both the significant sources of risks in using any DeFi lending protocol, and still continue to earn a decent 15% return on your stablecoin. 

Considering the low yields on other protocols, and the fact that the yield on Anchor can be insured for both common types of risk, this makes a great play for those looking to earn extra on their stablecoin holdings, but also looking for a non-risky approach! This is a great example to show how far the DeFi industry has come in the last year or so, now you can earn interest and also insure it within DeFi itself!"
CryptoCurrency,"I am 100% convinced of $100k BTC this year I have Glassnode subscription. I have been following the on chain metrics since the dip in May. I am comparing both on chain and the charts of the current sideways market to previous long bear markets and consolidation markets aka crab market.

At first in May, there was a lot of negative metrics like miners capitulation, whale and retail capitulation.

But since the middle of June, miners are accumulating, whales are accumulating, retail is mostly selling but also the number of wallets keeps trending up. In long bear markets, this will not happen.

The current situation looks exactly the same as the middle part of 2013 and 2017. Some boring months and then suddenly the mother of all bull runs out of nowhere.

First it was Elon FUD. Then in the last 3 to 4 weeks, Bitcoin has overcome being banned by the world's most populated country. It only made a slight impact on price. Difficulty adjusted and now miners are relocating and coming back online with renewables.

Remember China also banned Bitcoin in the middle of 2017. These attacks never work on Bitcoin. It always makes Bitcoin stronger, so expect a raging bull run to start soon.

Bitcoin history shows that dip buyers have always won. Dip sellers just end up buying at higher price. So take your opportunity or you will regret later.

In 2013, BTC started in 3 figures and reached 4 figures.

In 2017, BTC started in 4 figures and reached 5 figures.

In 2021, BTC started in 5 figures and will reach 6 figures.

CryptoCurrency,"Harmony ONE personal experiment I bought ONE from Binance.us, I used an ACH deposit and ONE/USD pair. Four separate market orders were placed in the amount of $10 each. 108 @ 0.0942 (06-06-2021), 137.1 @ 0.0729 (06-19-2021), 159.2 @ 0.0628 (07-02-2021), 147.7 @ 0.0677 (07-04-2021). *As of 07-18-2021 I'm down 12%*.  
  
The reason why I'm interested in ONE is because of the network operation fees. For my experiment I wanted to deploy a contract for my project. I was extremely satisfied with the overall cost to complete the actions required.  
  
You can view my history and compare the details: https://explorer.harmony.one/address/0xddd6130e1f2089d4674797a649424ee5eb061af7  
  
I used Metamask to pull the coin off of Binance. I followed these instructions https://docs.harmony.one/home/network/wallets/browser-extensions-wallets/metamask-wallet to get my wallet ready. Using https://explorer.harmony.one/ I was able to convert my ETH style address into ONE style and complete my withdrawal from the CEX. Binance.us has a 60 ONE limit and charges a .001 ONE fee. My test withdrawal was successful and I followed up with the remainder. The test amount transaction cost .00105 ONE, and .00000005 ONE in gas. The remainder cost the same. In all it was .0021+.0000001. Very quick and affordable so far.  
  
A community member informed me about https://TokenJenny.one where I could create a token contract. I thought this is where my supply would be eaten up, I was proven wrong. The first part of the transaction cost .198438682 ONE, and .000000026 ONE in gas. The second part cost .007839612 ONE, and .000000027 ONE in gas. After adding the contract address as a custom token (ETH style) I was able to see my project in Metamask. 
  
Finally I wanted to add liquidity the the token. I decided to take my business to https://ViperSwap.one to pair my token with ONE. I chose ViperSwap because they have a fairly large amount of liquidity across their platform. To approve my token it cost .000099304 ONE, and .000000002 ONE in gas. The second approval cost .000057064 ONE, and .000000002 ONE in gas. To add the supply it cost .00083763 ONE, and .000000002 ONE in gas. Lastly I added the VENOM-LP to my wallet. 
  
That was it. Feel free to ask any questions and I'll try to answer them.
  

**TLDR; I deployed and funded a token on Harmony ONE's blockchain for .209372451 ONE ($0.013702798800597 at time of writing). Harmony ONE was trading for $0.065447.** https://Coingecko.com/en/coins/Harmony"

Let's say hypothetically I have a 100$/week. There's no way I would be able to buy 10$ per coin per week. So how do I manage it? What is the minimum single order I can do that won't kill me in exchange fees?

CryptoCurrency,"Can any network be sustained on fees only ? Today, all crytpocurrency networks are maintained through inflation.  Even the deflationary / fixed supply currencies are maintained by the timed release of the supply (despite the fact that there is a hard cap on eventual total supply, the bitcoin supply continues to inflate with each block).

At the current blocksize BTC can handle about 27.5k transactions per block, and nearly all of the block reward is the timed release block reward.  Only a small percentage of the total reward is furnished through fees.

This question applies broadly to all cryptocurrencies with a hard cap, eventually, the computers maintaining the network will have to be paid through only fees, and it remains to be seen if this model is sustainable. 

Can cryptocurrency networks remain sustainable once the inflation rate drops to 0? Or is inflation the optimal solution to incentivize those providing compute power to network security?

The inflationary model removes some value from all holders,  those that transact or don't both contribute to the network security.. the fee only model only impacts those who do spend... 

Dunno what the answer to this is... curious if anyone has any good ideas!"

I hope it keeps going up, kind of, but it’s also nice that it’s down because it feels easier to accumulate some crypto. Also, I felt loaded when the market was up and I feel broke now.

Sometimes it makes me feel happy when someone tells me in a post that the bear market is coming and has all kind of statistical analysis to back it up. That lasts foe a little while. 

Sometimes I feel anxiety when I read a post where someone is sure the bear market is hear and tells me to ‘prepare’ for it. Then I feel scared. 

But then I think about my brother, who always beat my ass when I was a kid, and how certain and belligerent he is even though he talks out of his ass like 95% of the time. I’ve learned by now just to not pay attention to him at all because I know that he doesn’t know what the fuck he is talking about, but it just makes him feel smart to pretend like it does. 

And that makes me happy again, until the prices drop more, and then I just keep hodling and get worried again, and it’s pretty much a big cycle. 

Sometimes when I’m really anxious I talk to my dad (he’s sold on Btc and eth) and I worry about the price and when it’s going to go up, and he says “what are you going to do, sell it like a little paper hand bitch? It’s gonna go up again someday.” And then I feel embarrassed, because I guess I know it’s going to go up someday too, but sometimes it’s easy to forget and want to sell it all for dollars.

CryptoCurrency,"If the database of the company providing an antivirus were to be hacked could your seedphrase be stolen? Antivirus software normally checks the activity of your device and I since you normally get your seedphrase when setting up your wallet on a device would they be able to see that seedphrase even if you don't store it in a file? If they were to be hacked, would it just be gameover for your wallet. This has always concerned me because unlike bank accounts, once crypto is stolen it might be impossible to get back. I am not a tech expert so I wanted to know if someone with the knowledge could grace my tiny brain with what they know."
CryptoCurrency,"How “influencers” have scammed their followers out of millions. Let's look at some of the cases of influencers shilling shitcoins. I would link more tweets but they've all been deleted. Still, let's get into this:

* **Banksocial** \- Promoted by **Faze Banks** on May 27 after which it peaked at high of around $0.000015 and has since fallen to  $0.000000647. Another member, Faze Kay, was also involved (just as he will be in another scam).
* **MILF Token** \- Promoted by Twitch streamer Adinross (4.4m followers). [Clip Here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_V4qr51Mhw&amp;t=437s) Three weeks later he then went on to saying he only did it [for the money](https://clips.twitch.tv/TriangularAssiduousDumplingsDancingBaby-wDwTkDBIEZ-KJR3V) and ""hoped"" none of his fans bought into it.  If one of Ross' fans invested $100 in MILF Token during his stream, they would have approximately $5.80 today. 
* **Titscoin** \-  On April 30, Tana Mongeau posted a video to her Instagram Stories telling people how her stake in this coin bought her a Rollsroyce and that they should get theirs now. If you invested $100 on the day Mongeau claimed her Titscoin investment resulted in the purchase of a Rolls Royce, you would have approximately $0.0000000000000000001664 today. Faze Kay also promoted this coin.
* **Save The Kids Token** \- This has made headlines recently and guess who was involved? You're right Faze Kay. He along with other members of the **Faze clan** and people like **RiceGum** promoted the launch of this token acting as ""ambassadors"". Save the Kids hit as high as $0.04 on launch day. Just hours after that high, it tanked. If you invested $100 in Save the Kids on launch day, it would be worth around $3.39 today. 

Other Examples:

* Mark Cuban [promoting](https://blogmaverick.com/2021/06/13/the-brilliance-of-yield-farming-liquidity-providing-and-valuing-crypto-projects/) TITAN. It fell from an ATH of $65 to now somewhere near $0.0000008907
* Jake Paul Among others promoting scam coins. [Link.](https://centennialbeauty.com/influencers-promoting-cryptocurrency/)
* [Another list of examples](https://mashable.com/article/influencers-altcoin-scams)

CryptoCurrency,"Why aren't stablecoins used for purchasing goods more often? This has probably been asked before, but if the main reasons why Bitcoin and other cryptos can't be used for everyday purchases due to its volatility, why not use stablecoins as a method of decentralized money transfer?

CryptoCurrency,"Bought cryptos last summer, sold all in May Hey guys! Hope you are not fully bored of these stories, but just wanted to share.

I am 27-year old student, been a crypto believer from somewhere around 2017 when I started my small mining phase. That lasted for 2 years, and I saved majority of bitcoin that I got from mining.

I bought an apartment at the age of 19 with my girlfriend, and after 6 years of living there, we sold it. I invested around 10-15% of my net worth into cryptos after that in the summer of 2020. (Bitcoin &amp; ETH)

Gotta say it has been a rollercoaster ride with this market during the last year. Recently I have noticed the trend of me checking in on my investments multiple times during a day. It has taken a toll on me both mentally and physically. If we had green candle days, I feel like I am on top of the world. If we got red candles, I got scared and thought I should consider selling because I do not want to be left holding the bag, getting too greedy.

I had a solid plan of unloading off 0,5% of my investments everyday, which had appreciated in value around 7x, and I did that for 20 days. Well, the fear of bagholding got me to sell everything in May.

Essentially selling everything doubled my net worth. After that I was able to buy two apartments with my girlfriend to rent out for.  Basically crypto just secured me a rather safe cash-flow for the future.

I do not have any sound advice for you guys who are probably in the same situation that I was in. Just that if we consider the basics of investing (invest only what you can afford to lose) the amount of money in my cryptos got to a point that was so much I wasn't ready to lose.

I don't check the prices of cryptos daily anymore, and I still believe cryptos are the future. Been DCA:ing back in already."
CryptoCurrency,"How to recover from a stolen seed? Hypothetical question. What if come home, and my house have been robbed, and they somehow got my 24 words and my ledger.

CryptoCurrency,"If a coin was risen to a value off over 500,000 for example, or owned mostly by whales/businesses.. would new coins not become the next main currency? I hope that makes sense. But, if the majority can’t afford to own coins in their entirety without bits of them, would we not just move to a new currency or keep using Bitcoin for example? 

Would there be a reason for us to invest or buy Bitcoin if it’s unfeasible for us to own/make profit from?"
CryptoCurrency,"Welcome to the bear market. Yup, that’s where we are right now so here’s your directions.

Black bears are to the left, brown one ones to the right, and Polar bears are up north.

CryptoCurrency,"Huge spikes on first candle of coin. Reasons? Hey all, 

Sometimes if you go back to the first ever candle of a coin on an exchange site it has a huge spike in price before it comes down to the ""actual"" price. I saw one coin that had a price of 5300 USD at the first candle before it fell down to 1 dollars where it stayed for a long time.

So what makes these huge spikes?

Is it a bug? Was it the initial coin price that people bought at ICO, and then everyone sold off? Was it the price the coin was intended to have before it went down to what people were willing to pay for it? Was it just simply HUGE buy pressure in the beginning? I mean, from 5300 to 1 dollar? That can't be right."
CryptoCurrency,"DCA strategy help? I've taken up crypto as a hobby now for a couple of months. I've made a few mistakes, bought a few shit coins and have been steadily accumulating knowledge throughout that time.

As of last week I've decided to start DCAing on BTC &amp; ETH every week and alternating weeks with a few alts. 

Like this;

Week one
25% BTC
25% ETH
25% ALT 1
25% ALT 2

Week two
25% BTC
25% ETH
25% ALT 3
25% ALT 4


I've been buying on binance and decided to transfer to my personal wallet. I started with ETH and the transfer took away a fair % of my ETH (keep in mind these are not large amounts - $18 ETH became $11 ETH). I stopped short of transferring any more so I don't lose any more.

I don't want to keep my crypto on the exchange - am I doing something wrong? Should I be using a different exchange?

And finally, what is your DCA strategy?"
CryptoCurrency,"Conversation With Stock Broker: Crypto Is Nothing More Than Gambling. TLDR: Young stock broker thinks crypto is nothing more than another form of gambling, and no one should be using it as an investment vehicle. 

MY TAKE: Woke up this morning and continued to DCA in. We are all still in this sooooo early. 

Last night I met a stock broker at a small dinner party and asked what he thought of crypto. He is in his early 30’s so I thought it would be interesting to find out what his take on the future of crypto is. 

He proceeded to lecture me about the in’s and out’s of the volatility and how it will just get replaced by something else in the next few years. I kept my mouth shut and just listened as he waxed on about how traditional stocks will always be the best investment you can make, and no one should have more than 5% of their portfolio in crypto. 

My main question was if he saw a future in using crypto to move money around quickly, easily and cheaply. His response: “We can already do that without crypto…”

We did agree that we both hate Robinhood though, lol."

CryptoCurrency,"Proof of Stake or Proof of Work - is Bitcoin sustainable? Bitcoin PoW
So I mined BTC from 2017-2020 with about 50 S9s few T17 and S17 in Eastern Washington USA cheap hydro electricity. I did pretty good during the run up to 65k on my investment. I shut it down after the halvening. I needed to upgrade to S19s which meant another investment cycle and wait for next halvening in 4 years. I was averaging about $2000/mo in electricity and needed regular maintenance of about $400/mo. 

Cardano PoS
I am running three nodes in US, UK and Singapore. Its was not a simple task to setup, but I have unix/linux systems experience and it appears to be running smoothly now. Electricity is about $20/mo in shared rack hosting facilities. Cardano stake pools are a competition based (best marketing “most skin in the game” wins) because the more people who stake with you the higher your chances of being selected to mint a block and be rewarded in ADA. Today there are 2800 pools and over half of them are not being selected because of not having enough stake. I just started my marketing so time will tell.

CryptoCurrency,"Unpopular Truth: Using an exchange is like using a small bank with no FDIC insurance. I mean, don't get me wrong- exchanges definitely have their place, like spot transactions to turn fiat into crypto while satisfying all the KYC stupidity (neither USD nor physical precious metals have KYC, never will).  But when it comes to doing literally anything else- rudimentary customer service, financial advice, taxation advice, literally anything else...  They are abjectly and demonstrably terrible, with absolutely no help or assumption of any liability when things go poorly, in an ecosystem rife with people incentivized to create poor outcomes.  Even my small, hometown credit union with a meager 3 locations gives rudimentary financial advice, and will insure my deposits ($250K per account) if there's a run or robbery.

Yeah, yeah, most exchanges ""check the box"" and state your funds are insured against a hack or robbery, but if you can't actually call them and ask for help, if you have to *tweet them* to get any semblance of communication weeks later, that's not insurance, that's creative marketing.  They can stake a few million bucks' worth of \[our collective\] coin in a cold wallet and call it ""insurance"" so they can re-class the capital taxes on it (ah- now it's an operating cost doncha know), knowing no one can get to it if they need to.  It's the new fractional reserve lending.  Pagan, spud-less, f\*\*\*ers.

And to be clear- this isn't a call for governance, either.  I don't want governance, I don't want someone to control or correct the bad outcomes or limit my freedom in ***any way***; I just despise the illusion of safety and/or investment professionalism the exchanges flaunt when there is none.  Absolutely none.  We're on our own, get out of the exchanges and into your own cold storage wallets.

This is not investment advice, do your own research.  /rant"
CryptoCurrency,"Why binance is making crypto easy Please bear with me through this post i am not advertising binance or marketing just stating my opinions.

So i know many people here hate binance, but seriously binance is making crypto so much easier. We know crypto is hard like dex, swap, stake and many other things. We talk about mass adoption of crypto by people but its not possible if its not easy. Last time i saw a post here on r/cryptocurrency how a guy used used polygon (matic) and how hectic it was for him.
Pros for binance
There are many options in binance that make it easy for day to day people.  They even have a option to book hotel on binance (i never personally used it just saying).
The best feature i love as a common guy is [Binance pay](https://www.binance.com/en/blog/421499824684901777/Binance-Pay-Borderless-Crypto-Payments)  .So i just send crypto to my brother with no deduction (the best part)  and he converted it to fiat cause he needed the fiat. The only hold up was 12 hours waiting time i know they can work on that.
TLDR : Just saying that if we want mass adoption of crypto it should be easy to use so that normal people can use it and binance does it efficiently."

Total Trades this Week - 18



**Monday July 12th**



Ive spent the last 24 hours riding a series of parachutes on the way down trying to nickel and dime where I can. Sold at 2170, bought at 2140, stop loss trigger sold at 2000, bought at 1975, stop loss triggered at 1960, bought at 1920.  Eyes on the charts all day trying to take advantage of this dip.  Trying to get an idea of where the bottom might be but as of now I dont really know either way. 



**Tuesday July 13th**



After spending the last day or so catching a couple parachutes down, I see a massive sell wall begin to form in the 1950-1960 range. The downward trend alongside the sell wall and recent spike in shorts compels me to sell and set a stop loss at 1965.



As the price dips below 1890 I see a large amount of resistance starting to pile up on Bitcoin around 32200 so I set the stop loss at 1895, it triggers, and I walk away happy with the gains.



**Wednesday July 14th**



Wake up to see Ethereum has bounced back to just above 2000.  My experience tells me you don't see a 150 point surge without some sort of pullback so I sell my Eth at 2010, I later buy it back for 1985.  It feels like it may start to rebound and I dont want to be on the ass end of it.



**Thursday July 15th**



I am super salty today.  All day yesterday I sat on my sale at 2010 waiting for things to drop to around 1960.  I watched it surge up to 2040 and held my sale position, and then it went down to 1980 or so for an hour or two.  I lost my nerve and took the profit at 1982, and within 5 minutes it fell to where I predicted it would fall down to 1960, went to bed just to wake up to it being 1910.



Bah, mother fucker.



Anyway, moving on.



**Friday July 15th**



My fingers got alittle itchy and with weekends more often than not having low volume and slight price drops, I decide to sell at 1925 but I am not in any way confident so I set a super tight stop loss buy back at 1935.  It triggers, I took the loss.  Bad fundamentals.  Bad Dave.



Later that night I swapped my Eth into Bitcoin for a second.  Bitcoin was at 31400.



**Saturday July 16**



Sold the Bitcoin at 31950 then bought Eth at 1895.  Eth starts to move hot, i watched it shoot up and around 1945 I set a stop loss at 1935 but it continues to shoot right up.  I sell eventually yat 1970, however, I get alittle nervous at it rises to 1990.  Fundamentals.  It should come down.  Fundamentals.  Stop looking at it.  I set up some price alerts to notify me if it drops below 1940 or 1950, or if it goes above 2000.  



Shut the laptop, out for the day,



**Sunday July 17th**



Wake up to price alert hitting.  Bought back the Eth at 1910.



Did pretty well this week.





That's all for this week.

We've yet to see mass adoption. If we actually had then we'd have rule 34 artists making buck with Bitcoin rule 34 arts. 

So yeah, we're still early!"
CryptoCurrency,"Free Dogecoin (seriously) Hey y'all, the instagram accout @ givemedoge is giving out more free Doge once they hit 100 followers. They did a giveaway like a week ago or so and I got some doge so it's legit. Sure I was a little skeptical at first but I think it's all legit lol. Just wanted to plug the account for anyone else that wants a small amount of free crypto!"
CryptoCurrency,"Just fyi, the new domain names on unstoppable domains are now claimable In case you have brought any of the 8 new extension domain names then they have become claimable on the Ethereum blockchain.

Obviously you will incur ETH fees for claiming the same.

Do note that while you can claim them now and move them as a NFT to your wallet, Manage option still hasn't been yet activated."
CryptoCurrency,"How the U.S. became the world's new bitcoin mining hub https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2021/07/17/bitcoin-miners-moving-to-us-carbon-footprint.html

-The U.S. is the second-biggest mining destination on the planet, accounting for nearly 17% of all the world's bitcoin miners.

-Prior to Beijing's sudden crackdown, China's mining dominance had already begun to slip.

-Marathon Digital's Fred Thiel expects most new miners relocating to North America to be powered by renewables or gas that is offset by renewable energy credits."
CryptoCurrency,"What are some methods of selling/exchanging crypto to send to bank account UNDER 18? I have multiple cryptocurrency wallets such as the mainstream ones like MetaMask, and a few others, but none of them allow you to directly sell your assets to your bank account, like coinbase, robinhood etc. I am not able create a wallet on these exchanges because I am under the age of 18. I'm not going to disclose exactly what age I am nor how I obtained a significant amount of crypto assets. The only methods I have found that work are buying a visa or amex gift card from a website like coinsbee.com and then sending the balance to myself through paypal. But those websites frequently go out of stock and are not very consistent. I would very much appreciate some tips or methods, thank you."
CryptoCurrency,"Mining my way up! Newb in the Crypto field. I basically needed capital to start investing, and had access to free electricity, so started Mining. Wish I could mine ETH, but have to make do with ETC cuz of the stupid DAG file size.

Also, is it profitable to convert ETC to ETH on Binance?

CryptoCurrency,Deflationary tokens (such as Safemoon) If you've been in the crypto space lately there has been a huge push for Defi deflationary tokens where the supply goes down overtime instead of up. The biggest one out there currently is SAFEMOON. What is everyone's opinion on these new up and coming coins? I want to hear the great the good the bad and the ugly.

CryptoCurrency,"“Bull Markets Can Make You Money, Bear Markets Will Make You Rich.” I’ve started seeing posts on here acknowledging that we actually might be in a bear market. I want to tell you that this isn’t necessarily a bad thing. If you have conviction and believe in the fundamentals for why crypto is valuable in the first place, you know it will go back up.

So if you liked something when it was expensive, shouldn't you like it even more when it's cheap? If you bought BTC at 60k or ETH at 4k, but you're not buying more now, you are investing purely based on emotions. The ones who truly make life changing gains are the ones with true conviction, who keep buying when there's blood on the streets. I know it's a meme but you gotta truly be ""in it for the tech"". You should take this time and truly research what this space is about and the revolutionary technology you're investing in.

If this is your first time investing and you're scared watching all your money go down the drain- I completely understand. I'd be scared too. But that loss is only realized when you sell. Remember this really important fact, everyone who bought the very top of the last cycle are still in the green today. Don’t make the mistake of selling at the wrong time and miss out on the massive inevitable recovery like many will. Investing is all about having a longer time preference. DCA is always the best strategy starting out."
CryptoCurrency,"What made you get into crypto? Let me get started.

It was after the Snowden leaks and how the government controls everything and knows everything we do.

Crypto allowed me to fight back and be my own bank and not adhere to superior powers.

What is your reason to get into crypto?"
CryptoCurrency,"How to introduce crypto to the people who have no interest? I have been thinking about this for sometime and have a couple ideas but also want to hear what you all think. 
I recently got in to crypto like many others, with the thought of making bags of money in a short period of time.  I wanted, and still want to, pay for my kids college educations someday.  I still believe I will be able to do so, but have also learned a significant amount about the tech behind my two favorite crypto’s (ETH and ADA). 
My mind set has now changed to holding my bags for the long term.  That is made a little easier with my kids only being 5 and 7.  That means in have at least 10-12 years before they are off to college.  
I want to share my new found passion for crypto but have had a hard time getting people excited about it.  I recently stumbled across the game Coin Hunt world.  It is very similar to Pokémon go,  earning rewards by traveling to points of interest in your local area.  This game gives free ETH and BTC as rewards for unlocking vaults in your area.  I love it and of course am all in.  I think this would be an easy way to get people involved to DCAing into crypto without have to actually invest.  It is minor amounts of free crypto but the only thing they can lose is time playing the game.  
How do you all get other involved in crypto?"
CryptoCurrency,"Mining crypto I'm curious as to how mining and the price of a cryptocoin are related, is it dependant on the network for its value or is it just more for support. I'm also curious on what everyone else is mining, I'm personally mining Ravencoin on my gpu and monero on my cpu (gets converted to BTC through nicehash)

Anybody know of anyways to stake Raven?"
CryptoCurrency,"Buying Crypto with Reward Points or Gift Cards? Hey guys, 

So the post a few days ago about the Coinbase Visa debit card inspired me to sign up for one, but that also got me thinking about how I can use the reward points from my current card on crypto. 

I have one of those 3% reward cards so it is a decent return over time, but currently I can only use it on amazon, or have them send me one of many different gift cards. There is a cash option but I think you can only use it to pay off your card balance. I did some googling but haven't found anything informative about doing something like this. 

Any opinions would be appreciated."
