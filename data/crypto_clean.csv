CryptoCurrency,"Hello everyone, yesterday I was thinking about the future and seeing that I will not have an inheritance to whom give my cryptocurrencies, I though about  create a game, book with clues or something like that all over the world.

This game will consist of discovering different clues to find which is the seed phrase of the wallet that I will publicly deliver to some type of entity or museum for safekeeping.

CryptoCurrency,"So I don‚Äôt understand why countries can ban crypto or the even worse part is where people follow the ban rules. You can still have a non-KYC wallet and store your crypto safely in it and not give a damn about govt‚Äôs ban. The basic rule of crypto is not be controlled by anyone, if a govt is banning and we‚Äôre following it, we‚Äôre almost helping the govt to control crypto. We shouldn‚Äôt give a damn about govt‚Äôs crypto ban decision until the government understands it‚Äôs not something that they can control. That is what true decentralisation means.

CryptoCurrency,"Listen, nothing you read on the internet is financial advice. That's the first thing. Until you get educated and invest based on your own research, you cannot be successful long-term.

But what internet gives you is information for your research! You need to learn how to filter the signal from the noise.

How are whales, institutions and pro traders successful? Because their strategy is based on information/metrics, including social media sentiment. Filtering out signal from noise is fundamental to having a sustainable long-term strategy.

Noise - Stupid meme posts without any research. Everyone saying we don't know shit about fuck to farm votes.

Signal - Whales buying bigger than ever since January, Lightning network going parabolic, countries competing to attract miners from China, price action matching the middle part of 2013 and 2017 bull cycles, Fibonacci golden ratio, last big batch of GBTC unlock ended yesterday, retail selling. 

Retail just follows some famous person's opinion who is using influence to manipulate them and usually the words and actions don't match at all, so retail will forever get fucked. I guess they say ignorance is bliss because it's an easy way to get fucked!

If you want to go to the other side. Learn to study the metrics whales do and learn what matters and what doesn't matter by backtesting your models.

As you know, I was already convinced. But Fibonacci golden ratio convinced me even more. I am all in. Thank you paper hands for the discount sale. I'll see you at six figures.

Let‚Äôs say for example that you would like to have 1 Full BTC, but never had enough fiat. You put some money every month and was able to get 0.15 BTC at an average price or $9000 USD, for an interesting investment of $1350 USD.

Then you hodl, 1.5 year later, you see it going up to ATH of $67K USD. Congrats. Then, you see it going sideway for about 1 month and realize the hype is gone and decide to sell at $50k, you now have $7500. You own %15 to the IRS on your profit, but meanwhile you move you $7500 to blockfi in USDC at 7.5% APY. After 1 year you now have (Profit on  $8062.5) - %15 IRS  

You wallet on Blockfi now has $7056.5 in USDC. The market crash and BTC is back at $17k, you decide to rebuy and now have about 0.46 BTC.

I feel like this would have been helpful to hear when I was first starting out, even if it is not perfect. I am not here to shill my coins so I won't go into details there. I understand others may have different positions - I would love to hear what you are all doing to maximize this current stage in the market. This is not financial advice...

Target Coins

* BTC 30%
* ETH 30%
* ADA 5%
* ALGO 5%
* ATOM 5%
* XTZ 5%
* DOT 5%
* VET 5%
* LTC 5%
* DASH 5%
* BAT
* XLM

Intro strategy

I have had a small bag all coins listed and a few more before the recent ATH correction. The first thing I did was to sell out of projects that I was not truly behind, and everything I did not truly understand/see a use case for. When I saw prices that were decent (one of the first dips to 29/30k) I took the extra cash and then some to re-invest in the above list. This gives me a lower/good cost average for my coins moving forward.

Exchange info

I use Binance US only for VET. I have only used them for about a year, so I don't have as much trust with this exchange, but have had no bad experiences. Moderate fees, funds hold 10 days before withdraw from ACH deposit, allows access to shitcoins (LOL). I use Uphold for the sole purpose of BAT. It is the wallet accepted by the Brave Brower, which rewards free BAT monthly for receiving ads. I would change this immediately if I could, not a fan. I have used Coinbase and Coinbase Pro since 2017, and this is where I buy most crypto. I feel its important to explain why I use CB, because it has been very helpful in the process.

* Trust (Old exchange, SEC regulated stock)
* Earn (I have earned over $50 worth of crypto for free)
* Instant transfer deposits (from ACH, to Coinbase - not CB Pro. Allows immediate transfer of funds)
* Low/no cost conversions (Coinbase allows converting from crypto to crypto. I have never noticed a loss in dollar value after a conversion. Converting to stable coins does not apply, as there is a trading fee)
* CB Card (I deposit spending money in USDC, spend and earn 4% back in XLM)
* In house staking (Initially I used this more, but I chose to move all but ETH to wallets)
* App layout, crypto markets/information (between CB and CB Pro there are many ways to analyze charts, markets, and research coins.)
* Instant transfer between CB/CB Pro
* CB Pro ordering functions (lower market order fees starting at .5%, decreasing as volume increases monthly. Limit orders are even less. Access to limit buys and sells is important)

Investing strategy

I earn income weekly, so I have an amount set aside that I set up a recurring deposit to Coinbase (USDC). There is no fee, and I actually earned $5 for setting it up. 100% of this is transferred to CB Pro, instantly, for free. It is then converted to USD, where 50% is placed in market orders, as split in the coin breakdown above.

The other 50% is placed on limit orders. I take a look at the charts and find the 14-28 day low average for each coin, and this is my starting point for the first order. The second order will be placed at a percentage loss from that starting point, and the third will be placed at a percentage loss from the second order. I chose -15% for BTC and ETH, and -20% for all others listed. Example - BTC starting point/1st limit order $30500. 2nd limit order is -15% so $25925. 3rd limit order is -15% again so 22036. If the limit orders don't trigger, I simply add more to the order the next DCA, strengthening my purchasing power for the correction. If the orders trigger, the process starts again with the next deposit.

BAT and XLM are earned through Brave browser and CB Card, respectively. I do take seperate funds and deposit USDC for the sole purpose of having USDC to spend and earn XLM on my daily purchases and bills. I leave the BAT in Uphold due to fees but transfer the XLM to Celsius to gain interest. As you will see, the next part of the ""investing"" is actually earning crypto by staking/holding.

Wallet info

I am getting tired so I'll speed it up. Although most vets would recommend them, I have yet to purchase a hardware wallet. I feel secure with my amount of crypto with my wallets and exchanges security. 2FA, passphrases, whitelisting, etc. have given me security for years. I'll just list what I use and why.

* Celsius (BTC/DASH/XLM) - not my own ""wallet"" technically but has layers of security. The risk is in the company, whom I try to keep tabs on. you receive 6.2% APY on BTC, 4.6% on DASH and 3.1% on XLM. Free withdraws. DASH and BTC have relatively low transfer fees so not much is lost on the way in. XLM has 0 fees!
* Blockfi (LTC) - See Celsius description but 4.5% on LTC, with low transfer in and 1 free withdraw a month. Admittedly I am less favorable of their operations.
* Coinbase (ETH) - It has high costs to transfer ETH and its tokens, so I choose not to. I lock in the ETH on CB for 5% APY.
* Yoroi &amp; Daedalus (ADA) - Native wallets for ADA. I split my ADA in these two wallets with different staking pools. Easy to operate after researching.
* ALGO Wallet (ALGO) - Native wallet of ALGO. Smooth interface, easy to operate with automatic staking.
* Cosmostation (ATOM) - Native wallet of ATOM. Smooth interface, easy to operate with automatic staking.
* Magma (XTZ) - Native wallet of XTZ. Smooth, easy to operate after researching.
* PolkaWallet (DOT) - Native wallet of XTZ. Smooth, easy to operate after researching.

CryptoCurrency,"Literally no person has ever lost money holding BTC for more than 3.5 years - even if they bought at the absolute tops of the market.  Price has never receded lower than prior cycle's high.

This is why BTC is parroted as the number one coin a new investor should hold. It's still one of the safest bets overall for high growth. 

Unless you're an knowledgeable investor who understands things like market cap, initial coin distributions, inflation rates, actual use cases, programming language used, etc... I'd stay away from anything outside the top two big boys. Most of the market is way too speculative and small caps get manipulated a lot easier.

Gambling at a casino is almost always a losing proposition, but HODLing BTC and maybe ETH is like you being the house instead of the chumps throwing money around.

CryptoCurrency,"Social Networks as Exchanges (Snax)- The future


The enemy of cryptocurrencies is centralization. Therefore, the way to strengthen exchanges is to decentralize them. Instead of relying on a few exchanges, there should be hundreds of thousands of exchanges. If there were hundreds of thousands of people independently buying and selling codes- cryptocurrencies-, strings of numbers and letters, across the globe, there wouldn‚Äôt be a single point of failure. 


I imagine in the very near future, buyers and sellers of cryptos can establish small relationships based on their social media profile, their phone number, or a meet-up. My local division of motor vehicles uses an ingenious identity system for public identity instead of using people‚Äôs names. Their system uses just the last four digits of your 10-digit phone number. 

# Last Four Explained

By using the last four digits in a trade, the only people who would know the full phone number would be the buyer and seller. Each party would be able to see the reviews by the last four digits prior to engaging in the trade. The buyer would contact the seller, or visa-versa, and the trade could be initiated once both parties have confirmed the last four of the phone numbers match with the four posted online. 


In this scenario, both parties are vulnerable. Each has the other‚Äôs full phone number. Therefore, it will be in the interests of both parties to behave responsibly. The phone number scheme is just an example of how reputation can be established across all social media platforms and will make exchanging crypto-currency for fiat much easier and more decentralized. A trade ad in the following manner can appear on any social media platform:
    
    [buying] up to 0.5 bitcoin cashapp, zelle, youtube (***)-***-0123                                                                        
    
    [selling] up to 0.5 bitcoin cashapp (***)-***-5869


The tools to accomplish this are widely available. There are review systems in place to be used to record your interaction with a buyer or seller. You can provide positive reviews and negative reviews of trades. It would be about reputations and grades.Trades can be made across any region as long as there is some form of trust and reputation. Trades can be made over the phone, via emails, in person, or drop locations. 


With prevalent services such as paypal, zelle, and cashapp, cash can easily be sent among trusted parties. The trust comes from reviews and past trades. Being that cryptocurrency addresses and wallets are nothing more than words and numbers, these transactions would be protected by freedom of speech. 

#Be Careful

One word of advice is still to use common sense when trading. It is better to make several small trades instead of one big trade. This applies especially when trading with someone new or untrusted. Regardless of how good the deal may seem, go with small amounts at first. There is nothing worse than sending someone your cryptocurrency and not receiving anything in return. It is like a kick to the gut. It is better to lose a small amount than a large amount of coins.

Don't get me wrong - I would love to see ppl from developing countries get hold of new tech-enabled opportunities but, when something seems too good to be true, it usually is.

The thing about societal disruption is this - it is sustainable as long as it successfully channels resources (like computing power or human labour) into something that society values &amp; rewards financially. Using electricity to secure a payments blockchain is a good example.

Creating new types of online jobs like developers for blockchain projects or even VAs for companies in developed countries is another good example, that works and is sustainable.

Channelling human labour into playing a game as a form of economic activity in itself is NOT sustainable, unless it generates value outside the game. The market rewards this only in the short run (as the bubble grows), with the pop being inevitable, once there is no new $$$ flooding in.

If the model is for everyone to make money by playing, where is this money coming from? In reality, it has to be a zero-sum game.

I'm not saying the game itself is not good but the economic model seems very flawed. I think mindlessly promoting it as a messiah for the developing world is a very dangerous bubble behaviour, as this can and will backfire viscously.

Nano has ZERO transfer fees. Same is basically true for XLM, if there are fees they aren't noticeable.

CryptoCurrency,"I'm not trying to be a doomer or just spread FUD, but I've been doing a lot of research on DeFi recently and don't really see any other way to interpret this.  I know I'm not the first to notice how fucked the current situation seems. As far as I can tell, the DeFi ecosystem has built itself into a giant house of cards, propped up by hopes &amp; dreams at this point.

Getting a picture of the entirety of DeFi is kind of complicated (I definitely don't understand it all), but for the sake of this post, DeFi i'm referring to is the series of applications developed to enable various ""decentralized"" financial functions on the blockchain.  

The 2 most popular functions being Crytpo Lending/Borrowing and Decentralized exchanges (DEXs)

Crypto holders are incentivized to participate in DeFi as a means of ""Yield Farming"". Basically, parking crypto assets into a liquidity pool so it can earn interest and fees, paid out in the form of an app-specific token.  Sometimes the annual interest returns are huge.

Cypto borrowers get a great deal through these apps too. Put up some coins as collateral, and in return you get instant access to liquidity. No credit checks, no applications... all automated. 

There is a lot of opaqueness in the DeFi market and like I said, I don't fully understand it all. What I understand for sure is:

1. DeFi depends on a consistent stream of incoming liquidity
2. DeFi also depends on the volume of transactions on the network (to collect fees)
3. The price stability of tokens on DeFi apps rely on arbitrage traders (a lot of this in the form of bots)
4. People who get into DeFi projects early see much higher returns. As returns drop, they move their liquidity elsewhere.

All fine in a controlled environment. But here's where I see it going all wrong.   
As the crypto market heated up in 2020, money began flooding into DeFi applications.  Since DeFi allows traders to leverage their assets to make bigger transactions...this in turn helped prop up the entire crypto market with a surge of new liquidity.  After all, all of those tokens previously sitting idle in people's wallets were now being put to work. 

The amount of value just locked into DeFi is now astronomical, currently somewhere over $66 Billion (down from a peak of almost $100 billion).  

But as the DeFi world started to heat up, more and more dApps came into the fold promising increasing interest and rewards. Interest rates in these pools are almost always higher when the coin or token supply is low and demand is high....as more people rush to participate, the yield returns typically drop.  

So we saw Yield Farmers getting increasingly sophisticated. To maximize rewards, many lenders would run their tokens between different pools chasing the highest returns. 

Yield farmers also would then re-invest the tokens received from one liquidity pool, into separate liquidity pools on other dApps for THAT token.  Creating complicated daisy chains of returns. 

To stretch things even thinner...many yield farmers would use their yields as collateral to BORROW more assets, then invest those in liquidity pools, to further increase their returns.

The economics behind this are pretty mind-numbing. Its akin to the mortgage backed securities situation in 2008. Basically....tons of collateralized ""junk"" assets are being traded, all based off a pool of inherently risky &amp; volatile crypto assets.  Remember, the market for these tokens only exists on DeFi.

Honestly its hard to wrap my head around. But I do know all of it depends on new liquidity and volume coming into the systems, and the value of the underlying tokens remains stable or growing.

So the big glaring question is....what the heck happens when the liquidity dries up or the value of the tokens drop off a cliff?

We've already seen multiple times how a dApp can have a meltdown.

* In Mar 2020, we saw the MakerDAO liquidity crisis . Basically, ETH price dropped...people rushed to  stablecoin DAI, and the app also triggered automatic liquidations (which malfunctioned). This caused a huge shortage of DAI on the system, and people to lose out big time.  [https://www.coindesk.com/makerdao-adds-usdc-as-defi-collateral-following-black-thursday-chaos](https://www.coindesk.com/makerdao-adds-usdc-as-defi-collateral-following-black-thursday-chaos)
* Later in Sept. 2020 we saw the SushiSwap rug pull. Long story short...a billion dollars flooded into SushiSwap DEX...then the developer pulls out all of his liquidity suddenly. The underlying token value plummeted...but so did the price of Etherium (by 30%+), and subsequently bitcoin. 
* Then last month we saw the IRON/TITAN ""bank run"".... investors tried to redeem their stablecoins and sell the asset, leading to a massive selloff that tanked the token price to $0 [https://www.coindesk.com/iron-finance-says-it-suffered-cryptos-first-large-scale-bank-run-in-token-crash-postmortem](https://www.coindesk.com/iron-finance-says-it-suffered-cryptos-first-large-scale-bank-run-in-token-crash-postmortem)

So we already know potential consequences that can happen.   
 **1) bank runs on DeFi tokens are possible.**   
 **2)  A sharp drop in the value of any of the assets in a liquidity pool can lead to mass liquidations,**  
**3) When the value of DeFi tokens plummet suddenly, it takes the ""mainstream"" crypto market down with it**  
**4) All of this also has the potential to unpeg stablecoins**

As far as I can tell, all it would take is for the underlying crypto asset price of Etherium or Bitcoin to crash low enough to trigger mass liquidations. Suddenly, you're left with a huge flight of liquidity, and tons of ""empty"" token pairs. As traders rush to get their tokens exchanged for ""safer"" assets, the liquidity pools are drained, and gas prices skyrocket. These combined effects could in-turn shut down the entire arbitrage and liquidation markets...all resulting in complete price instability. 

It would cause a catastrophic ripple effect throughout the entire market.  Once all of that leveraged lending goes away, and thousands of coins are unlocked/ sold onto the open market, it will be apocalyptic for crypto prices.  

Whether individual projects are ""good"" and some are ""bad"", doesn't really matter in this case. They've pretty much all been linked together in some way. If the biggest domino falls at the top, the rest come with it. 

Tbh, its kind of horrifying. 

**TL;DR:** The current DeFi ecosystem seems like the 2008 mortgage crisis, Bernie Madoff ponzi scheme, and Amway all rolled into one...and its going to collapse when the price of Bitcoin / Etherium drop too low. Only this time, there's not going to be a bailout. Am I reading into this wrong?","What am I missing? It seems the way DeFi is currently set up it could potentially take down the entire crypto market. The whole ecosystem is over-leveraged, dependent on constant liquidity and rising token values.

CryptoCurrency,"Hey all, I just wanted to share some initial thoughts.

I recently decided to get the Coinbase card. I was on the waitlist for about a month and a half until I saw a post on another subreddit about a guy that got his after 6 days waiting. He suggested to open a support case. I did so over the weekend and I suddenly received my approval email today.

I am kind of excited and I will tell you why.

I usually use an AMEX card for all of my bills and day to day expenses because I want to get points. I pay off my balance on the statement close date to not incur interest charges. However, doing this becomes a snare because I get used to just blindly charging anything and everything to the AMEX card and I usually end up using the points to pay off the card or subsidize a big purchase. 

Enter the Coinbase Visa card. It is actually a prepaid debit card that gives you 4% XLM or 1% BTC cash back. By using the Coinbase Visa card I am forced to stay on top of my purchases and not blindly spend money. In addition I'm getting way more cashback than whatever I was getting on my AMEX.

Another thing is that, if you've been in this space for a while, you're bound to get some nice airdrops and (I know this is controversial) have to pay the tax man. I would set aside whatever capital gains/airdrop income I owe and put it in my Coinbase card right before submitting my debit card payment, further getting cashback from paying the tax man. So If I have to pay $10,000, I would get $400 cashback from that trasanction! 

Plus USDC gives more interest than my bank's savings account. I saw something about 4% APR for USDC coming soon, so I wonder if can get in on that action while doing all this.

The only thing I need to look out for is if someone steals my debit card info from some places I make purchases... you know, like when using your bank card. Still gotta do research on that. I wish there was some kind of purchase approval pop up on the Coinbase app or something for extra security.

Oftentimes we use coins and tokens interchangeably to refer to our cryptos. However, there is a slight difference between the two which many would simply neglect for convenience.

&amp;#x200B;

Let me explain this difference.

&amp;#x200B;

Coins refer to any cryptocurrency that has a standalone and independent blockchain. For example, BTC, ETH, ADA, ATOM, ALGO, XRP, XLM, DOT and KAI are coins because they run on their own blockchain, not just simply built on top another blockchain.

&amp;#x200B;

On the other hand, tokens are derivatives of the primary blockchain. To simply state it, tokens are built on top of another blockchain, specifically smart contract blockchains. For example, LINK, USDT, USDC, CHZ and UNI are tokens that are built on top of Ethereum.

&amp;#x200B;

Let us proceed on more complicated scenarios.

&amp;#x200B;

CryptoCurrency,"I bought and joined the crypto space during the ATH this year. I am very confident with my purchases because  I did my own research.

I put in more cash in despite just recently bought a house and there are plans to renovate. I always tell myself it's just another $100, it ain't a biggie, but it all adds up.

CryptoCurrency,"The vision:  A coin backed by a network of homes that people actually live in. After all, few things could be as tangible or as real as the home you live in. And real estate is one of the most stable asset classes, at the same time also keeping pace with inflation unlike fiat pegged stablecoins. So while this coin may not be stable in terms of its peg to fiat, it is more stable in terms of preserving purchasing power. Eg 1 coin = 1USD now but may be 2USD in the future, vs USDT which will still be 1USD. Just as importantly, it provides an alternative to fiat or gold.

The hope is that pegging it to real estate would mean that it keeps up with inflation and with lower volatility, could make it suitable for daily purchases and transactions. It might also lower the cost of borrowing which could make Defi more competitive with Cefi. Eg, with interest rates around 10% who would take out a home loan in crypto when fiat interest rates are 1-3%? Or just reduce the collateral needed.

A brief overview of how it would work is that the money raised for this coin would go towards a co-investment in people‚Äôs homes. The co-investment will be paid back when the homeowner sells their house or after a predetermined number of years eg 30 years. The money can then be used to co-invest in another home.

If you're wondering where the homes that back this coin would come from, here's where the idealistic part comes in.
The first group is renters, so many people are renting when they hope to own their own homes, instead of paying a landlord why not build up your home equity and wealth instead? The co-investment could fast forward their homeownership dreams by years by coming up with the down payment and other upfront costs.
The second group faces systemic discrimination such as women, racial and sexual minorities or even just singles who don‚Äôt benefit as much from governments‚Äô family planning policies and subsidies. They typically take a long time to save up for a down payment if ever. A co-investment can be very empowering by making up for the shortfalls in the system immediately.
The third group is those who already have a home and may still be paying off their mortgage and want to tap into their home‚Äôs equity. Some may have run into financial difficulties, some want to cash out a portion of their homes. Instead of taking a home equity loan which results in more debt that you have to pay interest on, a co-investment gives a debt-free way to tap into their home equity.

This is a pretty high-level overview of how it works and who it intends to serve, if you have any questions or doubts do comment below!",Would you invest in a coin that promotes homeownership? üè°,1626831663

Coinbase isn't the first to have a problem with it, and they won't be the last. It took 4 months to get them to manually verify me. Everything was fine for 3-4 weeks, then verification was pulled for some reason. 

So, I reuploaded my photos, knowing their system wouldn't work, but gave it a week to do its thing before I reached out to them. When I did, I had to wait almost a week for a response, telling me what I already know. I need to upload photos and be verified. 

I tell them what happened the first time around, and that my ID has issues with automated systems. Where the initial message was typed by a human, the response I got was a scripted ""this is how you upload photos for verification""

I again respond to them that I understand how to verify, that it was previously working, something happened on their end and I lost my verification, and would need manual verification again. No response. 

Today, i get an email that the ticket has been marked as resolved and closed. I check the app, and sure enough, still not verified.

CryptoCurrency,"#Get Your Hands On Some Coins

   You know what a cryptocurrency is, you know how to evaluate a project, and you know where to find projects. The next step is to get your hands on some. This can be done in a few ways, depending on what you are comfortable with. Purchasing from an exchange, mining, trading for coins, asking the community outright, or airdrops.
   
     
   A lot of newer projects actually give you small amounts of their coins free. Usually, they will give you some small, insignificant tasks to complete, or the community may just ask you to provide your wallet address for their project. Or, if you follow them on social networks, you may be rewarded with some coin. Don't be afraid to ask newer projects to try it out. Just avoid begging for coins as it is frowned upon. 
    

   Once you have a public and private key, you are able to receive those coins safely. If someone gives you their private keys as a way to give you access to their coins, all you have to do is ‚Äòsweep‚Äô that private key into your wallet. Sweeping keys can only be done on a digital wallet. The wallet of a project will have the ability to ‚Äòsweep‚Äô or ‚Äòimport keys‚Äô. Once the wallet asks you for the keys to import or sweep, simply provide the private keys you were gifted. 
   
   As of late, I have been looking for projects that are putting coins into regular people‚Äôs hands. A faucet is one way a crypto-project can give out small portions of their coins to new users. Bitcoin had plenty of faucets when it first began. Faucets let users experience the coin. In addition, faucets help spread awareness of the coin. If a coin costs too much to send a small amount due to high transaction fees, it is a red flag.  
         

   I‚Äôll use a Lamborghini analogy. Most people will never own a Lambo. Most people will never drive a Lambo. That is because it is too expensive to buy one for most. But, in the crypto-world, just because a coin costs thousands of dollars doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt own a small fraction of the coin. In crypto-space, you should be able to experience a coin regardless of how much it costs, that is because cryptocurrencies typically have the ability to be broken down to eight decimal places. In US currency, as in most currencies, the smallest the currency can be exchanged in is two decimal places, $0.01. In crypto-currencies, we usually go to eight places, 0.00000001 (Ie one sat).
          

    With that being said, any coin can be broken down and shared. The problem arises when the transaction fees outweigh the amount that needs to be sent. This poses an extreme risk of eliminating the little guy from the coin. Another measure I like to use is can the coin buy a loaf of bread and a Lambo in the same hour. In other words, are the transactions cheap and fast enough to buy a loaf of bread from the market; and is it secure enough to buy a Lambo?

    An example of a faucet would be going to a particular website of a crypto-project, and posting your address to receive a small amount of crypto in exchange. Another way to get small amounts of crypto is with a signature campaign. A signature campaign is when a crypto-project pays you to add a ‚Äòsignature‚Äô to your posts that you make on social media sites. Many small crypto-projects offer you small amounts of their coin if you include a link to their announcement page, or website, in your social media posts. So, every time you post a comment on a social media site, people will see a link to The King‚Äôs Coin announcement page. 


  As always, be aware of scams. Don't give your private keys to earns crypto. Payouts of faucets are also questionable a lot of times. A faucet may be beneficial in some instances. If the project is getting the crypto into peoples hands, it's a good sign. It shows that the platform can handle small amounts which may attract more people, thus becoming more popular.","Here is how I explain to newbies to get their hands on 'free' crypto-currencies.

CryptoCurrency,"Heres is my daily crypto sentiment analysis:

Long &amp; short: [datamish.com](http://datamish.com)  still registering low interest in short positions in crypto at these lower prices, revealing bears are not quite so certain as to what comes next. Not a positive indicator either, but a clear indicator no one knows what is next. The lack of confidence of further backwardation however suggest that a further fall is not guaranteed and beyond the flavoribility probability odds for most shorts to hop on.

Sentiment: https://bisonapp.com/en/cryptoradar/ Shows ETH clearly taking the lead in both discussion and positive sentiment overall in social media applications, significantly leading bitcoin, however bitcoin also maintains a generally positive sentiment. Overall interestingly all cryptos seem to still to continue to have positive sentiment, with activitiy discussing crypto being up significantly from previous days and weeks (which we also notice in the daily activity comment count)This suggests retail investors haven't been scared off by lower prices recently, and crypto still maintains an overall positive sentiment.

What comes next: Large investors seem to be debating what is next for Bitcoin and the crypto market. Some suggesting a downward trend to the next support level which they now believe will lie at 27k (as opposed to previois discussion of 25k) while others suggesting this is a ""false breakdown"" which will correct back to the daily 50 day moving average of 34,500 within the next 10 days. Overall sentiment seems strongly divided, which much like datamish info suggests that the market is unclear of what comes next, but retail sentiment remains high.

What to watch for: Tomorrow is ""The B Word"", where top bitcoin investors, including controversial on-again-off-again bitcoiner Elon Musk will be invited to speak about the future of bitcoin. The discussion begins at 9AM PDT tomorrow July 21. Further info can be found here: https://www.thebword.org/c/the-b-word

I have been seeing a lot of people spouting that 20k hasn't been retested as a reason for BTC to fall. Funnily enough, Bitcoin has technically retested 20k for the primary reason BTC was made in the first place.

Inflation

[https://www.longtermtrends.net/m2-money-supply-vs-inflation/](https://www.longtermtrends.net/m2-money-supply-vs-inflation/)

Since 2017, the total money supply(m2) has risen from roughly 14k to 20k meaning a roughly 30% increase in total money. This means, given the amount of new dollars in circulation with the amount of bitcoin, the drop we experienced to 28k a few weeks ago was actually the money equivalent of 2017 20k. Wow that's a lota inflation eh? Someone should do something about it! Sarcasm aside, retesting previous values is all bs. Stop using the past to try to predict the future.

# Are our tech overlords so kind?

The positioning is clear. Crypto sentiment is in dire straights. China already made their move, and we‚Äôre stuck back on the green energy narrative, if you‚Äôre just joining us this cycle.

Quick recap. Here are the events of thinking us westerners used to get here, as per the public‚Äôs focus:

&amp;#x200B;

1. **Jan 8 Elon Musk puts Bitcoin on TSLA‚Äôs balance sheet, plans to accept payments**

*‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know if it makes sense for TSLA to buy Bitcoin \[‚Ä¶\] but I do think it could be a catalyst for sustainable energy.‚Äù‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäFrom the Ark Invest Podcast Feb, 2019*

The corporate treasury move was foreshadowed by his Twitter interactions with Michael Saylor

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

2**. Bitcoin consumes energy and therefore CO2  (exponentially so during euphoric price action)**

Which he was surely aware of before making these moves

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

3. **TSLA stops accepting Bitcoin as payment may 12**

ESG pressuring TSLA is a highly likely outcome for this cyclical problem in which Musk has no choice but to comply, and it's not worth the publicity hazard if his company were complicit.

&amp;#x200B;

So far as I see it, there are two possibilities. Elon had basically no idea what he was doing, and recklessly gambled with TSLA‚Äôs balance sheet. Or this is somehow a favorable situation. He is bringing attention to the problem before presenting the solution.

&amp;#x200B;

# ""Tesla will resume accepting bitcoin payments for its cars once miners of the cryptocurrency can show they are using roughly 50% clean energy"" - Elon's twitter (reliable source)

&amp;#x200B;

We shouldn‚Äôt put the man on a pedestal, or assume he‚Äôs altruistic. There are plenty of incentives within the largest crypto communities for him to maneuver. Big Tech shall have their way regardless, as they offer valuable influence in the battle of information. In this battlefield social media is already the marketing frontier for such debates, while traditional media is at best only incentivized to cover the controversies. Terms like ‚Äúgreen-washing‚Äù imply cultism, or more importantly, that no debate is worth hosting.

&amp;#x200B;

But for Proof of Work blockchain technologies, it may be the most interesting topic to consider. Ominously, it‚Äôs the cliff hanger Hal Finney‚Ää, ‚Ääearly contributor and first receiver of Bitcoin‚Ää, ‚Ääleft as his last tweet related to the crypto.

[https://i.imgur.com/nyoZTav.png](https://i.imgur.com/nyoZTav.png)

 

To be clear, neither side is currently capable of fully proving their point. Jack, Cathie and I‚Äôm sure Elon will put on a good show. If the mining counsel‚Äôs data is considered reliable and more complete, it‚Äôll unlock a more resilient narrative for Bitcoiners. If their ventures create economic incentives for developing sustainable infrastructures, in it may change the whole ball-game. With only their (quite) incomplete paper so far released, these remain fantastical concepts held by those with the power to actually change the world.

CryptoCurrency,"First of all I want to clarify that I'm not trying to shill any other coins whose aim is to solve scalability problems. I myself own some bitcoin, although it's just a few tens of thousands of sats... not much, but it's also the biggest part of my portfolio.

Second of all I want to clarify that I will consider a best case scenario in an ideal world when it comes to explaining the limits of the LN, the real world is of course not as great as the ideal world and a real adoption of the LN would actually be much worse than that which I'm describing.

When it comes to the LN, first thing to be understood is that it's a smart contract on the blockchain aimed to solve scalability issues by taking some transactions off the main blockchain, if person A and person B are often exchanging small amounts of satoshis it's a waste of resources to put every single small transaction on the blockchain, instead they take keep the transactions to themselves and the moment that will stop exchanging they can just share the final balance of their wallets to the main net after all those exchanges.


But this isn't as perfect as it seems, to make a payment channel you need 1: the smart contract 2: an opening transaction on the blockchain. To start with the smart contract, I want to clarify that I am not aware of whether or not they are simply stored in the Bitcoin blockchain and to start executing them you have to reference them or that if you have to store them everytime you want to use them. But for our ideal world I will assume that it's the first option as it's the one that takes the less information on the blockchain. If that is actually the case, then all we need to do to start a payment channel is start the opening transaction on the blockchain, but that also takes up space on the blockchain. And if we can also consider that everyone just connects to a central node on the LN to make payments to simplify things, we have that around ~2000 people can connect every 10 minutes to the LN, that's ~12000 an hour, 288 000 a day, 105 million a year. Considering no changes to the global population (around 7.88 thousand million people) it would take 75 YEARS to make everyone adapt to the LN. And that of course is assuming 1. All new information on the blockchain is used to create payment channels, no normal transactions, no closing payment channels, no other types of smart contracts being executed, nothing else other than creating payment channels. This is obviously impossible, but it's also impossible to know how much % of a block would go into the creation of payment channels in a world where the adoption of the LN is something that is actually being pushed for. 2. Only a single central node that everyone connects to. I don't think I have to explain why this is dangerous, but a single central node means that a goverment can shut down whichever company actually owns that one central node, it's actually better a situation where every country has a one very strong node, or a handful of them. 3. That the global population doesn't keep increasing. 4. That a company that operates as a central LN node doesn't disappear for whichever reason, if that happens, all the open payment channels that one company held will go off and everyone that used the LN with that one company will have to move to another one, going back quite some time in the adoption.

If we actually go back to the real world, we can easily see that an actual proper adoption of the LN would take thousands of years. Not very scalable if you ask me.","I want to think that I'm just being naive but, I have some serious doubts the Lightning Network can solve Bitcoin's scalability issues.",1626820698

A lot of monkeys lived near a village.

One day a merchant came to the village to buy the monkeys.

He announced that he would buy the monkeys for ¬£100 each.

The villagers thought he was mad.

They thought how can somebody buy stray monkeys for ¬£100 each?

Still, some people caught a few monkeys and gave them to the merchant and he gave them ¬£100 for each monkey.

This news spread like wildfire and more people caught more monkeys to sell to the merchant.

After a few days, the merchant announced that he would buy monkeys for ¬£200 each.

Even the lazy villagers now ran around to catch the remaining monkeys and sold them for ¬£200 each.

Then the merchant announced that he will buy monkeys for ¬£500 each.

The villagers started to lose sleep! They caught six or seven monkeys, which was all that was left, and got ¬£500 for each one.

The villagers were waiting anxiously for the next announcement.

Then the merchant said he was going home for a week and when he returned he would buy monkeys for ¬£1,000 each.

He asked his employee to take care of the monkeys he bought.

The merchant went home and the villagers were very sad as there were no more monkeys left for them to sell at ¬£1,000 each.

Then the employee told them he will secretly sell them monkeys for ¬£700 each.

This news spread like wildfire. Since the merchant will buy monkeys for ¬£1,000 each, there is a ¬£300 profit for each monkey.

The next day the villagers made a queue near the monkey cage.

The employee sold all the monkeys for ¬£700 each. The rich bought monkeys in big lots. The poor borrowed money from money lenders and also bought monkeys.

The villagers took care of the monkeys and waited for the merchant to return.

But nobody came.

They ran to the employee.

But he had already left too.

The villagers then realised that they had bought the useless stray monkeys for ¬£700 each and were unable to sell them.

Which all sounds very similar to Bitcoin. If the price goes up what can you do with Bitcoins other than sell them to someone else who thinks they will go up in price even more? And what do you do with your Bitcoins when they fall in value‚Ä¶?

I don‚Äôt know, but just like the villagers trading monkeys, Bitcoin will bankrupt a lot of people and make a few people filthy rich.

Kinda annoying, but no big deal.

A few months ago, I needed to see my trade history from last year. I contact [Binance.US](https://binance.us/) support, they say they can't help me because [Binance.COM](https://binance.com/) and [binance.US](https://binance.us/) are different entities. So I go to [Binance.com](https://binance.com/) and ask for access to my trade history, and they straight up stop answering me as soon as I asked. Radio silence.

You might want to be cautious when trying to compensate possible previous losses, by trying to buy the dip.

In my opinion, there were like literal writings on the wall of a mania in the cryptocurrency space, which generally brings more attention, more buyers and ultimately more money to the space. Dogecoin for example made massive gains in the span of few months (it was 1p in January and peaked 0,68$). It doesn't have a proper value proposition and I think everyone just wanted a slice of the gains because Elon tweeted Doge. This in my opinion goes to show that we might have been just a tiny bit overheated in the market, if a coin created in 2013 based on a old doge meme, managed to reach 70B market cap.

All I am saying is that the money that you put into cryptos has to be money that you could spend for takeout food or coffee, something that you couldn't give a rats ass about. Then you are prepared to have it both ways: The dip gets deeper, but you wont even flinch about it, or we actually have reached the bottom and you make nice gains on your money.

Please correct my spelling mistakes as this helps improve my english! Hope you enjoy! First of all fuck hedge funds!

I was doing research about hedge funds and what strategies they use to earn returns above the average from the market using aggressive techniques. I found out that one of the strategies they employ is the following:

Imagine two companies within a certain sector (say farmaceutical, for instance) let's call this companies A &amp; B. The hedge fund (in this case ourselves) knows that company A will be outperforming company B within the same market segment. A strategic approach might be buying stocks from company A and shorting company B. When doing this, the approach becomes more market neutral. What's the reason behind this? If the market rises, you will have loses with the shorts, but they will be over-compensated by the gains from the buying of stocks A. If the market drops, the profits of the short from B should outperform the loses from stocks A. So, as long as company A outperforms B you will have returns.

I thought this market neutral risk approach might be used with bitcoin and altcoins. If we are indeed in a bear market bitcoin dominance will continue to rise as we have seen in the previous two months. If that's the case, maybe DCA into bitcoin while shorting the worst performing projects that are altcoins (diversify because of possibilities of a short squeeze of alts, such as the one of GME), this could make the investor have returns in dollars while DCA into Bitcoin - a pretty sweet deal.

Disclaimer: I don't encourage anyone to use this strategy nor day trade, specially with leverage, because they are risky strategies and you will probably lose most of your money.

The rising pressure of seeing your hard earned money can be hard on our emotions. Even more if you haven't a diversified portfolio or are trying to rely on your crypto investment to secure your future.   


I think if you are an investor and not a trader you should be breathing and closing the charts. Buy on the way down and diversify. Enter the stock market (which can also crash) and remember how BTC and ETH are supposed to work long term. If companies and countries are starting to rely on these assets to pay people and to secure their central banks liquidity it will rise again.   


Of course you have to understand why people are selling and that in the long run, assets scarcity will drive the price up anyway. IF Apple has a market cap of 2Trillion, the money of the future has to be able to rise higher !

CryptoCurrency,"By 2024 the EU wants to forbid anonymous wallets! 

https://decrypt.co/76432/eu-wants-ban-anonymous-crypto-wallets-2024

How they gonna do it?

Straight forward and simple, one central database (I know, what irony) that will have a huge whitelist of all legal crypto with all the whitelistet addresses. I posted about it 4 months ago here:

https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mf0dqc/my_outrageous_theorie_for_the_hijack_of_btc/

How will it work?

You gonna have licensed on and off ramps, the only ones that can be used. If you send to or receive crypto from an address that's not whitelistet your wallet gets automatically flagged and frozen in the database. 

What are the consequences?

Shilling. Have you ever seen minory report with Tom Cruise and thought about it? I recommend you watch that movie if you are into crypto and want to get a hint into the future struggle with the state. 
In short, once the government knows everything about you, it can start to run algorithms on you and see which kind of person you are. Just by looking at your purchasing behavior there will be certain consequences for you and you will start to change your behavior. It's similar to the social point system in China but 1000 times more efficient. It will be an easy system to control the herd and save the environment (we have to do it, but in my opinion in other more freewill ways üòâ) 

So maybe after all, the conspiracy nuts aren't so nuts, he? 

And there will be no other money (means of exchange of value) than crypto in a few years time. If you doubt it and are really interested the future of the world you better do some more reading. Cash and digital money in current form that's not on a ledger (will say not traceable to it's first inception moment) will be a thing of the past in few years time. 

Are there positives to this development?

Yes, probably no more corruption and the ability to  switch off polluters / other illegal activities (defined by the state) on a dime.","It's on girls and boys, the EU just stated the progress to a totalitarian superstate is going as planned.

CryptoCurrency,"Lets expose the truth.

Before I begin I encourage everyone not to take my word for granted, but to corroborate everything I said doing your own research. I specially encorage people to look a correlational charts where you can clearly see the truth, and also to people who are good creating charts make one that is easy to understand to everyone.

Has anyone noticed how a few days soon after the IPO of coinbase where listed on the stock market crypto currency crashed from around 50k to 25k to 30k? and soon after that the volatility of cryptocurrencies is much more stable in a bad way. Meaning they playing the bear making it be around 30k and make it go down every now and then so they liquidate people and control the cryptocurrencies. Well if nobody noticed I did.

The truth is that whales like hedgefunds in disguise are manipulating the market so they make billions going up and down. Destroying retail investor to keep people poor while they hoard all the money (with the government as well). 

This should be of not surprise since they alwaya been crooked. However, they are really afraid of decentralization and are playing all the dirties tricks they can to keep you poor and under a leash as they want (brainwashed slave servants, with the idea that what you doing is for the greatest good. And the greatest good is really make them rich at people expenses.) Is time to wake up.

Anyhow, this is simply what they doing. They realised that it only took a few millions to move bitcoin price 1% up or down, and becauase when bitcoin goes up or down all cryptocurrencies tend to follow in a tandem then they have comlplete control of the market. They do this buy using  coin base and the whalea inject billions to make go up and making money and then when they agree they take all down to liquidate all the retail prices. The timing of this huge injection and ejection of money only they know. Moreover, with the upcoming of the robinhood IPO things are going to get worst.

So what can we do? Is decentralization worthless? are cryptocurrencies done? No the soluion is simple but will take lots of effort since we must gather even more people than ever before. We have to do the same thing we did with gamestop and amc, however, we must do it with various alt coins that are not bitcoin. In other words we must make the alt coins break the cycle of following the trend of bitcoin. We must play only the bull not the bear to sone alt coins. Why because we gonna make this whalea lose BILLIONS. 

This is going to be hard because this need to be sporadic  bull attacks but persistent why? Because we have spies on the forums like reddit etc. 

However, we are more by a far extent. The soli media has been label an arm of mass destruction so that you know. They fear us because as we have proved with gamestock, amc, DOGE  coin together we are strong. I also encourage to get into decentralized social media webs that are been build as we spoke. Thia is going to be our ace under the sleeve.

CryptoCurrency,"Dating apps (and dating in general) seem miserable for almost everyone. Women are drowning and overwhelmed while men are parched in the Sahara desert. Not to mention the bots. These apps are profit driven making you feel inadequate until you pay for their service. 

***Why make it on a blockchain?*** Because as soon as you leave to develop a centralized app and get investors eventually the design will be compromised to generate profit. The community of users don't have an equal say in improvements/changes. 

Before I get too far, is anyone aware of a project that is doing this?

Now obviously online dating hasn't been miserable for everyone as I've seen many successful stories from Tinder/Bumble, but it could be so much better.  

* The community would be able to determine how they want the app to move forward and propose improvements. For example, if people wanted more swipes per day someone or a group could propose it, it could be voted on, and approved or shot down by the community. This would need to be approved by a certain percentage of all different demographics to ensure it stays safe/equitable.  (A simple majority could ruin the system)
* Identities and bots would be less of an issue. With an official identity attached will decentivize poor behavior. 
* Different settings for different users. For example, if an individual or community wanted to only have women reach out first like bumble, they can.
* a swiping algorithm that isn't designed to get you to spend money or keep you on the app, but one designed to connect you to the correct people

**Design Ideas**

* An in app currency that allows you to do basic functions like swipe and for higher amounts do. A certain amount would be given for free, but could be purchased in limited monthly quantities. This provides enough money in the system to cover the transactions on the blockchain but inflates the value as to not incentivize accumulating the token. **If someone could come up with a way to make this work without monetary value at all that could be better. Money makes people less likely to mess around, but it is not equitable**
* Have a limited amount of active conversations (maybe 3 min -10 max). This prevents people from hoarding matches or being overwhelmed. When the conversation dies out, moves off the app, or ends terribly one of the users has to end the conversation before talking to a new match.
* When a conversation is ended there would be a feedback mechanism that rewards users that are respectful/genuine (I have not yet thought through this completely yet - hopefully someone smarter than me has an idea). If you ghost/have poor messaging skills/swipe on anyone and everyone your in app currency will become more scarce. 
* Community posts, activities, dialogue etc to help our generations fix the toxic qualities of our current dating culture. This could include guides or videos on developing healthy relationships. 
* Community bans/suspensions. Individuals could review reported cases of racism/sexism/assault and all other forms of harm and oppression. The reviewers would be given in app currency and maybe some marker on their profile to show they care about a positive/healthy community. 
* Dystopian Black mirror-esque ideas include having a public or private score that reflects your performance, allowing users to leave comments for the next person that swipes on them, permanently ban people, or sending feedback 
* Utilize LINK to import different types of data - there's potential here, but I need to give it more thought

The US nuclear industry has endured consistent FUD for decades. It combats optic problems that arose from past events (Fukushima, Three Mile Island, Chernobyl) as well as economies of scale issues that make it hard and expensive for it to compete with its cheaper competitors on $/kWh basis (especially natural gas). Despite the obstacles, its experts continue to innovate and develop some pretty incredible technological feats. I encourage you guys to check out some of the most recent developments in [advanced Small Modular Reactor (SMR)](https://www.energy.gov/ne/articles/nrc-approves-first-us-small-modular-reactor-design) technology.

Obviously Bitcoin has also endured a large amount of FUD yet the network has continues despite. The ESG concerns surrounding PoW mining has been one of the big drags on the market for years. The age old question comes to mind, ""Does Bitcoin deserve the resources it consumes?"" Well China says no. Or at least not when compared to its digital Yuan. And after the recent China crackdown miners are scrambling, trying to seek cheaper and alternative sources of energy. This is the story that I'm trying to keep up with at the moment. Where will they land, and does Bitcoin really incentivize clean energy like Nic Carter and Jack Dorsey have proclaimed?

The answer is going to take awhile to materialize but it might just be starting to take shape right now.

CryptoCurrency,"Until now, I haven't really thought to buy much in exchange-based tokens and coins. I have a small amount of one, which was really only purchased because I didn't understand trading pairs at the time, but I kept it for the potential reward benefits of holding it.

If the market continues to trend downwards, and if coins outside of BTC/ETH suffer a 50% drop from current prices, I'm thinking of getting a decent bag of the larger exchange-based tokens like BNB and CRO. My thinking is that they have a decent chance of rebounding with the market, but might be less risky than choosing individual altcoins (I still have altcoin bags but I'm not considering adding to them at this time). There might also be novel rewards for holding a decent amount, like lower trading fees or benefits on Crypto's VISA card.

However, I'm also aware that every dollar thrown at these tokens is a dollar not thrown towards ETH or BTC, and perhaps it's better to focus on those, but currently my gut is to diversify.

CryptoCurrency," 

Browsing through Reddit, you may find a lot of good material of people who have been investing in crypto for more than five years, they call themselves Veterans. Sure, there's a lot to learn from them, however, I would like to give a different perspective; precisely from someone who bought during Elon Musk's bull run and has been studying and learning from crypto since May. 

First of all, if you read a little bit of the posts here, you may find a couple of advice there is constantly repeated:

1. Do not invest more than you can afford to lose. 
2. It is a long-term investment. 
3. Watching graphs every day will make you sick.

These are things that you must accept to survive here, and when I say survive I mean preserving your mental health during the crashes.

However, I would like to add a couple of other tips that I, as a newbie, had to learn the hard way. Do not underestimate what I am saying if you don't want to make my mistakes.

**First**: you must DCA to make real money. During the bull run, I was so amazed by the multiplying factor of crypto that I invested a good amount of my money all at once. When the price fell, I did not have any Fiat to buy cheaper. This means that the only way I will be able to make money with crypto is when the market hits its ATH again, which may take years. Therefore, you should invest a little every week because, if the price falls, you will be able to pay cheaper and cheaper for the coins. Eventually, if the price rises just a little, you will have fast returns.

**Second**: DO NOT FOMO. This also happened to me when I bought MATIC. After Rubio invested a lot of money in it, the price of MATIC rose a lot, especially compared to other coins. Then, after reading very little on the coin, I bought a couple of hundreds of dollars on it. After two weeks, I had lost more than 50% of my initial investment and prices have been falling very rapidly ever since. The lesson here is: if you see a coin that had, in the last two hours, 473189742% rise you lost the train. There's no point in trying to buy it. Just stick with the projects that you like and DCA. 

**Third**: if you invest more than you can afford to lose, you will lose money. This did not happen to me, but it's easy to imagine. As crypto is a long-term game, the price of your investment may vary a lot until you make real money. Therefore, imagine this: 

You invest $500. 

The price of your investment goes to 200$ during the crash. 

You need money to pay rent and did not save any. 

You will have to sell your 200$ worth of coins to pay rent. 

You lost money. 

**Fourth:** you must be mentally ok with the idea of your portfolio going down 90%. Crypto is a wild game. Prices go up and down every time. However in the long run you are expected to make money, as every person who bought crypto a couple of months ago and simple HODL on it. Therefore, if the crash comes, know it will go back up eventually and make sure you have fiat left to buy the dip. 

**Fifth**: this Reddit community is helpful; you can learn a lot here. Most of the people here want to help you. As long as you ask politely, there will be someone who can guide you through answering your questions. I have asked for instructions countless times, and people have helped me on how to sell my moons, what 'FOMO' and 'DCA' meant, what is the importance of the market cap, and so on. As long as you are aware of shilling and scammers you will benefit a lot here.

Hesitancy to upvote means that new users and shills aren‚Äôt as likely to profit from our goodwill as a community. It does (to some extent) separate quality posts from ‚Äúbegging for upvotes‚Äù posts or sob stories.

CryptoCurrency,"I've been thinking, what processes and markets can blockchain be applied to?  Financial, shipping, logistics, etc.. those are pretty obvious.  But what other areas of life can blockchain add value? 

Anyone got any imaginative ideas?  Below are a few of mine.

1. **College/University Course Credit**: there is already a central regional accrediting authority that colleges and universities have to apply to in order to receive a level of value/validity to their educational offerings.  Why not create a blockchain application around college credit.  If you complete English 101 at Local Community College, why can't it transfer to IVY League U, or State U?  If it meets the requirements, why not?
2. **Genealogy research**: this one may be a bit dystopian, but I can see how blockchain can be applied to human ancestry.  Of course, perhaps the ancestry would have to be tracked through the mother because a woman doesn't necessarily have to question whether the child is hers or not.  Either way, you can create an ancestry blockchain going back who knows how far back.

CryptoCurrency,"To those who can hear me, I say - do not despair. The misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed - the bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress. The hate of men will pass, and dictators die, and the power they took from the people will return to the people. And so long as men die, liberty will never perish‚Ä¶

Soldiers! don‚Äôt give yourselves to brutes - men who despise you - enslave you - who regiment your lives - tell you what to do - what to think and what to feel! Who drill you - diet you - treat you like cattle, use you as cannon fodder. Don‚Äôt give yourselves to these unnatural men - machine men with machine minds and machine hearts! You are not machines! You are not cattle! You are men! You have the love of humanity in your hearts! You don‚Äôt hate! Only the unloved hate - the unloved and the unnatural! Soldiers! Don‚Äôt fight for slavery! Fight for liberty!

In the 17th Chapter of St Luke it is written: ‚Äúthe Kingdom of God is within man‚Äù - not one man nor a group of men, but in all men! In you! You, the people have the power - the power to create machines. The power to create happiness! You, the people, have the power to make this life free and beautiful, to make this life a wonderful adventure.

Then - in the name of democracy - let us use that power - let us all unite. Let us fight for a new world - a decent world that will give men a chance to work - that will give youth a future and old age a security. By the promise of these things, brutes have risen to power. But they lie! They do not fulfil that promise. They never will!

Dictators free themselves but they enslave the people! Now let us fight to fulfil that promise! Let us fight to free the world - to do away with national barriers - to do away with greed, with hate and intolerance.

CryptoCurrency,"Hello! First off, I would just like to say that I am still quite new to crypto so I don't post in here often. I am one who bought in at the ATH of most of my crypto, along with so many others in here. 

I have been reading a lot of posts of new members that are concerned about this price drop these past couple of months. I am not here to give advice but to hopefully help others learn what I wish I knew when I started. Most of the senior crypto holders may find this info irrelevant but I hope it will help others. 

So, you bought in at the all time high did you? Welcome to the club. I know from personal experience how hard it is to watch your portfolio dropping to 50-60% of its value. I'm right there with you. One thing I've always been told is never sell at a loss. It's tempting, I know, but hang in there, bitcoin itself was never meant to drop like this and was created to just go up. The whole market has been tough right now as we reach a critical point of investing. As we see the sea of red, not once could I bring myself to sell. Like a lot of you, crypto has been, and will be, a long term investment. With this being said, the price right now really doesn't matter as I look to the future potential of where these crypto will be in 5-10 years time. We've watched them rise from pennies, into what they are now. 

The one thing that I wish I was told about right from the beginning is about your averages. You can see your average in whatever platform you use to invest with. This is the price you bought in at. The thing about the average is, when you buy more at a price that's below your average, it brings down your average price. I've spent months buying in little by little in order to bring my average down, therefore, increasing the value of my crypto for when the price goes back up. I know most of you know about this already, but I didn't when I started. I just watched the price drop more and more and watched my entire portfolio decrease, not knowing or understanding about how the cost average worked. If you're not familiar with lowering your average, please take the time to Google it and research a bit. I just really wish I knew about this sooner when I had first initially purchased. Also, to add, be cautious with this in certain crypto. Know the signs of a failing coin as opposed to one that will recover from this. 

Thank you for those who took the time to read this. I'm not the most knowledgeable person in here and learning more every day but I really hope this post finds some of the new comers and helps them as it helped me.¬† If anyone has any other tips that they may feel are useful for newcomers to hear, please post in the comments, knowledge, no matter how little, is power.

CryptoCurrency,"My uncle recently came to me and said that he was part of an ICO for a lesser known coin that I have heard nothing about nor seen anything posted on reddit (I don't want to say the name of the coin in case I get in trouble from the coin or something). He said he heard about this coin from some ""crypto expert"" he saw online. 

Apparently he invested a few thousand and now it's worth over $400,000 but the ""countdown"" until the coin is on some exchanges is still counting down for a few weeks. He said he received an email from them saying how he is a early investor in the coin he can request the funds to be moved into his account using BTC. He agreed and requested the to withdraw and they said they would move it but then he received another email saying that he must place around $12,000USD in their wallet (they provided an address) for some kind of authentication department as it is worth over 10 BTC and they have a rule that if it is over 10BTC then they have to use some kind of manual verification. My Uncle didn't like this and obviously thought this was fishy so he asked if he can have his own wallet in a public exchange and they agreed that as long as the $12,000 is in his account on a site called Blockchain.com, they will confirm the transaction and then send the $400,000 to his wallet. 

Why did they agree to this and how can they verify the money if it is in his own online account at blockchain.com? 

I asked why not just sell the coins during the ICO and he said he already asked for a early withdrawal and they approved it and he also thinks the price may go down when the coin is released. I told him to ask them to cancel the withdrawal and sell after the ICO or perhaps he can ask to withdraw less than the 10 BTC limit now so he gets that money and doesn't have to pay this supposed $12,000 USD fee and sell the rest after the ICO.

CryptoCurrency,"I'm considering switching a portion of my crypto portfolio over to crypto ETFs vs personally holding individual coins.   I'm guessing the general sentiment here will be against this.  but, I'd like to hear opinions on the pros and cons on taking this approach to holding crypto in your overall portfolio in this manner.

Off the top of my head, the pros and cons for this would be;

* Pros
   * Invest in a basket of coins with an asset mix managed by a professional manager
   * Securities industry oversight and registered organization (I know that seems questionable lately for some people)
   * Easy to own in retirement accounts
   * Transfer with portfolio to beneficiaries without any need for crypto knowledge
   * No exchange fees
   * Ease of management with the rest of my portfolio
* Cons
   * As always... not your keys, not your crypto
   * high management fees compared to other ETF's or mutual funds
   * fund performance is not perfectly correlated to the assets held in the fund.
   * trading hours limited to market hours

* Annual Fee: 2.5%
* Current Holdings

CryptoCurrency,"Hi, I would like to understand how to use BSC in Binance to send coins to my hardwallet and use Metamask for staking.

I have been reading a lot and understand that you can send it using the BSC network of Binance as a cheaper way and then it wont appear in your Trezor but will be displayed in the Metamask account under the BSC mainnet.

Then I guess I can use all the dapps from BSC for staking.

My questions are as follows:

\- When I send imagine ETH to my hardwallet using BSC BEP-20, then my ETH becomes BETH right? So its an IOU agreement between Binance and myself right?

\- What happens if Binance defaults? Is the obligation gone and I will never be able to convert my BETH back to ETH?

\- If I use the BSC network, Binance will have the underlying so the point of the hardwallet is useless because they will have the underlying and you will have a copy right?

\- If I stop staking and then I want to send my BETH back to Binance for trading, does the BSC automatically convert the BETH into ETH when it arrives to my Binance account? If not will I receive BETH and then I will have to convert it?

\- Why is BETH then not pegged 1:1 to ETH? I mean under an IOU Binance has the obligation to refund you what you converted at the time so it looks like the lower gas fees are just an illusion as then you will have to convert the pegged tokens back to the original one and the discount is uncertain and can be huge right?

\-When staking using a hardwallet and Metamask (Imagine I stake using beef for example) then if something goes wrong with the smart contract or there is a bug, is there still the risk of losing the coins despite holding the private key from the hardwallet? I guess that when you agree on staking you are signing a smart contract and therefore any loss despite holding the underlying coin will impact you when you stop staking right?

Apologies for all the questions, I have been reading a lot but these questions are never addressed.

CryptoCurrency,"First of all, I need you guys to know what a colossal jam Teenage Dream is.

Now, on January 25, 2018 Katy Perry posted [this image](https://www.instagram.com/p/BeXchJzFkhJ/?hl=en) on instagram of her nails painted with the logos of various cryptocurrencies. After having searched this subreddit I found [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/hmwuiv/how_well_would_a_katy_perry_portfolio_have/) that already talked about the image but you can consider this a post bull market peak update.

So, the cryptocurrencies painted on her nails were BTC, ETH, XMR, LTC, and XLM and the prices on the date according to CoinMarketCap were as follows:

* BTC: $11259
* ETH: $1056
* XMR: $317
* LTC: $180
* XLM: $0.60

Good, now let's take a look at 2 scenarios:

**Scenario #1: Katy Perry is a genius and sold all her coins at the top of the bull run.**

* BTC: $63314 (April 14th) +462%
* ETH: $4168 (May 11th) +294%
* XMR: $478 (May 8th) +50%
* LTC: $409 (May 10th) +127%
* XLM: $0.71 (May 16th) +18%

Assuming she bought equal amounts that puts her percentage gain at **+951%**

**Scenario #2: Katy Perry sold today**

* BTC: $29817 +164%
* ETH: $1764 +67%
* XMR: $183 -42%
* LTC: $106 -41%
* XLM: $0.20 -67%

Again making the same assumption as before her net gain would be **+81%,** which is still respectable and better than I am doing at the moment.

CryptoCurrency,"The very phrase ""buy the dip"" is itself, in the same zoo as ""FOMO"" - an emotion-based sentiment. (IMO. At least as often used in context here.)

First off, ""Buy and hold"" isn't a bad plan. Plus it helps stabilize the market. 

But is it really a *strategy*? It certainly can be a big part of one. But if it's just part of a vague ""buy the dips and hodl"" concept, then that's probably not really a strategy per-se. Or at least, you could probably be realizing more gains and less stress, with disciplined execution on a simple, solid DCA plan. (In part, by catching more of the lower lows before running out of money. Which should be resonating about now.)

Not just DCA *in*, but optionally also **Reverse DCA out**, at least as an additional parallel strategy that you can compare effectiveness against. (Eg you can have a dedicated wallet that gets half of your DCA in for indefinite hodling. A second wallet for full DCA in *and* out.)

I would encourage you to just *consider* the possibility that a singular focus on ""hodl!"" *could* - just maybe - be rooted in fear. (But I don't know your motivation personally. Just think about it - while looking in the mirror contemplatively, maybe even accusingly why not.) For example, fear that you might panic-sell. Fear that you won't be able to get back in. Etc.

A good DCA plan is usually a simple one. The three basic parts of a full DCA strategy:

1. How often and how much to DCA fixed $ in.
1. How often and how much to Reverse-DCA‚Äôing fixed shares out.
1. How to know when to do which.

Regular Coinbase, while expensive per-trade, is the only big exchange I know of that you can schedule regular purchases on. Don‚Äôt even look at the charts, just auto-purchase, directly from your bank, a fixed fiat currency amount, on a fixed schedule. The high fees are worth that convenience, hands-off-ness, and peace-of-mind to me (to me personally). But I also love Kraken and more sophisticated orders - and way cheaper! - for my less frequent coin DCA schedules.

But when to switch from in to out? 

First of all, forget what the experts consider ""bear"" or ""bull"" markets. Because for starters, even if they were 100% correct to the day, that's not the timing that matters for DCA. You more-or-less want to straddle between bull and bear.

Or more accurately and to the point: DCA *in* whenever you, personally, think the market is generally undervalued - on the scale of at least several weeks to months. Axiomatically if overheated, then Reverse DCA *out*.

You could literally just base your entire strategy of when to DCA in or out, based on a Simple Moving Average, eg 50 or 100 day SMA. (Which does mean you'd always be behind and will miss some deals and gains, but it's also it's much harder to really screw up and is significantly less stressful.) For such a strategy, DCA-in, in the ""bowl"", DCA-out in the ""dome"". (At the time, the flip is evidenced by the change from increasing to decreasing slope and vice-versa. You don't need to watch the charts every day to see when it happens, the slope of a SMA changes slowly, so you can see it coming in advance - but not necessarily predict, because it can always instead continue curving the same way after flattening out for a bit, rather than reverse. The point is, it's slow.)

Or whatever floats your boat. Use the ‚ÄúBTC Rainbow‚Äù for general market sentiment, even for alt coins, that is real-time and doesn't have the lag of moving averages. Or use your gut. Whatever. Ideally, more than one thing.

What you use to decide, is far less important than sticking to it, and not reacting to daily news, rumor, blips, or short-term trends. Because changing your mind and cycling back and forth, defeats the whole point. Your ‚Äúin‚Äù vs ‚Äúout‚Äù cycles, in hindsight analysis, should very approximately sort of line up *in duration*, with macro market bull/bear cycles - but overlapping more or less half-way in between as a very crude guide. (And if you've judged the length of the cycles more accurately than an error of many weeks, then you need to be betting your retirement fund and children's‚Äô college funds on leveraged futures trading, because you may be clairvoyant!)

DCA‚Äôing in is easy. Reverse DCA‚Äôing out is significantly harder. At least psychologically. (And even structurally - many tools aren‚Äôt really set up to automate it, which might be a reflection of how bad we are at it and what a low priority feature it is.) 

The idea of Reverse DCA out, is to sell fixed shares, not fixed $ (otherwise you‚Äôd literally just undo what you did with DCA). So yes, ""DCA out fixed shares"" is a misnomer, or self-contradictory.

Anyway, DCA-out is emotionally harder, in part (I think) because we all want to sell at the peak. Somehow we all seem to intrinsically understand that we can't time the bottom, but think we will hit the jackpot by timing the top!? Do I have that generally correct, or is that just my own personal delusion awareness?

But unless you have the Time Stone, or get very lucky (which will happen now and then), you generally can‚Äôt, and your sanity and portfolio will suffer by trying to time the market.

Does this work for me? Yes. I‚Äôm reasonably disciplined about it, but I make occasional stupid impulse decisions periodically that undo *months* of hard disciplined gains. (And I even quit trading while drinking two decades ago. I love beer, but not even a single sip while trading!)

If this stuff were easy, we‚Äôd all be crypto-billionaires. I'm not a crypto-billionaire. I don't realistically expect to be able to retire or quit my day job, on crypto - even though I've been in it for over eight years. (Because I didn't treat is as seriously as securities investing, until much more recently. I thought BTC was technically fascinating, but a tulip bubble I didn't want to get wrapped up in. The real-world utility of ETH changed my mind on crypto. We all have our unique reasons and tipping points. I don't want to get bogged down justifying mine.)

That's the thing about lotto-scale ""get-stupid-rich"" opportunities. Unless you create it yourself, put up the initial funding, or get incredibly lucky by buying a bunch for cheap and then totally forget you did so for ten years - it's by definition practically impossible to know what's going to be the next Google, Apple, or Doge. And therefore pointless to beat yourself up over the inevitable so-called ""missed"" and/or ""squandered"" opportunities that every one of us will experience many times throughout our lives. Just because your tweaker cousin Carl says he has the inside track on the Next Big Thing, doesn't mean it will pan out, and if you invest in every one, you'll soon be homeless.

So, in the end, the key is to have a plan, not constantly emotionally short-circuit it, and disciplined execution. Just as you‚Äôve heard a million times. Eat your vegetables. But if you do accidentally eat a quart of ice cream in one sitting, don‚Äôt just give up. Get back on the vegetables.","Out of funds ""buying the dips""?

&amp;#x200B;

I do drugs, yeah. I like amphetamines or better to say, stimulants in general. 

A substance that was particularly addictive to me was cocaine. Right now I don't care that much about it anymore, its way to expensive, if I had right now the choice to invest 80 ‚Ç¨ in coke or in crypto, I would go for crypto. (Hehe all the C's make you addictive,  coke (crack), crystal, coffein, crypto,)

But yeah, what I wanted to say: During the big crash, I sold at some point (still at a win in general), so I had 3500 Dollars (Bc I paid out in BUSD, not in Euros).

People went crazy on the xrp discord, reddit was going to kill elon musk, twitter was outrageous, the whole world got destroyed in a blink of an eye. 

But still, after the initial crash, random shit started pumping (Can't name anymore the coins I saw going crazy, but a lot did)

I was talking with somebody during that time on the discord. He told me that he was invested in ""HBar"". Had a look at the chart, saw some bigger green spikes forming, I told myself ""Fuck it, all in, maybe something funny will happen"". I bought Hbar for 0.34417 cents, 3500 Dollar. 

And I'm telling you, 2 minutes after I went in, Hbar had this massive upwards spike all the way up to 40 cents. 

I am just sitting there, not being able to think correctly, I can clearly feel how a feeling of joy, a feeling of greed, this kind of greed started to unfold,  which felt like; ""MORE BECAUSE ITS AWESOME!"". It was a crazy rush of energy and feeling like the best in that moment. Rising to 0.38, 0.39, 0.40, in the meantime I got my calculator, doing the math, damn, selling right now, at 0.40 cents, I could have out of the nowhere 600 Dollars!!! 600?. A fucking 4 Minute trade? 600 Dollars? It would be soooo smart to sell now. Go and take it! 

No! I better wait! Maybe there is more. 

Long story short, Hbar dropped after this big time, I could have sold at any point below .40, but I hoped it would stay over my initial investment, but yeah, it went even below it, I was crying, in pain, getting mad. But after an hour or sth like that it went at least over my initial investment, I got even some dollars out instead of loosing with this trade. But hey, I did not get the 600 Dollars. 

These precious In-4-minutes-600-Dollars. 

Because I was basically craving stronger than I ever had before on cocaine. I was craving for more dopamine, I was craving for more. 

Guys, what I want to tell you with that: whenever you get a trade like I did: smack yourself, and sell. fucking sell. Don't get greedy. You got the chance for additional 600 Dollars? Fucking sell. 

Sure thing, if it went up higher afterwards, you would be mad at yourself. But then maybe get the initial investment out. Idk. But don't be stupid and greedy and cocainehigh like me and just keep waiting. 

The thing is: I knew at that time the risk got higher and higher with every second. But my brain switched to another mode. And this mode was dangerous.

The ratio of Moons to karma

The all important Moon to karma ratio. Multiply this number by your karma to determine how many Moons you receive. (Round 12 - 0.88 [Never Forget](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mvzv9v/anyone_remember_that_time_last_week_when_the_moon/))

This number will naturally decline over time as the Moons released per round reduce by 2.5%. The drop in karma this round has been good for the ratio though and put it just over 0.3

Number of users on .CSV

This shows the number of users who earned karma for each round. The lower orange line is users with an active vault at the time the .CSV was published.

The number of users with vaults averages around 43% per round. This doesn't indicate that only 42% of the users claim their Moons though as you have 6 months from the distribution to open your vault and claim them.

CryptoCurrency,"If you are into crypto-currency for about 5 minutes, you will have seen the advice to get a hardware wallet.

I wont say getting a hardware wallet is necessarily wrong, but its not a cure-all solution, I saw two reports of hardware wallet users losing funds recently.  For one thing, your ownership of a hardware wallet identifies you as someone who has enough crypto-currency, to warrant buying a hardware wallet.

But whether your funds are in an exchange (boo!), in a browser based API wallet (oh dear), in a light/SPV wallet (OK-ish) or in a full-node (yay!) or even in a hardware wallet (no comment), some of the  risks come from your basic computer and network security.

Your Router

That unloved ugly box in the hall-way, with the funny aerials sticking out of it, is your primary defense against the unfiltered internet of horrors.  Your router will be scanned multiple times a by by bots, looking for vulnerabilities.  Question is, is your router secure?  Is the password the stock one from when it was new (oh dear), is the last firmware update over a year old (oh dear), can your ISP do ""remote support"" (OMG, no!), are you letting applications use UPNP to open your router ports (Nnnnnoo.....!).  Whats the worst that can happen though?  A compromised router can redirect all of your traffic, to any site the attacker wishes; fake site to login to your favorite exchange, no problem, fake site asking for your seed phrase, no problem (users of hardware wallets reportedly lose funds this way!).

Your Computer

So assuming your router is in great shape, your computer can still get you into trouble.  The router is the thing stopping the nasties coming in uninvited, but if you are downloading malware to your computer, then that is actually dialing back out, and the router generally cant do anything.  The best thing you can do here is have a computer you only use for crypto, nothing else, no emails, no general browsing, no games, definitely no porn or file sharing!  Yup just crypto.  Also you wont want to be on Windows, its a security nightmare, use a copy of Ubuntu (or any Linux distro) and you will be a lot safer.  If you dont have spare hardware, you can ""dual boot"" a Windows to Ubuntu as well, when you start the computer you can choose which to use.  The risks here are similar to a compromised router, a compromised computer can redirect you to fake sites, capture keystrokes etc.

Your Browser

Inside your nice Linux OS that you only use for crypto, it may feel pretty safe, and its not bad, but can we do more?  Lets use a good open-source browser, say Firefox or Brave (we are in crypto, we dont need open-source explained, amirite).  No extensions unless those that are completely necessary, and maybe the EFFs HTTPS Everywhere or equivalent; HTTPS drives secure connections between you and the website, preventing eavesdropping, credentials theft.  

Another good feature is DNS over HTTPS (DoH) or DNS over TLS (DoT).  The Domain Name System that actually helps your browser turn the website name into an IP address, can itself be compromised; standard DNS queries are not encrypted, your ISP or another ""middle-man"" can intercept your web requests and point you to a fake website.  Using DoH or DoT can encrypt your requests to DNS providers like Cloudflare, Quad9, OpenDNS and others, meaning you get to the site you expected to.

Your Credentials

Even with all these other things, if all your usernames and passwords are the same ""cryptonoob1234"", then compromise of any website (even if its not your fault) can lead you to having major problems.  See if you have been compromised (yet) on [https://haveibeenpwned.com/](https://haveibeenpwned.com/)  The simple solution is a password manager, there are many but BitWarden is open source (yay!) and if you have a tin-foil hat, you can even host it yourself.

2FA is another critical defense.  This second credential will stop your password leak being useful.  There are different kinds of 2FA, SMS is by far the worst (but better than nothing), using an OTP app like Authy can really be great, and of course you need 2FA on your critical password manager login!  You can also get physical devices like Yubikeys and hardware wallets can do this function too.

Is that all?

No, this is just a really high level roundup of cheap/free basics, there are many more things you can do from VLANs, intrusion protection, domain white-listing, recursive DNS servers etc., but they are much more advanced, need special kit, and might cost you some money.

There is no TL;DR for security, if you don't do it, you aren't secure.

I'm not saying sell now, but this is not the type of dip I'd be interested in buying. Volume is very low.

In the past Kanye Wests' albums have almost always lead to an insane price surge in crypto, this is presumably because of the excitement that comes from listening to them and no, this is not something I am making up, there is irrefutable evidence which supports my claim this.

Two main examples go as follow:

1. Kanye West's Yeezus album back in 2013 released right before the massive price surge during the bull run,

Now I pay him in cryptocurrency and it cost me around $1. Imagine all the people who send money overseas every day?!
It will also create an environment where inventors, artists and innovators will be paid fairly for their creations. Think of someone in advertising. The one who creates the ad doesn‚Äôt make the money. The big media does. This will change with cryptocurrency because of peer to peer transactions and smart contracts and NFTs. That‚Äôs a big rabbit hole but an amazing speculation of the future‚Ä¶ The arts will be free, uncensored, and more fairly paid.

Every major country will have their own cryptocurrency soon, but those will be centralized and controlled by the government (or central banks). They don‚Äôt like bitcoin and Ethereum and other ‚Äúalt coins‚Äù, alternative coins, because they are Decentralized to varying degrees. And the problem until now is that transaction times were very slow. Changes are happening this month that increase transaction speed faster than Visa! 
And people will say the crypto market is a bubble just like the Internet bubble. This is true. There are 7400 different coins you can buy. Only a few will survive. A lot of money will be lost in coins that represent projects that will never succeed. But people see a buy in at $.50 and think if it goes to bitcoin level they will be millionaires, so they dump all their cash and it dries up. I stick with Ethereum because it is the only cryptocurrency coin that is a valid Blockchain with thousands of decentralized applications built upon it. It‚Äôs like buying the land in NYC before it was a city and letting companies build on your property. The idea is to buy Ethereum and never sell. The idea is to make passive income off holding and lending and staking your asset. 
But what if cryptocurrency doesn‚Äôt get adopted? It‚Äôs happening. J.P. Morgan, Visa, Fidelity, Guggenheim, and many others are all buying in and preparing to offer it to their clients, even in a traditional IRA. Major institutions are setting up funds so people can invest in cryptocurrency using traditional methods because that makes people more comfortable. People will be able to have exposure without holding their own cryptocurrency. That is one way to do it, but if institutions are investing, they will still be in control. The only way to take control is for individuals to hold crypto themselves. But of course, these institutions will only make crypto exposure available to their wealthy clients first. Hmmm‚Ä¶ Fidelity Investments is hiring an additional 70% workforce for their new crypto division. They are all hiring experts in the field and then saying in the media that crypto is ‚Äúnot a legitimate asset‚Äù. They are manipulating the market to get all the retail investors (individuals) to sell and then they can buy at lower prices. That‚Äôs why this is a good time to buy. I don‚Äôt know if we have hit bottom yet. But I don‚Äôt want to miss the run up because it‚Äôs going to be epic. Of course, if you sell, you are responsible for capital gains taxes.

There will never be any more created, and in contrast Ethereum is beginning to burn some of their coin every time a transaction is made in order to become an inflationary asset.

CryptoCurrency,"The Vechain platform contains two distinct tokens: VeChain Token (VET) and VeChainThor Energy (VTHO). The former is used to transfer value across VeChain‚Äôs network, and the latter is used as energy or ""gas"" to power smart contract transactions.

VeChain states that its goal is ‚Äúto build a trust-free and distributed business ecosystem platform to enable transparent information flow, efficient collaboration, and high-speed value transfers.‚Äù

VeChain is an enterprise blockchain platform that aims to provide a full view of an organization by disintermediating information from data silos. Supply chain data for business processes are currently compartmentalized in silos among multiple stakeholders. This affects information flow, which is again divided among stakeholders.

According to VeChain‚Äôs white paper, blockchain technology can break ‚Äúthis asymmetric information problem and allow ownership of data to return to and empower its owner.‚Äù The VeChain platform claims to provide a 360-degree view of necessary information linked to a product and its business processes‚Äîsuch as storage, transportation, and supply‚Äîto authorized stakeholders and create greater market transparency.

For example, the platform can be used to track quality, authenticity, storage temperature, transportation medium, and last-mile delivery of a medicine pack or an alcohol bottle right from the manufacturing facility through to the final delivery to the end customer. To accomplish this goal, VeChain uses smart chips or Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tags and sensors that broadcast key information onto the blockchain network that can be accessed in real-time by authorized stakeholders.

The application of sensors means that all parameters related to the product can be constantly monitored and problems, if any, can be communicated back to the relevant stakeholders. Manufacturers and customers are informed if a drug packet is stored outside a prescribed temperature range, allowing for service improvements and better quality control.

VeChain also plans to become a leading platform for ICOs, dApps, and for conducting transactions between Internet of Things (IoT) connected devices. 

VeChain makes use of two tokens: VeChain token (VET) as a value layer and VeChain Thor Energy (VTHO) as a smart contract layer.

The VTHO token stands for VeChainThor Energy and is also known as VeThor Energy. It is used to power transactions on VeChain and is equal to the cost of conducting transactions on its blockchain.

The concept is similar to that of Ethereum‚Äôs ether and NEO‚Äôs ""gas"" in that developers need to budget for a certain number of underlying tokens (which are not exposed to the public) in order to conduct transactions for their decentralized applications. Per VeChain‚Äôs white paper, the two-token system was devised for effective governance and to have a predictable economic model for decentralized applications developers.

In its current form, Ethereum lacks such a model because the price of ether, its native gas token, is volatile. As such, developers have to estimate the amount of ether required for a transaction. The transaction fails if their estimate turns out to be incorrect. VeChain‚Äôs white paper outlines several technical enhancements that its platform has made to overcome this problem.

While VTHO is also volatile, and it‚Äôs price is open to market speculation, a consensus can raise or lower the amount needed to execute a transaction. They recently changed the gas price, reducing the required VTHO for a transaction by 100x. 

There has been a great deal of speculation as to how this would affect the price of VTHO, and the bear market came shortly after the transition making it difficult to gather useful data as to how the price of VTHO would change with the reduction, however with cheaper gas the door to new partnerships and business adoption opens wide. 

VTHO is not in fixed supply, meaning VET holders generate a fixed amount of VTHO every day. VTHO is also burned with every transaction on the network. This means the supply is always in flux, and can adapt to wider business adoption without affecting businesses or investors, as the speculative price can rise without the cost rising for businesses.",Let‚Äôs talk about VTHO,1626801741
CryptoCurrency,"Since most posts on this subreddit lately seem to be meta reactions to other posts on this subreddit, I thought now might be a good time share some information about stablecoins and the economic / market risks that entail.

Perhaps the biggest advantage that stablecoins have is their ""atomic settlement.""  This is the fancy, financial way of saying that the money arrives *immediately* and, more importantly, is available to be sent out again *immediately.*  Remember the last time you made a check deposit into a bank account? You had to wait a few days before you could spend the entire amount. You had to wait for the check to ""clear.""  Well, the benefit of stablecoins is that you don't have to wait.  

Banks are extremely excited about this. It means that money doesn't have to spend as much time 'in limbo' between transactions. It means they can invest it immediately, borrow immediately, keep less cash on hand to cover settlement gaps (allowing them to invest more without increasing risk), etc... by using atomic settlement, banks stand to significantly increase both their profit and their stability. This is why the FED is excited about blockchain technology.  

To understand why this is great for financial institutions, consider this: if all of the customers of robinhood, robinhood itself, and the GME clearinghouse all had atomic settlement, robinhoold wouldn't have been forced to halt trading on GME because robinhood never would've maxed out their credit line used for bridging the gap between when customers make deposits and when those deposits are finally available.  In short, with atomic settlement, robinhood wouldn't *need* a line at all for money to send to the clearinghouse to purchase the stock because all of the customer deposits would be available to them *instantly,* rather than a big chunk unavailable while waiting to finish clearing. They might've frozen it anyway, if you're inclined to believe the more conspiratorial views, but they wouldn't have been *forced* to due to lack of available funds to use for purchasing the stock for their clients.

Atomic settlement is great. So great, in fact, that its technology has led to the average stablecoin changing hands at approximately 20 to 50x the rate of a regular US dollar.  The economists out there refer to this as the ""velocity"" of the currency.  While this is great (to keep this post on-point, I'm going avoid discussing inflation) for the economy, it does present us with some new risks as well - the extreme velocity of stablecoins means that rare, outlier events can *happen faster* and with less warning.  Let's discuss what those might look like:

Right now, the collateral for stablecoins is held in a variety of places ranging from commercial paper (usdt / tether) to bank accounts (usdc / circle). The biggest concern that the government has with stablecoins is the possibility of financial contagion. Let me explain:

The vast majority of stable coins keep their pegs through the market making actions of the sponsoring companies. If USDC goes from $1 to $1.01 due to demand for USDC, Circle company will create new USDC, sell it in the markets (which brings the price back down to $1). They then take the actual US dollars that they sold it for and deposit that into bank accounts.

The issue isn‚Äôt when usdc goes above 1. The issue is when usdc goes below 1.

Yes, for every 1 usdc coin there is approximately $1 US dollar deposited in a bank account. But what if there is a run on USDC? Circle Corp has the collateral, so theoretically they can just keep withdrawing the $ US dollar from the bank and using that to buy and retire USDC, bringing the peg back up to $1. So what‚Äôs the problem?

The problem is that there is a metric shit ton of USDC out there. 26 billion, to be exact.

Now think about this not from usdc / circle‚Äôs perspective but rather from the perspective of the bank at which the collateral is deposited. Does that bank have *all* of that money on hand *all* of the time? No, of course not. They‚Äôre a bank, and unless they‚Äôre a special crypto-specific bank chartered in Wyoming, they are lending a good chunk of that money back out so that they can make money on the lending interest.

So imagine there‚Äôs a run on ethereum, which turns into a run on usdc. Circle is withdrawing from their bank deposits to buy usdc on the market and retire it. They‚Äôve withdrawn (for example) a billion from the bank so far and have 25 billion left in deposits. But, unfortunately for them, the remaining funds aren‚Äôt available *at* the bank because the bank has leant out. *That's what banks do.* Circle, even though they have ‚Äúdeposits‚Äù at the bank, can no longer withdraw their deposits. The bank has to close for the day. It‚Äôs a bank run‚Ä¶ which will then cascade into a run on another bank, and another, etc. stock market crashes, panic ensues.

Keep in mind that throughout this whole process, the bank is moving funds with a delay (regular settlement), whereas the need for funds is instant (atomic settlement).

The high velocity of stablecoins means that a run on them would happen much faster and with much less warning than a regular bank run.

If we apply this to tether, there is the possibility that significant selling of commercial paper could damage the ultra-short portion of the bond market‚Ä¶ selling large amounts of commercial paper would certainly tank prices in the short term, however I think the bigger issue is that eventually the buy orders would all be filled and the market would lose all liquidity temporarily. Inventory (read: liquidity) is a much more limiting factor in the bond market than for the stock market, and as someone who trades bonds professionally I can tell you that things can dry up *much* faster, both on the sell side and the buy side. I don‚Äôt think this would have as disastrous spillover effects as the bank run, but it‚Äôd be a problem for any other entity looking to sell commercial paper at the same time. The bigger issue is that for tether holders, if there‚Äôs a run and the commercial paper is being sold, the value would temporarily drop below par, making tether undercollateralized. This is fundamentally different in cause from many of the conspiracy theories which inaccurately state that tether hasn‚Äôt been audited (it has, just not very thoroughly), but functionally the end result for tether users is the same.

This is what the fed is worried about. The size of Collateral deposits for stable coins and the velocity of said stablecoins has made some of them literally ‚Äútoo big to fail‚Äù because if they do fail then there‚Äôs a chance they‚Äôll take everything down with them. 

The solution? To *require* stablecoin companies to deposit stablecoin collateral into silo'd banks (silo = their deposits are held separately and are unavailable to borrow) or to only allow the collateral to be held in non-lending banks. Why would stablecoin companies not want to do this? Because then they wouldn't be earning any interest (remember that banks are only able to pay out interest because they make a profit on lending out the deposits).  The income the stablecoin companies receive would be significantly impacted - it would be limited to the income from their market-making activities (selling at 1.01, buying at .99, etc).  That's not bad, so don't feel too sorry for them, but it is a significant decrease.

As a 19 year old still in university living in Ontario, Canada where the housing market is completely fucked and wages have been virtually frozen with respect to inflation, I honestly feel like I got nothing much to lose here but only everything to gain. Also, I don't know about the rest of you in this sub but I can't help but feel excited and ahead of the pack when I put my shit fiat money into the future of finance. 

A lot of people may say that what I'm doing could be deemed as stupid or even very risky since they would say ""only risk what you're willing to lose"". Well to that I say that having a mentality like that has 1 foot out the door energy in all honesty. Think about it. If you really believe in something, you wouldn't even have doubts about it or any hesitations. I definitely don't. Especially with crypto. Governments and institutions can spread as much FUD as they want but their actions the past few months have only grown my confidence that I am in the right space. 

The foundation is here and only continues to be rigorously innovated. Institutions are gobbling up millions of $$$ worth of the crypto that we all know and love! They know that something special has been created and have taken advantage of their institutional powers to maximize the current situation and continue to build their portfolios in order to stay rich. 

To that I say fuck the institutions.

To those in my generation and everyone else just trying to get a grasp of the wealth in the world, our time will come. Wealth and financial literacy is changing right in front of our eyes and everything about it will be revolutionized within the next decade, if not sooner than we think. 

Times like these are what separate those who want to make money and those who want to be rich. I have dreams of owning a home and having a family.  I live in a country where there is genuinely no realistic way for any of us in Gen Z to buy a house on our own anymore through a 9-5. I don't expect financial help from my family either. Paper money is depreciating in value by the second, and despite having some money in the stock market, the returns and freedom you have in that market are laughable compared to crypto.

If you bought BTC at 60k or ETH at 4k, but you're not buying more now, you are investing purely based on emotions.

You should take this time and truly research what this space is about and the revolutionary technology you're investing in.

If this is your first time investing and you're scared watching all your money go down the drain- I completely understand. I'd be scared too. But that loss is only realized when you sell. Remember this really important fact, everyone who bought the very top of the last cycle are still in the green today.

Hi all! Just want to start by saying MUCH WOW! Awesome community.   
completely in love with crypto, the people developing the technology and the community surrounding it. I started GPU mining in January and put some of my profits into Doge. Was lucky enough to cash out enough to buy 2 HNT miners (Bobcat 300) that are on their way. Also purchased a 3rd with profits from BTC/ETH GPU mining. I've invested in a 5700XT and 2070 super (for games and mining when its not in use).  
I've started using a visa from crypto.com which is super awesome and makes crypto a lot more useable in day to day life. It also makes it a lot easier to talk to other people about crypto because they understand VISA. Makes the conversation more approachable and less intimidating for casuals.  
Seeing BTC/ETH balances build while GPU mining, anticipating my IOT devices. Seriously an amazing space. My friends are starting to get into it as well, we're working together on the IOT devices and it's just awesome. Feeling the love, seeing the results and looking forward to where this can go! Honestly a huge change.   
I'm a pretty dedicated FIRE EFT guy; for me, crypto is a closed financial system separate from my regular income etc. I won't put anything in - investing and reinvesting with the stuff I mine and earn.

\-Has a decent risk of being tied up in an asset for several years where I would lose money if I'm forced to sell at the wrong time.  
\-Has a decent chance of showing good returns if I'm patient.  
\-Has a slim chance of showing incredible returns if I'm really patient.

But also, this phrase means different things depending on how you decide to invest in crypto. If you're investing in only BTC and Ethereum, chances are you'll never truly lose that money if you're patient and wait until the next bull run. If you prefer playing the slots and invest in shitcoins, then it really does need to be money you're willing to lose entirely. It seems like most of us are somewhere in between, with some or most of our portfolios in safer coins, and a certain percentage reserved for gambling.

I think right now we're starting to ask ourselves what we're really able to lose, or at least have tied up for several years if the bear has truly returned.

CryptoCurrency," I'm somewhat new to crypto and I've been on various crypto related groups on facebook, telegram, discord and so on, and it seems like most people are into crypto just for fiat gains (which coin is mooning, always remember to take profits and whatnot). I'm not just talking about pump and dump groups, but even the largest crypto channels on youtube are always on about increasing your portfolio and making money (fiat).

I'm curios if anyone here has a longer term perspective on crypto, like potentially replacing the fiat system at some point in the future, or using the blockchain for something completely different than just money/value transfer.

people say Bitcoin has been adopted by many institutions and yet they only buy BTC for the exact same reason you buy BTC (to sell it at higher price to greater fools). people say Ethereum is truly useful because it's been used by DeFi and yet people seem to forget that other users use DeFi only to buy shitcoins and/or to get higher APY on their stablecoin returns (and this higher APY is only achieved because of other speculators buying the native token of that DeFi platform, which is kinda proving my point about speculation and greater fools theory).

CryptoCurrency,"The very phrase ""buy the dip"" is itself, in the same zoo as ""FOMO"" - an emotion-based sentiment. (Arguably. At least as often used in context here.)

Just to get this out of the way first though: *Any* plan that in part relies on ""dry powder"" from the profit-taking in a previous run-up (which is good if that's your strategy), may eventually run out of purchasing power on an extended bear market, without extra cushion or ongoing infusion.

But this is far from ""extended"" yet. So if you are out of funds now, take it as potentially valuable learning opportunity to either compare your plan to actual execution, or to make a plan in the first place.

""Buy and hold"" isn't a bad strategy. Plus it helps stabilize the market. 

But is it really a ""plan""? Sure it could be part of one. But if it's just part of a vague ""buy the dips"" and then hodl concept, then that's probably not really a plan. Or at least, you could probably be doing even better, with disciplined execution on a simple, solid DCA plan.

I would encourage you to just *consider* the possibility that a singular focus on ""hodl!"" *could* - just maybe - be rooted in fear. (But I don't know your motivation personally. Just think about it.) For example, fear that you might panic-sell. Fear that you won't be able to get back in. Etc.

Hodl can be a good part of a plan, don't get me wrong. Personally, I move a fixed % of what I buy to ""permanent"" hodl wallets, and the rest for DCA. That seems a good balance for me, personally.

A good DCA plan is a simple one. You can just DCA in and hold. That's a legit plan, but vaguely ""buying the dips"" is not an optimal DCA strategy.

You might also consider adding Reverse DCA out. If even just for half of your wallet. (Or a dedicated wallet that gets half of your DCA in. One wallet for DCA-in-and-hold, one wallet for full DCA in *and* out.)

The three parts of a full DCA strategy:

1.	How often and how much to DCA fixed $ in.
2.	How often and how much to Reverse-DCA‚Äôing fixed shares out.
3.	How to know when to do which.

Regular Coinbase, while staggeringly expensive, is the only big exchange I know of that you can schedule regular purchases on. Don‚Äôt even look at the charts, just auto-purchase, directly from your bank, a fixed $ on a fixed schedule. The high fees are worth that convenience, hands-off-ness, and peace-of-mind to me. (But I also love Kraken and more sophisticated orders - and way cheaper! - for my less frequent coin DCA schedules.)

But when to switch from in to out? 

Well...DCA in whenever *you*, personally, think the market is generally undervalued - on the scale of at least several weeks to months. Axiomatically if overheated, then Reverse DCA out.

You could literally just base your entire strategy of when to DCA in or out, based on a Simple Moving Average, eg 50 or 100 day SMA. DCA in, in the bowl, out in the dome. (At the time, evidenced by changes from increasing or decreasing slopes. Either do the calculus, or use your pretty good eyeball calculus-ator.)

Or whatever floats your boat. Use the ‚ÄúBTC Rainbow‚Äù for general market sentiment, even for ETH. Use your gut. Whatever.

Just don‚Äôt cycle rapidly, or it defeats the whole point. Your ‚Äúin‚Äù vs ‚Äúout‚Äù cycles, in hindsight analysis, should very approximately sort of line up in duration, with macro market bull/bear cycles. (Plus or minus many weeks. If you are consistently more accurate than that, then you need to be bettingyour childrens‚Äô college funds on leveraged futures trading!)

DCA‚Äôing in is easy. Reverse DCA‚Äôing out is much, much harder. At least pychologically. (And even structurally - many tools aren‚Äôt really set up for it, which might be a reflection of how bad we are at it and what a low priority feature it is.) 

The idea is to sell fixed shares, not fixed $ (otherwise you‚Äôd literally just undo what you did with DCA.)

It‚Äôs emotionally harder, in part because we all want to sell at the peak. But unless you have the Time Stone, or get very lucky (which will happen now and then), you generally can‚Äôt, and your sanity and portfolio will suffer by trying to time the market.

Does this work for me? Yes. I‚Äôm reasonably disciplined about it, but it would work way better, with more discipline. My occasional stupid impulse decisions periodically undoes months of hard disciplined work. (And I even quit trading while drinking two decades ago. I still love beer, but not even a single sip while trading!)

I got completely ruined in the dot-com bubble. It was really, really bad. (And I was really, really dumb.) But I applied those lessons learned and fared a little better in the ‚Äò08 crash, and a little better yet with BTC in ‚Äò17. Not perfect, not ideal, not financial-advisor guru-well. But I survived and was happy with myself. 

But if this stuff were easy, we‚Äôd all be crypto-billionaires. The key is to have a plan, not constantly emotionally short-circuiting it, and disciplined execution. Just as you‚Äôve heard a million times. Eat your vegetables. But if you do accidentally eat a quart of ice cream in one sitting, don‚Äôt just give up. Get back on the vegetables.

(BTW. I don‚Äôt do moons. F‚Äî moons. Maybe they‚Äô‚Äô‚Äôl make a few of you actual money somehow. But to me it seems like a distraction, a centralized antithesis to what this sub is allegedly about, and degrades the discussion quality of this sub - at least relative to the rest of reddit. But that‚Äô‚Äô just my opinion.

Just imagine going back to that time and buying Bitcoin for 100$, just for it to crash to 4$. You've shat your pants. It was the era where there was no institutional investors, let alone a country.
The general consensus was that crypto was for buying drugs alone. The sentiment was the worst. 

However, those early investors still managed to HODL and go through the dips. They have rightfully earned their gains through their strong convictions. No one has the right to say they were ""lucky"". They went through anything we will ever face now.

CryptoCurrency,"I guess you can say this for about 98% of crypto but this one in particular has me baffled with all of the reply guys in the comments. I will show you below why I think Litecoin is dead.

They claim Litecoin is not dead but the LTCBTC and LTCETH pairs have been in a downtrend ever since the beginning of time.

1)

https://preview.redd.it/o6kzib3pydc71.png?width=1457&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e2f97bc58b499442a1b587bed8de809557429d08

On the left, LTCBTC didnt even budge from the lows before tanking. LTCETH on the other hand looks horrendous.

2) LTC and Doge are merge mined and the reply guys/ bag holders love to mention this useless fact. Elon endorsed Doge and the hype surrounding his marketing is what sky rocketed doge. Litecoin does not have that marketability (something the LTC community hates btw). 

They claim the similar pump will happen just because the patten before the breakout looks similar

&amp;#x200B;

3) Declining hashrate and poor fundamentals

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9i218copzdc71.png?width=1852&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3974f06412bb6df483a7fb9b83c2102a5a64234a

Before Litecoin touched its previous all time high, the hashrate barely got to its 2019 levels and also its 2018 levels. People will try and counter this point by saying the # of active wallets is going up, however that metric simply could mean someone is buying and converting coins it doesnt necessarily mean people are buying and holding.

That also brings me to me next point which is the dormant supply of LTC went up by a huge amount. But this also doesnt mean that people are buying and hodling. Grayscale was buying a ton of LTC, BCH and ETC and their respective dormant supply was going up but it didnt reflect in the price at all.

Grayscale buying was supposedly a good thing for LTCs price but it didnt have the same effect as ETC (which was mainly backed by Barry Silbert hence the price increase) 

&amp;#x200B;

4) Charlie Lee

Well we all know the infamous Charlie Lee sold his coins story. Somehow the LTC hodlers paint this as a good thing as now this makes LTC more ""decentralized"". Not only is this stupid but also just an insane amount of copium and heres why.

If Charlie held the most amount of coins, him selling doesnt make it more decentralized because this just means some other whale will scoop up the most amount of LTC which makes this person have the most control over the price. At least knowing the face behind the whale would make things more transparent as a hodler and make them accountable for the coin overall. 

The next thing is, Charlie selling has really shaken the confidence of new buyers as when they google to learn more about LTC, the first thing they will see is the fact that Charlie sold. Let me ask you, if you are new to the crypto currency world would you buy LTC knowing the owner abandoned the coin as a ponzi scheme or invest in a coin that has many devs and an owner who is passionate about his  creation.

&amp;#x200B;

Final Thoughts

LTCs poor movement compared to other majors in this past bullrun has shown the publics disinterest in the coin. The BTC and ETH pairs have forever gone in a downspin and look absolutely terrible.

CryptoCurrency,"Brief intro: I'm a 3rd world country economics student a from Argentina. I write mainly about inflation and it's problems (my country has 50%+ inflation, so I live the topic daily). Everyday I do research about a certain topic and publish the results at the subreddit, usually a good exchange of ideas comes at the comments. I do this to share knowledge/create good content. Please correct my spelling mistakes as this helps improve my english! Hope you enjoy! 

This is more of an idea than a deep analisis. But mainly the question in my head was, why are no miners coming to Argentina?

I know we have an unstable economy, 50% inflation, capital flow controls among other problems. But when mining you are paid in crypto and this makes it much easier to avoid the dirty hands of our corrupt goverment, you can transfer you BTC almost instantly for example, so you have very low financial risks.

Most importantly is this factor: electricity is really, really cheap because the goverment subsidizes it. For example, my family pays 10 dollars of electricity a month. If I'm not mistaken, as the electricity cost is the hardest burden for mining, I think this could open up a series of opportunities for foreign investors and also crypto enthusiasts within the country. Although the cost would be paid by the goverment but I really don't care because they are corrupt as hell and steal everyday.

Regarding that, I want to know if anyone has experience in mining from home with small operations. I have about 1200 dollars saved (4 months salary) and I want to know if I can start mining at small scale with that. (Preferably if anyone lives in Argentina and has done something similar). As I think this could be a great boost to my income at a potentially low cost (maybe 5-15 dollars a month in electricity?). For those that mine from home, what devices/models do you use? (I literally have no idea regarding mining other than you need to cool it and you need a strong first investment).

I will do a Q&amp;A in the comments in the following hour after publishing the post while at work. You can ask about our economy, my experience with inflation and the economic impact ithas (we have a pretty interesting economy).

CryptoCurrency,"This post is kind of ranty, so my apologies in advance if my thoughts are a bit disorganized. 

The age-old question: should I sell? All indicators point to us entering a bear market (for however long) - selling now seems like a no brainer, right? But in my experience trading crypto over the last four years, I‚Äôve gotten burned pretty much every move I make ‚Äî sell to buy lower but price goes up, buy more before a pump that never happens, HODL through a 90% crash because you‚Äôre scared of the missing a relief pump that never happens ‚Äî it‚Äôs all a bad move without the gift of hindsight. Day trading is honestly just a game of slots - I‚Äôm sure there are some people who make a living off of it, but I‚Äôd just call them professional gamblers. I don‚Äôt need that kind of stress.

My strategy now is simple - stake all my -insert coin here- to prevent me from panic selling and DCA weekly regardless of current price until I‚Äôm ready to sell at my target price. I‚Äôve been holding my bags for too long to risk the next (in my opinion) inevitable bull run.

It‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm using this money anyway, so I honestly shouldn‚Äôt care if the $$$ amount goes up or down. I know others may not be in the same situation and maybe invested money that would really harm their lives if they lost it - but that‚Äôs the old saying right? Don‚Äôt invest what you can‚Äôt afford to lose. ü§° 

So, I‚Äôm just going to kick my feet up, watch the entire crypto space burn, watch my -insert coin here- amount go up from DCA and staking, and then start paying attention to the dollar amounts in the next cycle. As far as I‚Äôm concerned, I am happy to consider crypto as my Roth IRA account that I won‚Äôt see until I‚Äôm retiring at 65, decades from now. Even that much is okay with me, and still better than traditional investing opportunities. I believe in the fundamentals of -insert coin here- and eventually the fundamentals will become relevant again.

Hopefully my outlook helps those who are struggling psychologically with the recent downtrend.

Here are some bonus take-aways from my time in crypto:

1) don‚Äôt invest the money you need to buy food with or pay for your kids‚Äô education with

2) invest only in coins whose fundamentals you‚Äôre excited by!

3) set up a weekly investing plan to DCA

4) 1 coin = 1 coin. USD amounts don‚Äôt matter if you weren‚Äôt planning on getting rich any time soon, anyway. Trust in the fundamentals of whatever coin(s) you‚Äôre excited by, and if the fundamentals end up not being all that great in the long run, well that‚Äôs just part of investing.

5) Stay away from shitcoin tokens unless you love losing money. Some people have made insane returns on meme coins but, believe me, the stress is not worth it. You‚Äôre basically playing a game of chicken with the inevitable rug.",My Investor Psychology,1626796539

The discussion will be focused on key thought leaders in the space explaining how institutions can embrace crypto, how to overcome the hurdles blockchain technologies have, and destigmatizing FUD-fueled narratives around it.

CryptoCurrency,"I am one of those who bought half of my crypto at ATH back in May, basically BTC and ETH and a couple others (looking at you ADA), and I have DCAed since. Looking at the current market of crypto may be a bit demotivating for some, but not for others, especially for those who have been here for a while. I didn't myself own any crypto until 2020, but I have always followed the stocks and crypto out of curiosity and I still remember when I heard BTC reaching $3K and I was a bit shocked.

From early February up until May, we went from about the current market cap of 1.18 trillion dollars to over 2.4 trillion dollars in a matter of a few months. Everyone was happy back then. Now we are in a point as same as we were in early Feb, although then some could say we  BTC was worth more than now ($33k in 2 Feb vs. $29k today), but if we go back exactly just one month, today's BTC value in dollars was the same as in January the second. 

How about ETH reaching an ATH of +4k dollars back in May? Its current value of $1.7k is still higher than that of just 168 days ago which was about $1.5k. 

The take here is we rose high and quick, and fell high and quick; the only difference is that more people have started investing in crypto than 168 days ago. if took only 168 days to go high and back to our place, where would we be in the next 168 days, lower, higher?

I have, however, immersed myself very deeply in crypto ever since I got started in early June of this year. My brain is no sponge but I'm still dipping that thing into as much crypto knowledge as possible to soak up every last little bit I'm capable of and will continue to do so. I follow several credible YouTubers that follow crypto as well as on Reddit. I created a Twitter account solely for crypto where I follow absolutely nothing non-crypto related. I've targeted a couple crypto projects I truly am interested in and believe in after much research and pool some funds into that while DCAing into ETH, BTC and a couple other alt coins. I don't currently day trade or anything of the sort but eventually I might dabble just a bit for fun. I'm largely in it for the long haul but wouldn't mind some short term gains to pay off this or that.

That said, it goes without saying that all the crypto nerds I follow and all the research I do yields quite a bit of bearish news/opinions especially these days. Everyone always stresses ""Hey, just hodl, DCA in, buy the dips and chill"" or something to that effect, which I am absolutely doing. We all know the paper hands out there are shockingly prevalent and to ignore those silly folks and all the weirdos that sell at the lowest of dips - the same people who bought BTC at 60k wishing they had bought at 35k and now that we're at 30k they're bitching out and won't buy.

Allllll of this and the inevitable FUD has me entirely unphased and not because I have some superior knowledge of the market and where it's going based on TA and historic trends and this and that.

The law proposed by the European Commission, the EU executive, would apply what is known as the travel rule to crypto transactions to make them traceable.


The rule, which is one of the recommendations of the inter-governmental watchdog, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), already applies to wire transfers.

""Today‚Äôs amendments will ensure full traceability of crypto-asset transfers, such as bitcoin, and will allow for prevention and detection of their possible use for money laundering or terrorism financing,"" the Commission said in a statement.

A company handling cryptoassets for a customer must include the customer's name, address, date of birth and account number, and the name of the person who will receive the cryptoassets.

The recipient's service provider must also check if any of the required information is missing.

Providing anonymous crypto-asset wallets will also be prohibited, just as anonymous bank accounts are already banned under EU anti-money laundering rules.

""These proposals have been designed to find the right balance between addressing these threats and complying with international standards while not creating excessive regulatory burden on the industry,"" the European Commission said.

CryptoCurrency,"First of all, I should mention that I have BTC, ETH and ADA and I'll be hodling long term. Second, crypto is about 15% of my investment portfolio, and diversification is critical to any long term investment strategy. Third, I'm using some eyeball trendlines to begin this analysis, and there will be no fancy patterns, but there will be some machine learning (ML) and predictive analytics later.

This all started a week ago, when I realized a distinct bear market forming with a slow but steady declining pattern in BTC chart in the last 3 weeks or so. Then I decided to run some ML algorithm I built for stock analysis and saw that the model was predicting below $30,000 price action in the next 10 days. (This analysis was done Friday). As of this writing, the BTC price indeed fell below that . I decided to not heed the model predictions because another TA I did earlier was showing a great support at $31,000 and I honestly didn't think it would fall below that. Now that we are below that the short term BTC became really bearish. But long term I'm still bullish, not because of any specific tweet, but because of what the chart is telling me. Here is the explanation:

&amp;#x200B;

[BTC - All time logarithmic chart](https://preview.redd.it/v126ersx6dc71.png?width=1058&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f150048ff46fb335dc08aa0c078826c743eabb7f)

If you look at BTC all time chart you can clearly see the exponential ascending trend . In the chart if we look at the channel, we can also see the overbought territory on late 2017 and underbought region in early 2020. That is where you should have bought BTC. If you FOMO'ed like me in 2021, tough luck, because the new support is not forming till \~$22,000. In the short term the price may consolidate till September. If you have been DCA'ing keep doing it, but I really don't see an upside if you enter the bear market with a large lump sum. Why is the long term bullish? Because if we actually bounce back from that support and remain in the channel, then this baby is gonna go to $100,000 by the end of 2022 or early [2023.](https://2023.Now) 

Now let's look at very short term price predictions. For that, we utilize ML (or buzzzword AI, if you want to sound fancy). I actually used a technique called Elastic Net, which is super simple so calling it AI is an insult to data science community. Anyhow, here we give the machine a bunch of features, like, the open/close/high/low prices for the day for the past history and ask the machine to learn the patterns and then predict the future prices.

&amp;#x200B;

[BTC 10 day prediction](https://preview.redd.it/qwao4ljvpdc71.png?width=648&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=58162c4e214f4c206755e79465132193f46e6dc7)

In the above figure, you'll see that the blue line is the historic prices, and the orange line is the future predictions. As you can also see, as of this morning, the machine is predicting a steep downward trend in the next 10 days, and also predicting a price range of $26,000. 

Based on this prediction I'll stop my DCA strategy for the short term and wait to see some bounce back before jumping in again.

TL,DR: Bear market dudes. If you're DCA'ing, grrreat. Don't jump in with large sum. It will potentially consolidate towards $22,000. Next 10 days can be brutal, wait for an upswing. Long term, bullish as heck. $100,000 in the next year and a half.

CryptoCurrency,"This David vs Goliath mindset sets in during bear markets because we all need someone to blame. Price falls do not mean that some big bad wolf is pulling strings in the background. In fact, the very reason that crypto is an appealing investment (1000% gains?), is exactly the same reason that we dip HARD in bear markets.

As of right now, Bitcoin market cap is right around $550B. If Bitcoin were a company, it would be solidly in the top 10 of the S&amp;P 500. If you take BTC and ETH together, they would be fighting for a slot with Google for #5 based off valuations [from last month](https://www.investopedia.com/top-10-s-and-p-500-stocks-by-index-weight-4843111). 

BTC isn't a company, and ownership doesn't have the same implications (or restrictions) as ownership of stock, but we are still taking about MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF MONEY. Its hard for ""Whales and Institutions"" to influence the price significantly. Additionally, anyone who is buying up crypto in super large sums in this day and age is a sophisticated investor. Sophisticated investors are very mindful of risk, and they are not likely to take a bath on their crypto portfolio to add a few more BTC or ETH for the long term. They may re allocate a few times a year, but I think it's unlikely they are letting a bunch of capital reserves sit idly while they try and manipulate the price all the way to the bottom. They have a plan, and that plan probably relies upon their long-term outlook for the investment, with pre-determined levels for taking profit or cutting losses. Groups who (maybe) have the ability to manipulate the market, are  not reckless with a volatile asset.

At the end of the day we all need to know what we are investing in, and why we are doing it. I strongly believe in crypto tech, but I also recognize the risks involved. Manipulation in an asset this large is not  impossible, but don't convince yourself that is the only reason for dips such as the one we are seeing. Bear markets happen for a variety of reasons, but make sure you know what the most likely of those are. Try not to find a scapegoat, but instead think critically about the market pressures that lead to this. It'll make you a better investor long term.

Has anyone used Heiken-Ashi candlestick patterns in their trading strategy for crypto? I'm considering using a mixture of DCA for continued investing and Heiken-Ashi for putting bigger bids on in lows, but wonder what folks' experiences have been.

When I look at the 1 Month Heiken-Ashi for BTC I'm seeing  the start of a potential Crypto winter as the RSI is just hitting 70.

When I look at the 1 Week Heiken-Ashi I'm seeing two Bearish signals and next week is looking likely to either be a confirmation of another Bear cycle or another consolidation phase - a sustained upswing doesn't appear likely.

The 1 Day Heiken-Ashi also indicates a Bearish cycle start, but the RSI is right around 30 indicating a good time to buy - potentially a few days of stagnancy/consolidation.

Anyway, looking at several time spans and historical data of Heiken-Ashi to me it seems like a the Bear cycle will continue with potential of a Crypto winter. But 2021 is not the same as 2013 or 2017. Perhaps with Crypto gaining more mainstream traction and technologies getting increasingly more advanced maybe a Crypto winter is unlikely.

I'm currently researching about ***what are the factors that could influence investors' perception of cryptocurrency investment and their decision in investing in Bitcoin.*** I am building my conceptual framework and I really need help with the variables related to Economic factors. 

Based on the existed literature review, I spotted that some suggested investing in crypto can be an *""alternative"" for savings as well as a portfolio diversification tool.* However, these have not been proved in the context of investors' perception of crypto investment. 

I'm kinda stuck in finding reliable sources and thinking maybe it's because I did not get the right keyword.

CryptoCurrency,"Bitcoin is a distributed ledger that is split into blocks which are sent to nodes who save it and store it. Each block is simply a bunch of transactions from wallets. A block is generated every 10 minutes by miners who perform hash functions to achieve the target difficulty. 

When the block is hashed by the miners it uses sha-256 encryption which is a 1 way cryptographic function which turns any length of data into a 64 digit hash key (256 bits). The hash of the previous block is also included in the header of the current block to allow you to go back and verify the order of blocks and to also make it increasingly harder for anyone to go back and change past transactions. 

The miners hash the contents of the block but if the resulting hash isn't equal or lower than the target they try again increasing the nonce. The nonce is simply a number used once which is added to the block to see if it matches the target, if it doesn't the miners try the next number. The first miner to hash the block with the correct nonce that results in a hash below or equal to the target is rewarded with bitcoins. The miner who wins is allowed to publish the block and all the other nodes on the network store it. 

The rewards are decreased every 4 years to maintain a stock to flow model similar to physical gold, by the year 2140 there will be no more rewards given out. The difficulty for mining is also increased (or decreased) every 2016 blocks (about 2 weeks) to accommodate for changing total hash power of the entire bitcoin network, this is to ensure that a block is produced every 10 minutes on average. 

The changing of difficulty is simply the amount of 0's at the start of the hash target for miners. If you don't want to mine bitcoin to acquire it you must go to an exchange and buy it from someone who wants to sell it for fiat money. When you own bitcoins it is stored in a wallet on the network with the entire history of your bitcoins being traceable to when they were first mined.

Your wallet is only kept safe by only you knowing your keys to your wallet, if anyone else has access to them then they essentially have your bitcoins. You can own a hardware wallet which stores your keys offline and never leaves the device to ensure maximum safety.

Many people mistakingly think that bitcoin is anonymous but in reality it is pseudo anonymous as everything is public just without your real name. As long as you never share your wallet address online with identifying information like you name no one can know who owns your wallet, but they can still see your balance and every transaction you have made.

Please let me know if there's anything I have missed.","A description of bitcoin - I've been studying for a few months, is this a good description of what bitcoin is and how it works?",1626791476

Fast forward to December of 2020 and I became interested again. I managed to learn about Coinbase and Bittrex and bought my first coins there. I was enamored with the idea and the way that it worked.

At first, I really liked the ease of use and being part of a financial system that I think will go on to challenge traditional sectors in finance.

The first 5 auctions of Kusama came to an end! So far 6 parachains are live on Kusama (a blockchain platform or a relay network as they call it). They already are producing blocks and one of them even distributed its native token to the backers of the crowdloan.  


The  first parachains which have launch on Kusama are : 

1. **Statemine** (a parachain designed to help other parachains to deploy different types of asset. This one was integrated outside of the auctions for being a common-good parachain)
2. **Karura** : A Dex with a stablecoin, a liquid virtual KSM asset and a native token called KAR which has been distributed to their backers of the crowdloan (now added on Kraken, since about now). 
3. **Moonriver** : an ethereum virtual machine and a set of tools for developers to deploy their blockchains on Kusama, or bridge their assets there.
4. **Shiden** : Brings smart contracts to Kusama and should also bring bridges to ethereum but not only.
5. **Phala** : Private and confidential network. Provides confidential smart contracts. 
6. **Bifrost** : A Dex which also has a virtual KSM type of asset. Let's see how it plays out between Karura and Bifrost in the future.

&amp;#x200B;

To win an auction, projects get KSM from people who want to back them through a crowdloan. They bid the amount of KSM they received  during an auction to get a slot on Kusama as a parachain. Once the slot won, the amount of KSM is locked for 48 weeks. Backers usually receive some rewards in the form of the native tokens of the parachain they helped obtaining a slot, to offset the opportunity cost of not staking their KSM.

around  1.07 Million KSM have been locked so far on the network via the auctions, for 48 weeks, which is around 10% of the KSM supply!  


The Kusama team will check if the network and the parachains are running smoothly, and if they do, a second batch of auction is coming for mid august! 5 new parachain slots will be auctioned so it's possible to help and get in on 5 new projects.

Example:

$100 for 200 coins @ $.50  
DCA = $.66 per coin ($200 / 300 coins)

This is a **scheduled purchase** of an asset **regardless of price**. Sometimes you'll buy more, sometimes you'll buy less. It helps mitigate risk by breaking up your investment so you don't YOLO at what you think is a good price just to watch it fall out from under you.

Basically just shorthand for, ""Don't worry about this 50% crash 'ol chap! if you have the money to spend without getting hurt, you can buy more and lower your Dollar Cost Average. Once the price (hopefully) recovers it will be far easier to take profits or dump the coin if you don't believe in the project! since your break even point will be easier to reach.""",DCA for beginners,1626788403
CryptoCurrency,"Ever since the May peak and the 50% crash that followed the sub has been filled with hopium bois, trying to convince themselves that ""we are early"" and ""we are stil in a bull market dont worry guys"" "" the golden run is still ahead of us!"" ""Buy the dip"".

No.

We had a bull market. It crashed. Now we are in a bear market.

How do you call a 50% drop? It is for sure not a small dip, neither a health correction. It is a crash.

Its understandable, a lot of people bought only recently and some of them -unlucky ones- bought the very peak. Thats ok. You will get your money back. But it wont be tomorrow. Maybe it wont even be this years. But thats ok.

You are in crypto for the long run. Bitcoin will hit 1m. When? Eventually. At current prices that 1m will be more like 400k but thats good too.

The bulls will come back, do not worry. But it wont be tomorrow and it wont be today.

We are in a BEAR market.

I personally dont think it will be as bad as last one. The post2018 winter was very hard for all of us. It was the first bear market for many, myself included. But we knew it was just a matter of time. Bulls will come back.

But now? Now we are in a bear market.

Will it last 3 years or 3 more months? Nobody knows.

Until them, buckle up. Wipe your tears. Count your losses.

CryptoCurrency,"Let me begin by saying that I am an investor and not a trader. So when I talk about liquidation and leverage I am talking about crypto loans and not margin trading.

So here's the story. I personally needed some money for personal expenses (not necessarily an emergency) but dd not want to sell my positions away. That is when I came across the lending platform [coinrabbit.io](https://coinrabbit.io/) which provides instant loans without KYC (I am not affiliated with them in any way and am just a customer). This seemed like a good way to profit from some gains without cashing out. I put my Nano as collateral and received the loan amount in 5 mins.

Unfortunately for me, they have a one month penalty (if you close your loan within one month of availing, you'll have to pay an extra fee). So I decided to pay off the loan after 32 days (which would help me avoid the extra fee).

I had not expected the crypto market to drop today and I am two days away from the 32 day limit when I was planning on closing my loan. Fortunately as I am new to taking crypto loans **I only put at risk what I could afford to lose**. Furthermore, I have a lot of spare nano on the side so I increased my deposit amount which saved me from getting liquidated (for now). Just for some context, in the morning a 5% drop in Nano price would have gotten me liquidated. Fortunately now I have 2 days and it would take a 33% drop in price for the same liquidation to happen (based on market sentiment this can still happen).

**Based on my experience with crypto loans, here are the main precautionary insights I can share**:

1. **Make sure the platform you are using is reliable** and not a rug pull. With new platforms starting everyday it is very hard to judge whether your money is parked in a safe place or not. I had heard good things about coinrabbit and they claim no rehypothecation so that gave me some peace of mind.
2. Make sure the crypto asset you choose as collateral is reliable enough. The incentive to choose Nano was instant loan release because of Nano's speed and fee-less nature. **I made a mistake by choosing Nano as collateral**. Because of its low market cap it is highly volatile. Even bitcoin is unreliable in a bear market.
3. **Taking a loan out on your crypto essentially means you are trying to time the market.** This is because you are hoping the prices don't drop enough in the short term to get you in a vulnerable position. This is definitely a high risk play with limited upside.
4. **Don't take a crypto loan to buy more crypto.** If you take out a loan to buy crypto, you are essentially exposing yourself to the risks of a margin trader. Everything follows BTC and ETH anyway so you are doubling your risks if you buy crypto with your loan amount.
5. Take measures to prevent liquidation. Some common ways to do it would be to **not take a loan on your entire crypto asset and instead save 50% or more in case of a severe price drop**. Depositing more coins later would drop the liquidation price and keep you afloat for a few more days at least.
6. **Have a strong source of income that you can use to pay off the loan** according to the timelines comfortable to you. Make sure you realise that if you are unable to pay off your loan then your collateral is stuck forever and the interest would keep piling up. Just like a credit card loan. 
7. Worst case scenario, **you get liquidated or are unable to pay off the loan. How would your life change?** This is the most important question to answer even before thinking about taking a loan based on your risk appetite and general financial condition. If getting liquidated would put you on the streets or if you are putting years of life savings as collateral, then maybe you need to rethink this and concentrate on the worst case scenario.

**Tldr;** Crypto loans still have a long way to go because of the volatility of the market and high correlation to BTC. Think carefully before taking one. It is very different from taking mortgage on your real estate property. In the future, we might start seeing less interest rates and more stability which would make this viable for everyone.",I might get liquidated for a loan that I'll be able to close in 2 days once I get my salary!,1626787489

CryptoCurrency,"Hello, I want to show you my own coin idea based on my thoughts from few years and show an example as simple as possible of what I'm trying to make.

First of all, I want to create a coin that will be similar to NFT tokens but in basics, it will be mineable so need to adjust few things.

a) Each coin will be serialized with its own letters like AA AA AA AA 

b) Each coin will be made from 4 pieces, and each piece is based on two letters

c) Miners will be mining those pieces instead of full coins.

Now after you mine few pieces there will be a few conditions that need to be met:

a) The full serialized coin can be made only from 4 pieces 

b) Each piece will have a hidden sign for example AAa

c) To form a full Non Fungible coin You need to have pieces with the same hidden sign for example:

AAa aAAb bAAc cAA

d) coins will be formed in alphabetical orders 

There will be a need to trade pieces to gain full coins or if you are enough luck You can mine pieces that will match and you will get a full coin.

I'm still considering algorithm for it but one is sure it will be 100% PoW and like 15 seconds block time.

The main thing is that I post it here because I want to see the opinions of the community and maybe some ideas on how to form my Idea in a good coin.

Burning tokens is believed to increase the price, but there are a number of important caveats:

‚ñ™Ô∏è It works in the long term, less supply on the market = higher rate.

‚ñ™Ô∏è The scarcity of an asset determines not only its quantity on the market, but also the availability of demand. So far, Binance is doing well, there will be demand for BNB üòâ

If you haven't learned anything within the past 2-3 months, go do yourself the favor of taking 10min to study the chart movement of the past 2-3 months.

In summary, this game is not played on the 1min charts. Downwards movement can be planned out over the course of many, many months (or years, see: 2018). The market movers that have ran/manipulated markets for decades know how to keep people interested (see: every other comment in this sub for the past 3 months of buy the ""dip""). They know how to get people to keep buying allllll the way to the bottom as they laugh to the bank and buy back in at prices that are substantially lower.

Look at the macro level outside of crypto. The world markets have just started a downturn due to many different reasons. This has JUST started. When these markets take a shit, crypto will follow. Not every single red candle on the 1min chart is an ideal buying opportunity. Let things play out, stay patient, and you can buy in at lower prices.

Sure, the whales are buying now. Those same whales also bought at $60k. On the other hand, whales are ALSO doing the selling right now. These whales have essentially infinite money, where their crypto investments can go to shit or be held for years on end, while they continue to make millions upon billions from other sources. 

The vast majority of people in this sub are overinvested, and a 70-90% loss over the course of years is a hard pill to swallow. Sure, no one can time the bottom, but I'd sure rather start my DCA within lets say 20% of it vs 60% above it.

We need to build resilient economies because we are designing systems to be run by a decentralised community. The economy needs to be resilient because there is no ""off switch"" to press like there is in a centralised governing community.

The more resilient an economy is, the safer that economy is.

# People, Systems, Civilisation

Systems that we design are propagated by simplifying all the complexity down into some basic rules.

A question that needs to be answered is: ‚Äúresilience to what and for whom?‚Äù Making something resilient is going to impact something else as there are always trade-offs in systems.

People are adaptable to situations such as disasters. What we are doing is to build adaptive systems that capture people‚Äôs adaptability. It is tougher to build resilient systems purely from the engineering perspective because they might not be able to account for the changing environment. We call these incomplete contracts economic.

However, we can add aspects of resilience or adaptability into the design of a system or economics. For example, pairing machines to aggregate data with humans, who can make better decisions based on the mountain of data. The biggest benefit is to create these adaptable systems to take advantage of the strength of both machines and people.

**This is my take: don‚Äôt buy anything yet. Do not try to time the bottom and buy the dips. Wait for the rebound and then buy in on the way up.**

It‚Äôs extremely hard to time the bottom of markets and cryptos are even harder to do this task. There is normal volatility in cryptos, but things are more intense with:

- inflation fears
- COVID-19 recovery/variants
- government regulations
- past pumps/dumps situations (Elon shitting on BTC and pumping Doge/China dumping mining/etc.)

It‚Äôs not so important to buy in at the absolute bottom. You‚Äôll feel better if you wait for the drop to fully happen and the markets to rebound, as opposed to buying in and seeing a loss of 20% on what you thought was the bottom.

**When buying in, do so sparingly.**
Don‚Äôt spend whatever money you have all at once. Pretend you‚Äôre dating someone new and it‚Äôs the first time they cooked dinner. You don‚Äôt slam you face into the plate and swallow it all in one go - you nibble at the sides and eat sparingly as you figure out how to lie to them and tell them it tastes amazing. When you are buying in do it incrementally.

""When in doubt, zoom out"".....the people saying this daily are  the same people who said BTC will be $100k EOY so buy more. ETH 10k so buy the dip, ADA $3 SO BUY THE FUCKING DIP

Every single influencer has revealed themselves to be full of shit and incapable of making accurate price predictions. They  shill coins that they hold and dump when you buy into their hype.

Zooming out brings little comfort to people who are down 50-90%, but it is a reminder that you need to HODL. Blockchain technology is great and will revolutionise our financial system and bring so much more usage and application to the internet, so buy into good projects. 

Be honest with yourself; you lack the skill, time and discipline to trade or make decisions on technical analysis. Do your research. Thoroughly! Don't just check a few videos of people shilling a project and telling you what you want to hear. Read the white paper. Make a decision on if the project has a real world use and if the team is dedicated. If you can't do this or don't know how: learn before you buy anything

Zooming out shows you that the biggest gains were made by HODLing over 5+ years. So, since we're in a bear market: buy, stake, HODL and thank yourself in 5 years time

I put together a list of hot wallets applications that these communities recommended/use the most that are not Atomic, Exodus, or Trust. Granted, a multi asset wallet may be the best choice for certain assets.

A few things to keep in mind. At this point we all know that cold storage on a hardware wallet is the safest way to store your crypto. That being said, hot wallet applications do serve a purpose and there are many to choose from. 

I personally believe a native or official wallet is the best choice when available. There is no single wallet that will serve all purposes. (Governance, staking, defi, etc)

It is important to understand that your wallet is actually your private key or seed phrase, wallet applications allow you access and manage your cryptocurrency. You can import your seed phrase to other wallet applications that support the crypto you are trying to access. Any wallet that supports the Ethereum blockchain can hold any Erc-20 token. Some applications support multiple chains for coins/tokens. 

Always double check which chain you are using. 

Any storage method is only as secure as your safety practices. It‚Äôs up to you to secure your assets.

This is not a complete list of every wallet or every crypto. This is a list of the most popular assets in the top 100 and the most used/recommended wallet applications excluding Exodus, Atomic, and Trust.

CryptoCurrency,"**What?**

When faced with a loss of any kind, but usually the ones that have the potential to seriously affect mental state, human brains delve in the 5 stages of grief: denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance. Basically trying to shelter yourself from loss by way of mental tricks.

&amp;#x200B;

**HODL** **In trading**

The [initial HODL post](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=375643.0) summed it up perfectly. All it takes is one mistake on when you sell to mess it up and lose even more money, while holding will make sure you lose nothing when it goes up again (which is what everyone hopes).

&amp;#x200B;

**How**

*Denial:*

I believe being afraid of messing up and losing the (of course it will!) bounce up is what makes people HODL, deep down. That's because they can't afford to lose even more money than they have already. 

*Bargaining*

They usually attribute themselves noble characteristics denoting strength, like ""diamond hands"", or a sense that they are helping others by doing so. Maybe helping a cause? This stage gets merged with other personal beliefs, like anti-government sentiment, destabilising the ""old system"" and so on. Bargaining!

*Anger:*

At the same time, ""traders and whales"" become natural enemies, the group that gets blamed, to try and deflect one's own responsibility. ""It's not my fault"" goes hand in hand with blind hope (denial stage).

*Depression and Acceptance:*

memes, selling, becoming a sworn enemy of 'magic internet money' maybe

&amp;#x200B;

**Why**

I'm partial to believe HODLing is just unmitigated, ignorance or lack of knowledge fuelled, pure fear. Fear of failing, fear of the unknown, doubt, anger at one's self, sprinkled with lashing out at others. 

Peer pressure also has to do with it, being ridiculed by strangers who were also afraid and then validate their choice when someone messes up. In the same way that a large enough group of people with the same feelings can persist in validating each other's choices, even though none of them have any clue about the future. Having order and a belief system, even if it's fundamentally flawed, is easier to cope with than accepting chaos and uncertainty. 

This also means that whoever breaks the norm from the continuous wishful thinking is encouraged to leave, since the group's system of coping is already fragile enough (FUD).

**Analogy**:

It is believed that when sensing danger, an ostrich might choose to bury its head in the sand, hoping the danger would go away. 

Some ostriches might flee and get eaten, because they've attracted the predator's attention. So that validates the hiding ostrich's choice. 

But if they'd all flee or if they'd all stay put, one of them would surely get eaten too. 

In the end, the result is the same, but the perception is not. 

Majority rules above reason.","Grief, ostriches and crypto",1626782945

On his sixteenth birthday the boy gets a horse as a present. All of the people in the village say, ‚ÄúOh, how wonderful!‚Äù

The Zen master says, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll see.‚Äù

One day, the boy is riding and gets thrown off the horse and hurts his leg. He‚Äôs no longer able to walk, so all of the villagers say, ‚ÄúHow terrible!‚Äù

Look, I get it, everyone wants to be bullish, and for sure, there were more people proclaiming a never-ending bullrun, than urging cautious pragmatism. That is the whole reason behind the [Fear and Greed Index](https://alternative.me/crypto/fear-and-greed-index/). You want to sell in times of greed. And to be honest, you want to buy in times of *boredom*, not fear. When everyone is panicking, that means we can go further down. When everyone has left and given up, that‚Äôs the time to start buying - in the long, boring, months where nothing seems to be happening.

When everyone is irrationally exuberant, you get drowned out for saying the opposite. That itself is a sign of confirmation bias, and one you should be looking out for.

I just did a quick search for dissenting voices from the last few months. There were many more, especially in the daily, but this at least proves that yes, some people thought we were nearing a top (if not *the* top), and yes, some people took profits before the crash.

# My point

It‚Äôs quite easy to be dismissive of TA because in the short term, it‚Äôs just noise and essentially useless. Additionally, I‚Äôd guess that many of the people on this sub have been here less than six months. That, by definition, is short term. So I understand the scepticism. However, over a longer period, THERE ARE patterns. Not exact ‚Äúsell here, it‚Äôs going down tomorrow‚Äù patterns, but ‚Äúit‚Äôs been going up for months, we‚Äôre really far from the moving average, every single indicator is saying we‚Äôre near a top, the fear and greed index is at maximum greed, there are memecoins everywhere, this really feels quite a lot like 2017, possibly it‚Äôs a good time to gradually take profits over the next several weeks‚Äù pattern. To dismiss TA is one thing, to deny the fact there is even such a thing as ‚Äúoverbought‚Äù or ‚Äúoversold‚Äù is another. Everything follows cycles.

I‚Äôm not saying sell everything now, just be aware of a few indicators for next time. 

# Bonus Post

Back in December 2017, there were a lot of posts from longterm hodlers that they were cashing out. Just like now, they largely got ignored. In fact there were so many, that someone made this Grade-A shitpost, mocking them:

Even though we still have time to reach $200k end of the year, as a veteran, I think it is wise to sell now and FOMO back in when when you see the price go up.

Let's start:

We are in an obvious Bear Market, and still far from the bottom, not strictly because of the price, but because of the timing.

Many people talk about accumulation/consolidation period, however this is not the case, since there is no show of a resistance level, and actually there are only lower highs:

CryptoCurrency,"I don‚Äôt know if you guys knew this ‚Äúfeature‚Äù, but I think I found a way to maximize your BAT/hour income.

So you know you can set a maximum of 5 pop-up ads per hour, which gives you 0.010 BAT for every pop-up. This requires one of this two actions: browsing for an hour or leave the computer on for an hour. Sometimes we don‚Äôt have that hour to browse, and leaving the computer on it‚Äôs a cost of electricity, which is not worth it.

Well, I found out by browsing that if you open a new window on the browser, sometimes appears a background ‚Äúad‚Äù image, which gives you 0.010 BAT even if you open the window and close it immediately. If you repeat this action, you‚Äôll see at least 5 images (maximum per hour) and you earn the same amount of BAT in 2 minutes rather than 1 hour (0.050 BAT)

CryptoCurrency,"1. Hold On for Dear Life (HODL)
HODL, is currently used in chatrooms to signify the intent to hold onto crypto for dear life.  Meaning, do not sell your crypto at any cost.

2. Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt (FUD)
It's hardly surprising that what some dub the wild west of investing has its own acronym for the whirlwind of nervousness and apprehension that can come with it. The fact is, this is such a new industry that we can't be sure how it will pan out. This fuels constant rumors that the end is nigh -- or that Bitcoin (BTC) is about to rebound to its all-time highs.
You'll also see accusations that people are ""spreading FUD."" The connotation here is that they are deliberately sharing false or misleading information to influence a coin's price.

3. Fear Of Missing Out (FOMO)
That anxiety you feel when a coin on your watchlist suddenly jumps in price and you wonder if you should buy it so you don't miss out on any further gains? It has a name: FOMO. A lot of people who hadn't bought crypto had a severe case of FOMO back in March when prices seemed to go nowhere but up.
FOMO was officially added to the Oxford dictionary in 2013 and applies outside the crypto world, too.

4. Going to the moon
Crypto investors hope their coins might go to the moon. It's a stratospheric growth that sends the coin's price off the charts -- to the moon. Also known as mooning, you'll often find the term in memes and Reddit forums.

5. Diamond hands or paper hands
Serious HODLers have diamond hands -- referring to a diamond's ability to withstand enormous pressure. People with diamond hands do not sell, no matter what. In contrast, if someone has paper hands, they sell at the first sign of trouble.
On forums, having paper hands is usually used as an insult. But the truth is that sometimes it does make sense to sell a bad investment, even if you've lost money. It all depends on your investment strategy and personal situation.

6. Whales
Cryptocurrency whales own enough of the currency to have an outsized influence on the price. Back in 2017, about 1,000 people owned 40% of all the Bitcoin in circulation. Many of these Bitcoin whales bought into crypto early. Famous whales include the Winklevoss twins, Tim Draper, and Michael Saylor.

7. Do Your Own Research (DYOR)
Do Your Own Research.  It‚Äôs okay to watch Youtube, twitter, celebrities and chatrooms express their interest about certain crypto currencies, but in the end, you should ‚ÄúDo Your Own Research‚Äù before buying any crypto assets.

8. Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA)
If you bought $500 worth of MATOC (250 coins) at $2.00 and the price dropped to $1.00, you should purchase another $500 MATIC (500 coins) at $1.00.  This strategy will bring your overall cost of each coin $1.33.  So it is ‚ÄúVital‚Äù that you DCA when the price of your original purchase dips considerably.  This is how you ‚Äúaverage‚Äù out the cost of your original purchase.  

9. Know Your Customer (KYC)
Know Your Customer, refers to the verification process that customers go through in order to: Verify their identity and link it to a cryptocurrency wallet‚Ä¶and get a better understanding of the potential customer's activities in order to determine whether or not transactions are legal in nature.  KYC Verification has become less favorable over time.

10. Anti-money Laundering (AML)
While cryptocurrency means cheaper, faster international transactions, it also makes the crypto sector ripe for criminal activity, such as money laundering and terrorist funding. To stay ahead of this, regulatory bodies are installing anti-money laundering (AML) legislation.

11. (Copium)
Copium is a combination of Cope and Opium. It refers to the use of a fictional drug to help deal with the loss of your crypto currency.  

12. (Hopium)
HOPIUM is combination of Hope and Opium.  This refers to a fictional drug that gives you courage and confidence to dive into the market and hope for the best.

CryptoCurrency,"I see so many post arguing whether we are in a bull or bear market. The truth is nobody knows. 

But at the end of the day, unless you are day trading, it shouldn‚Äôt really matter to you if you if you think as an investor.

Warren Buffet famously said: ‚ÄúThe market is a machine for transferring wealth from the impatient to the patient‚Äù.

And this is happening now. Investors buy into assets / projects they really believe in and then just hold. Imagine buying Apple or Amazon 10 years ago? You enjoy growth and dividends for more than a decade. Some would argue the best time to sell and asset you believe in is never! Borrow against it if you need liquidity.

For cryptos it‚Äôs the same if you approach it as an investor. Only buy project you truly believe in. Do extensive due diligence before buying in and HODL for 10 years or more. Even consider forever (seriously).

Favor projects that allow staking and enjoy the payouts. (Beware or projects with huge staking rewards. If it‚Äôs too good to be true it probably is).

Of course a word of caution is necessary on the due diligence part: many crypto asset projects are scams or have very week value proposition. This is why careful due diligence is so important and should consist of more than watching a couple of videos on YouTube. If you consider investing for a long time favor projects that have already survived a market cycle.

Next, as an investor, you should only invest money you can afford to lose. This will give you peace of mind when the price goes down below your purchase price  (and it will) because you won‚Äôt be forced to sell at a lose. 

Consider DCA (dollar cost averaging) to increase your position, particularly when the price goes below your initial purchase price but again, only money you can afford to lose or won‚Äôt need in the short term.

Last but certainly not least: if you are not considering holding forever set your moon! In other words set a price at which your investment has reach a value that make your investment successful for you.

If you approach your crypto purchases as an investments all the rest becomes noise. Bear, bull market, TA signals, FUD‚Ä¶ won‚Äôt matter.

The only thing you should do is follow the project you invested in and ask yourself this: are the news I‚Äôm reading from reliable source about my investment make me want to continue hodling forever or not?

This research aims to highlight the problems of women in the cryptosphere. The gender gap is very high here, and the latest market analytics show that women make up only 5% of the total number of crypto users globally.

The female audience has not been researched by companies that offer services and products in the crypto industry. Startups spend their efforts on attracting men only. The study aims to address this issue and explain how women in the crypto industry make decisions.

For this purpose, group interviews and questionnaires were conducted: more than 400 women from 28 regions participated.

# Key insights

Every third lady found herself in the cryptoindustry thanks to interaction with informants from her personal circle (spouse, colleague, or friend). Also, this decision is influenced by the abundance of news about the crypto industry and workplaces in this sector.

The main reason for mastering the cryptosphere is to improve one‚Äôs financial situation (this is relevant for more than half of the respondents). Moreover, ladies want to try something new (50%) and become financially independent (44%).

Women either invest in cryptocurrencies or store coins. Less than 20% are involved in trading.

One of the most attractive features of cryptocurrency is freedom. It means a great choice of coins for investment and limitless personal account management.

Projects are selected according to two criteria: capitalization and practical application of the project.

Pretty often, women in the crypto industry face FOMO. However, some inevident factors prevent them from entering the crypto market: joint bank accounts and online communities where men behave improperly.

More than 70% of respondents complained about the lack of training materials for beginners.

CryptoCurrency,"First time buyer here, came into crypto a few weeks ago, catching slightly better prices than the ATH and DCA-ing the last few weeks. I‚Äôm a little surprised to read people calling this a major crash and stressing big time over this week‚Äôs swing. Don‚Äôt get me wrong it‚Äôs not pleasant to see a portfolio in the red. But let‚Äôs be clear here: the cryptos I am holding are barely hitting some of the ‚Äúdip‚Äù value they had a month ago. Some are about what they were worth 3 months ago on average. And even if they dropped to mid last year value, some would be losing ‚Äúonly‚Äù 70% of value from their ATH.

Folks, you‚Äôre not buying the S&amp;P500 here. And even those who do play in the stock market have experienced last year what it‚Äôs like to see a market melt (and rebound). Right now what we‚Äôre seeing is at most cute compared to some of the pains and joys we‚Äôre going to experience in the next few years here.

The bottom line for me is simple: this is crypto. It‚Äôs a rollercoaster ride. You don‚Äôt start sweating when you‚Äôre 30% or even 50% down- that‚Äôs table stakes for something like this. You can‚Äôt just invest in something that can shoot up 300% in a matter of weeks and not be able to stomach 40% declines. 

Honestly where we‚Äôre at right now is just regular DCA, we‚Äôre not even at an ‚Äúaggressively buy the dip‚Äù event for many of the coins, there‚Äôs still plenty of margin for it to go down. 

If you‚Äôre losing sleep over what‚Äôs happening, it probably means 3 things:

1/ you came in hot and put all your money at once around an ATH and you need to learn how to DCA when entering volatile positions. One simply does not get to Mordor with a lump sum when the market is at ATH. Take a breath and get yourself ready for another investment later (if you plan to stay in crypto). It sucks, but hopefully you‚Äôll have learned a valuable lesson. 

2/ you‚Äôre not diversified and put all your money and hopes on crypto, which means you‚Äôre not ready to lose it all and see the swings. At the end of the day it‚Äôs your decision and your money, but there is a reason why highly volatile positions are never advised for your total retirement plan. At most, buy crypto the way you buy a TV screen, settle for what seems comfortable and buy a little over that. But don‚Äôt go buy the IMAX screen for your 400sq ft studio apartment. Stay within your means and be happy you could get in.

3/ you‚Äôre not ready for investments like crypto. You‚Äôre new to investing and don‚Äôt know what it‚Äôs like to lose money (even if you don‚Äôt sell it). Either you are investing because you believe in the long term and know that sweat will be about those years, or you‚Äôre investing in the short term and should entirely play this the same way would the casino: knowing it‚Äôs not just about winning the jackpot, it should first and foremost be about having fun. If you‚Äôre sweating and panicking at the roulette table, you‚Äôre at the wrong table. And yes you may have a gambling addiction.

I have no fucking clue if we‚Äôre going to go much lower or much higher. I just know that there is an extremely high likelihood that whatever we‚Äôre experiencing this week will just look like a barely perceptible blip in a few years (probably even in a few months).

At this point i had no choice but to submit a support ticket, as i read the warning that it would take them 24h to get back to me i thought ""here we go"", not expecting a reply for at least a week.

Much to my surprise, i had a reply in under 2 hours which basically said ""Can't do SMS? that's cool, here is what you need to setup an alternative 2FA, your withdrawals will be frozen for 24h after the change but beyond that you are good to go""

This I have been thinking about a lot. Technically your own (cold) wallet is the safest option, however the stories of people getting scammed out of crypto by entering their seed phrase into some website has made me think if the average user wouldn‚Äôt just be best off to store their coins on Coinbase f.e. (Provided they have all the necessary security measures in place). Yes you hear stories about things like sim-swapping etc., but pretty much all of these cases can be traced back to some lack of security in the persons measures, not the exchange (of course same can be said about the wallet option, but that‚Äôs exactly my point then, if it‚Äôs all up to you personally, then it doesn‚Äôt matter much which way you store them).

Also, I see many people are now storing a big chunk of their holdings on centralized services like BlockFi or Celsius in order to earn interest. So far (correct me if I‚Äôm wrong) I have not heard of these services being hacked, I would assume they have the best possible security measures in the world in place, so for people trying to steal crypto, it‚Äôs probably more lucrative and much easier than hacking a service like that.

Make no mistake, we are in an on-going crypto winter. Bitcoin and ETH can easily fall another 50% from here. I've been trading in the markets for over 10 years now and I know how bad it feels emotionally and psychologically to watch your positions fall by 50%, 60%, 70%, 80% etc. 

But there is a huge silver lining here for those of you who can be patient. You are being given the chance to buy before the next bull run/btc halvening cycle, at soon to be rock bottom prices. Imagine you got in ADA in 2019 at 2 cents, and watched your portfolio rise over 100x to $2.40. This is the life-changing opportunity you will be given over the coming months as the bear market continues and culminates. 

You have two choices: as the market continues crashing you can either sell everything in a fit of panic and fear, maybe post up a suicide post or two here, curse crypto as a scam that you will never touch again...

OR

You can accept the fact you were late to this bull cycle, but also recognize the opportunity you are being given to get in early for the next bull cycle in a year or three, and make potentially life-changing gains. If you FOMOd into this past bull market, chances are you didn't put that much money in anyway, compared to what you will be able to put in during this on-going crypto winter. And even if you did YOLO everything, you will be able to accumulate more money in the months and maybe even year over which the crypto bear market is on-going, to put in your favourite coins.

THAT is how most people made their fortunes in crypto. They held on and continued to buying at maasively discounted prices during the 2018 -2020 bear market, and then watched their holdings increase by 20x, 30x, 100x, 1000x etc during this recent bull market.

First of all, if you can‚Äôt pronounce squirrel don‚Äôt worry, it means you are not a native English speaker and it‚Äôs normal.

What I‚Äôm about to tell you is well known by all the whales, banks and the IRS, definitely the IRS. The small shrimps were never supposed to have this information so get ready to be blown away.

As a professional cryptocurrency analyst (part-time ex-google, ex-facebook employee) I have dived into all the information available. (YouTube and twitter) I have also done extensive research on the colors green and red but mostly on candles.

Did you know that the most expensive wax for candles is beeswax? It costs 10 times more than cheap ass paraffin wax!! That‚Äôs like a 1000% increase in price in crypto! That‚Äôs nuts! 

\#whyredcandles? was one of the highest trending hashtags on twitter the past months so I started my research there. I found that many people were calling the current market a ‚Äúbear market‚Äù. I wanted to know more but I had a lot of trouble finding bears in my country and also, I am scared of bears.

So I decided to study squirrels instead. Pretty scary too because those little fuckers are fast as hell, but I managed somehow.

Now what I found was that during the day, the squirrels went up the tree (green candle), stayed up there for a while wreaking havoc and then went back down (red candle). The timings could differ several hours (that‚Äôs months in squirrelyears) for each attempt.

Some squirrels would collect the nuts (coins) from the ground and put them up into their hole in the tree (wallet). The squirrels were really excited by this because of the high return in value. I noticed that sometimes they were collecting nuts (coins) from a branch and then proceeded to go down into their hole. This made them depressed as there was a significant decrease in value.

Other squirrels would just fly around from tree to tree fucking shit up. The real OG‚Äôs would gnaw on the electrical insulation of your power cables which would cause a fire that burnt your house down. They‚Äôd get electrocuted in the process but they don‚Äôt give two fucks.

From my perspective, while Binance is currently limiting transactions in Europe, Binance in all likelihood will resolve this issue by implementing KYC, and working with EU regulators more closely, so this issue seems temporary at worst.

The crypto market looks pretty back right now I think we are all in agreement. If you are sitting there staring at 1m 5m 15m candles its not really good for your health, (unless you are daytrading and scalping but I don't thats very good for you either)

Zoom out a bit to the daily and weekly charts, you get alot more data in each of the bars and its better to understand where we are at.

Daily bars are bearish but this is the third time we are bouncing off the 35 on the RSI indicator in the last 2 months, another rejection would be a good indicator for a turnaround. Also if you look at the daily we have yet to have a shoulder from the initial drop which I would want to see, as well as getting rejected to be fully bearish.

On the weekly we have just dipped under the 50 day moving average, if we can turn that candle into a wick by the end of the week it would be a bullish indicator for me, that would be recovering to about $32,000 for that to happen. Also the RSI of the weekly is sitting on 40, if there is a bounce from there that bullish imo.

On the monthly the RSI is currently where it was at when it was at 10k, 5 months later it was at 60k, just saying.

These sort of market movements have an element of physics to them the higher they rise the lower they fall, and vice versa, and if there is going to be a bullish recovery this is winding up for a HUUGE swing.

Same! So I checked - modeling the returns of someone much wiser than I, if they'd bought 100USD worth of ETH every week over the last few years. Here's what I found:

https://preview.redd.it/mq689215bcc71.png?width=1052&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f06802a68b8a12c826d128100043e466249ace91

Over the last 5 years, purchasing every Friday is the clear winner, while purchasing every Wednesday will have provided the worst returns.

Similarly, over the last 3 years, Friday buys will have put you ahead. 

But what if you started a year ago? Well Friday buys would've performed averagely, while Wednesday buys will have returned the best, despite being the worst day overall over the last 5 years.

And if you started buying at the peak, on April 14th, 2021? The trend almost reverses, with the best buys being over the weekend, and Wednesday -&gt; Friday giving the worst returns.

**What's the conclusion?** There's not much to read into here. You can try follow past trends, but over time the returns from the worst days are all within a few percentages of best days. 

The real takeaway here is that DCA is *fucking awesome.* You could have started buying into ETH at the ATH, and today still only be down 30-23%, despite ETH being down 60%.

Few days ago I started to withdraw from Binance the cryptos I own to stake them in their native wallets if it is possible (ADA, ALGO, VET, etc...).

My idea was to only keep on Binance the BETH (ETH staked) and the cryptos I want to sell when they go up again (CHZ and BAKE for example).

When I wanted to withdraw my Harmony ONE, Binance told me NO ! Withdrawal suspended. Without any explanation of why and when I will be able to do it. It is frustrating because I can't do anything, just wait and hope it will be ok one day.

This convince me more to not let any cryptos in exchanges, so guy when you can, withdraw immediately after you buy if you want to hold ! Having cryptos on their native wallets is always better and secure!

CryptoCurrency," 

"" I was watching, like many of you, a gigantic sell order burning through the bids. Mt Gox doesn't execute trades very quickly, so we were watching this huge order slowly eat up every buy order on the books. The price started at around $17.50, and within minutes was below $10. At this point, I realized this wasn't merely a large seller willing to accept some losses. This was someone attempting to crash the market by selling a huge percentage of the market's total bitcoins at once.

I had around $3000 USD in my Mt Gox account, from earlier sales I'd made. I looked at the market stats, and realized that there were tons of orders to buy BTC at $0.01 that would likely eat up any remaining bitcoins this seller had on the order. I figured if I put a buy order in for $0.0101, my order would execute first and I could buy a huge amount of bitcoins from this seller before it hit the bottom. The only problem was that Mt Gox was running slower than molasses at the time, and everyone was saying that it wasn't accepting trades. I had to try several times, but eventually I got a buy order in, offering to buy as many bitcoins as I could for $0.0101.

The site stopped responding completely for a while, probably from so many people hitting refresh to see what was going on. When I got back in, I saw in my account:

06/19/11 17:51¬† Bought BTC¬† 259684.77 for 0.0101

I had just purchased over 250,000 bitcoins for $2613. At the trading price immediately before this large sell order happened, that number would have been worth nearly $5 million. After I regained my breath, I tried to figure out what to do. I wasn't sure what was really going on. Over the past few days there had been a lot of talk and complaints about Mt Gox's security. Lists of Mt Gox usernames, email addresses and encrypted passwords were being traded around, which was an obvious sign that security at Mt Gox had been breached in some way. If there was an attacker in the system, perhaps he was able to log into my account now and force my account to execute some other crazy trade. ""

My company roasts coffee, we offered bitcoin as payment in 2018 or so, got about 2 orders for novelty and then nothing for years even though it remained as a payment option.

Recently (May 2021) we added Doge and got a few orders.

This interested me more into crypto and I've been researching and playing with trading. I made some money and loss some money - regular stuff.

But I have made money P2P trading USDT for fiat in binance. Obviously a way of making more money in times where our business has been hit hard by covid is appealing. Right now profit is about ¬£200 by playing around but I've stopped trading until I work out if I need FCA registration.

Making the business about ¬£1k-2k a month seems possible with a small outlay. This would make up for loss custom which is all I want.

However, previously looking at this I decided FCA registration wasn't required because of how tiny the amount is compared to regular coffee transactions. On the P2P trading it gets murkier because although I don't plan to make millions the edge I found is 2-3% profit. They are simple quick transactions that make profit. However, let's say I average 2.5% that means for every ¬£25 I make there is ¬£1000 entering the business. And then leaving again to cycle the profit.

Our business is small - ¬£150k turnover. Husband (me) &amp; wife team. To make ¬£2k there could be ¬£80k extra leaving and entering the bank account. That change would alert even the softest of money laundering sensors which is why I thought maybe I should tell the FCA

Registration cost ¬£2k. This would eat up any precious money I have to play with to make money. But the entrepreneur in me is thinking ""if I do register, maybe I can be on the ground floor of something that registered businesses can take advantage of"". But stuff like binance changing or laws changing could mean registration is an expensive admin procedure.

They sound easy, but aren't as easy to conduct because you have to act against the most basic mechanisms of fear and greed.

1. After pump comes dump: don't jump on the train when it is fast and pumping. It's totally okay to leave out this opportunity. Don't become the victim of your greed. The market is a zero sum game. Somebody has to buy the top. And greedy people tend to be the ones. 

Instead wait a few weeks to maybe months, until the price declined at least 50% (trust me, it will). The ones in profit are selling and the ones the majority of people who bought high are scared of even more losses and sell too. 

2. Embrace the fear: overcome your weak mind and buy at low prices. Your gut will tell you it's a bad idea, because 'if it's so low it has to fail'. The truth is, a solid project will pump again. Bitcoin and crypto is deeply rooted by now, and it will always come back. It's basically too big to fail. However this rule is not applicable to shitcoins, it has to be a reasonable project.

I often see in the comments questions like ""What is a bull market"", ""Why is bitcoin growing slowly and altcoins faster?"" I could, as always, send you to Google for answers, but I decided to write a post that talks about the general behavior of the cryptocurrency market.

&amp;#x200B;

The cryptocurrency market, like any other, is cyclical. This means that the market is not in a permanent state of growth or decline. These two states are cyclical. There is a rise cycle and there is a fall cycle. The scale and duration of the cycle may differ from case to case. There are deep and prolonged crises, and there are periods of rapid and rapid growth. An upturn cycle is commonly referred to as a bull market, and a downside cycle is called a bear market.

&amp;#x200B;

We are now in the midst of a bull market. It began in May 2020, when the third Bitcoin halving took place. How long the growth will last - no one knows. There are forecasts that Bitcoin will peak this summer, there are forecasts that this will happen in the fall, and some believe that growth will continue until the end of the year. Regardless of when we see the peak, it is important to understand that growth will not be endless. Sooner or later, the market will go into a downward phase. How strong this fall will be is very difficult to predict. But Bitcoin's average drawdown reaches -80% during a bear market.

&amp;#x200B;

You may have a logical question - why invest in Bitcoin now, if it will then be sold at an 80% discount? üßê Firstly, no one knows how much Bitcoin will fall, and secondly, if you are a long-term investor, then you should not be embarrassed when you buy an asset. Just think, even those people who bought Bitcoin at its peak in 2017 and held it to the current bull market made x3 of the initial investment. History shows that even after the worst fall, Bitcoin returns and breaks new records. üöÄ

&amp;#x200B;

Why is Bitcoin growing slowly now, while Ethereum and other altcoins are growing rapidly? In the cryptocurrency market, in addition to cycles, there is the concept of seasons. The two main ones are the Bitcoin season and the altcoin season. During the Bitcoin season, however difficult it will be, Bitcoin is growing rapidly, while altcoins are growing relatively slowly. But at some point, Bitcoin reaches the ceiling and people realize that there is no way to earn much on Bitcoin. Therefore, there is a massive outflow of capital from Bitcoin, in search of quick and large profits. This is called the altcoin season. At the moment we are in the altseason, because as you can see, Bitcoin has not been making sudden movements for a couple of months, while Ethereum and other altcoins update their historical highs every day.

&amp;#x200B;

To understand global market behavior, you don't need to be a brilliant mathematician-economist with an IQ above 200. All market cycles and patterns are human behavior. If you are able to predict the demand of the general mass of people and understand their psychology, then you can always accurately determine which cycle and phase of the market you are in. Due to this, you will be able to make more balanced and accurate investment decisions. Therefore, as always, I urge you to improve your competence and the level of your knowledge.

If you look at the charts, it becomes obvious that the current cycle is a bit stretched out compared to the previous cycles. This is likely because more people are in the space, so any movements happen at a slower rate. Currently, a lot of people are changing their minds towards ""the bear market is coming"". Which I agree with, but I believe that the real bear market will only set in in \~6 months. Once prices rise a bit again, people will go out and buy ""before we miss the bull run"". Especially the people that bought in on the top will fail to use this opportunity to cut their losses, as they will only want to sell once the price is higher than their entry price. These people will regret their greed once the market is in the next downturn again, and they will sell, contributing to the bear market.

In my personal opinion, the current situation is a gamble that is worth taking. There is a risk that we see a continued decline, in which case I'd sell at \~$27k, cutting losses (-10%). But I see a fair chance that we see \~$45k briefly (+50%). I'd place the odds of experiencing a bull trap before hitting $27k at \~50%, so for me, this is a gamble worth taking.

CryptoCurrency,"Institutional investors are playing a significant role in the markets but we should not underestimate the huge numbers of retail investors, playing an massively important role in the centralization and accumulation of wealth. 

Small investors want to hang on till a crypto 20 x or 100x. Whales are happy to take 2x or 5x and dump. The small-time retail investor gets cold-feet, panic sells, and then the whales buy more and the hunt starts again. 

As for pumping and dumping, in an alternate universe where we eliminate careless speculation that doesn't respect the project, though we would also eliminate half of the investor interest. It‚Äôs the wild west out there at the moment. Particularly with these low cap coins, you can get on a rocket. But it's a bumpy rocket that goes down because whales can come in too, buy a large bag, and then dump and rebuy endlessly.

CryptoCurrency,"What to look for when searching for low-cap gems:

Hi all, just felt like sharing something that I use when I look for new coins to invest for. Bare in mind these should not form part of the majority of your portfolio, these should be rather small capital ventures and if they pay off, they will make up for the ones you were wrong on.

I use coinpaprika.com for all my coin exploration.

1. Total supply:

Always look at how many coins are in existence. Read whitepapers on token economics. How many coins are up for public sale? How many are kept for developers? 
Personally - I do not like it if a coin surpasses the 50 billion total supply mark (just a personal conviction, no real science behind it, more detail in point 4).


2. The volume vs marketcap method:

I always look for coins who rank higher in volume than they do in market cap. Why? Liquidity. For example, a coin can be ranked 450 by marketcap but ranked 300 by 24hour volume. These types of coins are quite attractive as it shows liquidity for a relatively undiscovered coin.


3. Social media presence / Visibility of development team:

Check out their webpage if they have one. Is the development team visible? Sure there are exceptions to this, most obviously being Bitcoin. But for the purpose of low-cap coins it is critical that there is visibility of the development team. This shows both commitment to the project as well as PR.
Think of Projects such as ETH, ZIL and ADA. Thes projects all have a community figure that can rally a community. 


4. The $1 test:

If you feel like you found a coin that you want to invest in, do the $1 test.
If your coin was worth $1, where would it rank by marketcap? Top 100? Top 50? Top 10? Surpass BTC?
If your answer is the latter, then don't expect your coin to hit $1 anytime soon. If a coin can surpass all other coins being so cheap it probably means the total supply is too great.


5. Use-case and target market:

Which market is your coin trying to enter? NFTs? DeFi? Smart Contracts? Cross Border Payments? 
How many other coins are also fighting for a piece of this market? 

Eg. Smart Contract projects are all fighting for a share of the Eth market.

6. DeFi capability:

DeFi will always be attractive for people. If you can stake a coin at a reasonable APR, (not like Iron Finance 700% APR lol), then other people are bound to be attracted to the income produced from staking, if the above mentioned pointers are in place.


What do you use to find new coins? USing the things I mentioned above I have found 3 projects that I really like (Healthcare, Streaming and Payments projects).Hopefully in 5 years time I will not regret putting a little money in each of them.

When I entered, everything was practically at All-Time-Highs, I remember reading articles after articles and researching on the coins that I'm interested in. Bought ETH at 4k, ADA at $2. Used most of my money to buy at those prices, which made me unable to average down more when a crash happened.

During the bull run the only advice I saw was to HODL and buy and how ""we were all so early"" I bought at the peak, then the price plummeted. Then Reddit changed into exit strategies and how it *couldn't have been more obvious* that the bull run was coming to the end.

I felt like such an idiot for believing the hype and owed to never let myself get swept up in the drama. Then the 2021 bull run happened. 

I managed to get my money back from 2017/2018 and kept thinking ""I missed the crypto boat last time, but not this time"". Of course I got in too late and this time put an additional ¬£3.5k (around $4.7k) into questionable cryptocurrencies that either I will never see a return from, or will have to wait several **years** to see a return.

1. ¬£50 is an amount I can very comfortably give, especially in this bear run
2. DCA is a way better long term strategy than YOLOing thousands at once

So once upon a time in a village, a man appeared and said that he wanted to buy monkeys for $10 each. The villagers start to catch monkeys and sold them to him and as supply started to diminish, the villagers stopped their effort. 

After some time, he increased the price for monkeys to $20. Villagers again started catching monkeys. The supply started dwindling even further and villagers stopped.   The offer increased to $25 each and the supply of monkeys became so little that it was even hard to see a monkey. 

The man now announced that he would pay $50 for monkeys but he is leaving for business and his assistant will handle the trades.

In his absence, the assistant told the villagers; that they can buy all the monkeys the man has collected for $35, and when the man returns from the city, they can sell them to him for $50 each.

The villagers got excited and rounded up all their savings and bought all the monkeys. They never saw the man nor his assistant, only left with monkeys!

This was about Crypto Market, now let's talk about goats.

There was another village nearby. Similar to the previous village, a man appeared one day and offered $500 each for buying the goats. 

Goats are valuable, but villagers judged that $500 for a goat is a pretty sweet deal. So the villagers sold their goats to this man and supply started to reduce. 

After some time, the man increased the price of the goats to $750, so the villagers started capturing wild goats to sell them off to the man. Finally, the man increases the price of each goat to $1000, but the supply was very low and villagers were not able to get more goats.

Here also, the man left his assistant to handle the trades, and the assistant offered the goats for $850, which they can sell to the man for $1000 when he returns. The villagers joined all their savings and bought all the goats.

Here too, both the man and his assistant disappeared and never came back. Villagers were left with goats everywhere.

But there is a difference between both the villages.  

Goats aren‚Äôt monkeys. Goats could provide milk every day which can be used for different products and is healthy. The goat droppings could be used as manure. When the goats go grow too old, the villagers could kill them for meat. All in all, it wasn‚Äôt a complete disaster.

But on the other hand, the monkey village is not so lucky. The monkeys ate too much, shouted and shrieked all day, and even sometimes bit people. Eventually, it became clear that the monkeys were worthless, the village abandoned them and tried to forget about their losses.

So if you are a baker your real inflation is  (1+i)/(1+r)-1 what is about -1%. So you are closer to 1% gains with baking Tezos than you are to the highlighted 6 percent. Fun fact: For Tezos the number is equivalent to how many people are not staking Tezos. If every Tezos would be staked the formula would result in +-0.

CryptoCurrency,"
Back in 2013, a friend and I were watching the prices rise and decided that at $200 a piece, Bitcoin looks like a good buy - we‚Äôve decided to ‚Äúinvest‚Äù a few thousand shekels into it. At the time it was difficult to acquire Bitcoin - you couldn‚Äôt just get some with a credit card. There were various creative and tricky ways to obtain ‚Äúdigital gold‚Äù but most were either too complicated or took too long.

The easiest, most straightforward way was through ‚Äúdealers‚Äù - simply buying ‚Äòcoins for cash.

Through a mutual acquittance we‚Äôve received contact details for a prime Bitcoin ‚Äúdealer‚Äù in our area. We were told that the guy is very private and won‚Äôt just sell to anybody. We had to be introduced and meet in a designated location for the transaction. I‚Äôve gotta admit, this sounded really fishy. I couldn‚Äôt help but see the parallels between our situations and a drug deal.

Still, we‚Äôve decided to risk it. We contacted the guy via email and quickly agreed on an amount, meeting time and location. So, my friend and I took out some cash, a laptop, and drove to the designated meeting location in order to carry out the exchange.

When we got there (it was a cafe), we had to wait for about 20 minutes until the guy showed up. We were sitting there, cash on hand, nervous for what‚Äôs about to happen‚Ä¶ Well, whaddaya know? The big bad ‚Äúdealer‚Äù we were nervous to meet was this 13 year old kid sitting on a Bitcoin stockpile that he mined a couple of years earlier when it was easy. We‚Äôve ended up sharing a a drink, making the exchange and laughing at the absurdity of the situation.

That kid made some serious dough - I wonder what he‚Äôs up to today‚Ä¶",What is the most interesting Bitcoin story you heard/ lived through?,1626766503

CryptoCurrency,"**The Golden Ratio**

Some of you may not know about Fibonacci ratios but that's ok. I will not overcomplicate this post and you don't necessarily need to be a TA expert to understand it.

Suffice to say, these ratios, particularly what's referred to as the golden ratio (1.618), are ubiquitous in all nature and cosmos.

Fans of Dan Brown's The Da Vinci Code will remember when the protagonist Professor Langton explains how mathematics and art collide via the 'golden ratio.'

The golden ratio is sometimes called the ""divine proportion,"" because of its frequency in the natural world. The number of petals on a flower, for instance, will often be a Fibonacci number. The seeds of sunflowers and pine cones twist in opposing spirals of Fibonacci numbers. Even the sides of an unpeeled banana will usually be a Fibonacci number‚Äîand the number of ridges on a peeled banana will usually be a larger Fibonacci number.

Space-time itself is defined by this mathematical constant. Naturally, we humans, are somehow programmed to act in accordance with this ratio in everything we do.

**Golden Ratio in Bitcoin**

Bitcoin's price action right now is following the exact same pattern that it did in 2013 and in 2017. Let's take a look. These charts are easy to follow,

[Bitcoin's first big run, new ATH and correction to 1.618 \(2011-2013\)](https://preview.redd.it/j2u8clq9jbc71.png?width=1558&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=74e56a0dc2336f070bfc13ef706b3bdf7b791167)

[Exact same price action between December 2013 to July 2017](https://preview.redd.it/pk6k8lqljbc71.png?width=1558&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=82e53724ca3b512e7a51e5b984e4ac39ef9c08a4)

[Exact same price action between December 2017 to July 2021](https://preview.redd.it/9s8y9f3sjbc71.png?width=1559&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e5f7482966ee5736b427ac45e3982ca3d5961263)

When Steve Wozniak called Bitcoin a mathematical miracle, he wasn't kidding. Whatever makes the price action rhyme this way between halving cycles can be analyzed by humans similar to the patterns in nature but never fully understood.

It once again begs the question if Mathematics was invented or discovered.

I was already super excited 3 years ago to observe whether the same pattern would play out again. To see it play out exactly the same way is nothing short of spine-chilling.

I'm wound up in a tremulous horripilation of incredulity!

You can check out the two pinned posts on the profile.

In February 2018, when everyone was panicking, I pointed out that we would go back to 19k and beyond in the next cycle.

Back then, I hadn't yet analyzed the price action this closely but I knew the cycles.

Then in December last year, I called for $100k before the end of 2021 which I still stand by.

In my personal opinion, it's very likely that 29k is the bottom for this correction phase.

But you should of course DYOR.","Bitcoin price July 2013 - $66, December 2013 - $1163. July 2017 - $1830, December 2017 - $19700. This is standard bull cycle consolidation (Fibonacci Analysis)",1626766178

CryptoCurrency,"Hello all,

I have done extensive research and spent hours studying charts and diagrams, comparing the last few months to previous Crypto cycles. The conclusion?

*The bull market has only just started.*

  
Reason 1:

This chart (Figure 1) indicates we still have a long way to go before we reach the peak of the bull.

&amp;#x200B;

[Figure 1. Upwards movement of crypto over time = profits](https://preview.redd.it/rmiguhcw7bc71.png?width=220&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dd1e3dc029d62543283f1ea8fecfe28e200de974)

&amp;#x200B;

How can you argue with this clear indication of upward momentum? This is a strong market indicator that the market is healthy.

&amp;#x200B;

Reason 2: 

There are huge profits still to be made. The average investor can expect to see this (Figure 2) in their wallets by the end of the week....

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

If you don't like money, sell now. I guarantee anyone who holds will receive MONEY if they hold for the next couple of days.

CryptoCurrency,"48H ago I had this wonderful idea that I should move my investment from cEX to dEX, since binance may start closing withdrawals, or it may get hacked, etc. I just wanted my funds with me so I proceeded to exchange my USDT to DAI. 

I started withdrawing the DAI in the BSC network since the fees were minimal (Mistake #1)

Now I wanted the DAI to be totally free from Binance's control so I thought I would exchange the DAI (BSC) to DAI (ERC20) using Omni chain.

At the time of exchange the transaction cost was around a few bucks so I thought why not, Binance's own BSC to ERC costs 15 Dai to exchange 50 Dai but Omni costs peanuts compared to that.

Well guess what guys, after converting my (BSC) DAI to Binance Pegged DAI, I can't claim it back cuz Gwei jumped from 8 to 40 and still remains in that range. 

I have increased my gwei count to 9.8 but it's still in pending because the Gwei has barely dropped.

Now you would think I would stop there, but no, I bought some Uniswap and Sushi Swap for staking, transfered again via BSC network (Mistake #2) 

Created a new liquidity pool in Sushi swop for USDC/Sushi which costs 5$, and added my remaining Sushi/Uniswap to an already existing pool. 

Yet again, I'm fucked again cuz I can't farm my LP tokens that I got for those shares on Sushi Swap BSC network. 

Now here's the third installment to really hit me in the balls, I transfered 20$ to my Wazrix account via Binance - Wazrix transfer feature. I had done so in the past for Arbitrage expirments and I thought I would do it again.

Well guess what! Indian Enforcement Directorate put a ""show cause notice"" 2H before my transfer for Wazrix because they let people transfer between Binance and Wazrix without KYC, which is now a big No No for India's ED.

So I can't transfer it back to my Binance account untill I my KYC is approved on Wazrix, but you would think my luck would start to pickup, but no I spent an hour chatting with the Wazrix staff about why my KYC which I applied for on May 8Th hasn't been approved yet. 

After a few hours I get an email saying my kyc is rejected because the images were not clear, any attempt to reupload the image results in a ""National ID already taken"" error.

You see that last entry? That was purchased today. Right at the current dip. Brave has done this before. This is why BAT token generally dumps less in comparison to other tokens. And buying the dips actually profits Brave Inc because they get more tokens which have the potential to go up significantly higher in the future.  


When advertisers pay Brave Inc, they pay in USD. Brave Inc uses that to buy BAT tokens. So, the lower the price of BAT the more BAT brave can buy. The more they buy, the more they get as the 30% cut. Also, brave ads users like me also benefit as we also receive more BAT tokens.

Firstly the 21 Weekly EMA has become resistance; from previous support 

This means any attempt to go higher is blocked by it. Historically a 1st attempt is rejected and we get a lower low then an upswing past it. So it will act as the roof from now on. It is currently at $45,000.00

Resistance at the 50 RSI

CryptoCurrency,"The vision:  A coin backed by a network of homes that people actually live in. After all, few things could be as tangible or as real as the home you live in. And real estate is one of the most stable asset classes, at the same time also keeping pace with inflation unlike fiat pegged stablecoins. So while this coin may not be stable in terms of its peg to fiat, it is more stable in terms of preserving purchasing power. Just as importantly, it provides an alternative to fiat or gold.

&amp;#x200B;

The hope is that pegging it to real estate would mean that it keeps up with inflation and with lower volatility, could make it suitable for daily purchases and transactions. It might also lower the cost of borrowing which could make Defi more competitive with Cefi. Eg, with interest rates around 10% who would take out a home loan in crypto when fiat interest rates are 1-3%? Or just reduce the collateral needed.

&amp;#x200B;

A brief overview of how it would work is that the money raised for this coin would go towards a co-investment in people‚Äôs homes. The co-investment will be paid back when the homeowner sells their house or after a predetermined number of years eg 30 years. The money can then be used to co-invest in another home.

&amp;#x200B;

If you're wondering where the homes that back this coin would come from, here's where the idealistic part comes in.

The first group is renters, so many people are renting when they hope to own their own homes, instead of paying a landlord why not build up your home equity and wealth instead? The co-investment could fast forward their homeownership dreams by years by coming up with the down payment and other upfront costs.

The second group faces systemic discrimination such as women, racial and sexual minorities or even just singles who don‚Äôt benefit as much from governments‚Äô family planning policies and subsidies. They typically take a long time to save up for a down payment if ever, a co-investment can be very empowering by making up for the shortfalls in the system immediately.

The third group is those who already have a home and may still be paying off their mortgage and want to tap into their home‚Äôs equity. Some may have run into financial difficulties, some want to cash out a portion of their homes. Instead of taking a home equity loan which results in more debt that you have to pay interest on, a co-investment gives a debt-free way to tap into their home equity.

I understand DeFi and crypto have given so many people the opportunity to generate wealth and do better for themselves. Every time I see a news headline about what makes crypto the future I see DeFi being the first thing listed but after spending several months in the space, I have become beyond skeptical.

DeFi is basically a glorified casino. It‚Äôs riddled with scams, and most of the projects that end up being legit almost certainly die spectacular deaths within a week or a month of listing. Legitimate projects that have some sort of use case often don‚Äôt amount to much and the ones that really do the numbers are dog or other meme themed. It‚Äôs a total shit show and I feel as though the world media is yet to wake up to this. What happens when they do?

CryptoCurrency,"So, we're down well over 50%, more so if you're in alts. It's tough right now. Tougher still if you bought in the last couple of months on a ""correction"", which proved to continue to correct further. 

Yet, it's good to remember that fundamentally, nothing has really changed since May. Miners leaving China, USDT issues, a bearish TA pattern, some billionaire's Tweets... none of those things are really *fundamental* to the concept of cryptocurrencies and the wider benefits of blockchain technology. We're dealing with a nascent asset class, one with considerable and still untapped potential. The technology behind the funky-looking icons is amazing. There's a lot of crap out there, yes, but there's also some amazing projects with current and future utility.

I'm addition, let's not forget that only a few months ago, we were at ATHs. Sentiment flipped in a very short space of time, cumulating to where we are now. We could still go lower. But remember that sentiment can also flip the other way too. Charts can only tell you so much - all of it historical - so don't just put all your faith in lines on a chart. Remember that sentiment is fluid and it can - will - change. It can also change very quickly, with little rhyme or reason. So as we're trending into more red candles below $30K BTC, remember that the narrative is not fixed.

Crypto is a fast-paced market. You can be down -20% in a day and up 20% the next. It's volatile. It's why it's very risky, but can also be very profitable.

So I say be patient. View your crypto assets as investments - as opposed to short-term bets or punts - and take the long-view. This asset class has been declared dead before and will be again. But my money's on the positive and I highly doubt May's prices represent the pinnacle forever more.

CryptoCurrency,"The bull run didn't end in May. 

And no, we *didn't* start going down because of Elon or China FUD.

The truth is, the bears took control in February.  When BTC was at $47K.

Now, I know 2021 brought a lot of new people to Crypto. A lot of you guys don't know anything about technical analysis, so I'll break it down for you. There's an indicator traders like to use called the RSI or Relative Strength Index, which is used to track price momentum.

The crucial bit of information is that the RSI for BTC was overbought in February and started to decline each month, despite the price continuing to rise. This is called bearish divergence, which occurs when prices goes up but our oscillator prints a lower high. 

Smart money knows about this, because that's what makes them smart. That's why when BTC went from $47K, to $57K and higher, they were taking profits on the way up. Smart money moved their profits into stable coin at the top. If they were really smart, they shorted down to $30K as well.

The point is, that's how whales play the game. That's how they can buy the dip. It's why they have capital to deploy at $28K and below. Crypto is not broken. We don't need to come up theories like S2F or lengthening cycles. The warning signs were there in February. Anyone who doesn't understand that and is complaining how we didn't go to $200,000 this year was simply asking to get rekt. 

You won't hear this on YouTube or Twitter. Looking at most of the shitposts on this sub, I expect this analysis will get buried. I'm interested to see how well a genuinely informative post does. Let's see. Maybe this helps someone be smarter next time.

But not even an intellectually-challenged person who had once revived a dying, intellectually-challenged chad, was prepared for what Poop Coin had in store today.

They looked at each other with sad feelings, like two beautiful, better bat killing at a very slow apocalypse, which had regaton music playing in the background and two stupid uncles stepping to the beat.

BTC regarded Poop Coin's poop ass and weird nose. ""I don't have the funds ..."" he lied.

Ergo has been a coin that is talked here every once in a while, but here's some basic information on ergo.


*History*


Ergo. Was devolped back in 2017 with a proof of work status. It never went over its ATH from late 2017, hitting around $22. Now it sits at $4 about $18 in may.

Ergo had no premine but the first couple years of ergo's existence was pretty lucrative. Although miners did take a cut of the rewards of mined ergo. When mining, and the devs made a lot of ergo off of it.

*Technology* 


The coin's proof of work algorithm doesn't allow Asics to be profitable, which in theory was to decentralize the supply since asics have a ton of power to mine specific coins. Ergo used to not allow pools to mine from, but removed that rule a while ago. When mining it's suggested that you mine with a gpu of 5gigs of vram for profitability. 

Fees were implemented with a standard deviation. High demand = high cost. Low demand = low cost.

The cap is 97 mill for ergo.. The current supply is 32~ mill. That's still a lot more to mine although rewards are going down by each halving. Ergo has a pretty bad scaling issue though being accused of higher fees.

ergo does have NFT inclusion. 

The top 100 people own 20%~ of the supply. Which isn't the best but is optimal for a smaller Coin.

Ergo works with smart Contracts! And had worked on building more powerful smart contracts, called multi stage contracts, oracles include information that move within the blockchains.

*What else*

Ergo, other than mining, has a good DeFi. It allows Dapps to be built on ergo. The creator of ADA had talked to ergo devs previously and ADA had tested on ergo's chain before, mainly about smart contracts


TLDR: Ergo after Ethereum will have a strong use case to mine. It doesn't have the best use case other than a good alt coin to mine *right now*. it has foundations set for a brighter future. Ergo started at the last bull run but never reached its ATH. Ergo has about 60%~ of its supply left to mine, includes a script to allow NFT's, but i haven't seen it being used much. The top 100 people hodling ergo own a nice 20% of the supply, which isn't good but not bad. Many complaints ergo has had in the past was scaling it to a larger market, although it looks like in the future they may solve many scaling issues.","Explaining ERGO; The coin to mine after Ethereum, or something more?",1626751989

*Wall of Text Warning*

As we enter a potential Bear Market or Crab Market, it's becoming increasingly lucrative to Yeild Farm. Unfortunately, I don't think many people truly understand it. How it works, what there is to gain and also, most importantly the risks. 

Over the last half a year I have personally delved deep into DeFi and want to explain in my own words a little explaination of how the Crypto wild west really works. 

**WHAT IS LIQUIDITY PROVISION?**

A decentralised exchanged works by creating a pool containing two assets. Let's say on the Binance Smart Chain, PancakeSwap want to offer swaps between BNB and BUSD. A pool will contain a ratio of these two assets and in order to take out one, you must deposit the other. Many mechanisms essentially try to keep the value in the pool the same through all these swaps, but the ratio of the different assets might change.

This is decentralised because it removes the need for order books. Price is indicated by the current ratio of Crypto Assets in the pool, and since no-one needs to match a buyer with a seller and oversee the transaction like traditional order books do. The only interaction the user has is with a pool, which is implemented with a smart contract thus immutable and verifiable on the blockchain.

Unfortunately for this to work we need liquidity. This is where liquidity providers come in, they deposit their assets into the pool making sure both assets are of equal value. This increases the Total Value Locked into the pool and allows swaps to happen.

LPs earn a portion of all trading fees on the pool, in this instance PancakeSwap charges 0.25% as a trading fee on every swap. 0.17% goes to the LPs split between them with regards to how much liquidity they've provided.

https://imgur.com/a/zpby3I7

On our BUSD-BNB pair it took 144,000 USD of fees in one day!

**WHAT'S THE RISK?**

This sounds too good to be true. And many think it is. In reality it's a little muddier than that.

Impermenent loss is something that's thrown around a lot as a boogeyman. A reason to avoid Yeild Farming, and understandably so, it's a difficult concept to understand. However, hopefully we can go back to our example to explain how it works.

Esentially, when you provide liquidity you are allowing others to use your liquidity to swap between the two tokens you provide. You can't swap more tokens than exist in a pool, because they don't exist for you to swap between. When a token is in demand to be bought or dumped people are likely to want to swap away from one token and into another.

Say the price of BNB sharply decreases. Most weak hands are going to sell. Swapping in our pool to BUSD. However, as a liquidity provider we know we hold both assets, and giving up our BUSD to swappers means we're left with their BNB. If we withdraw our tokens now, we're going to end up with an imbalanced ratio to what we put in. Less BUSD and more BNB. 

However BNB isn't worth as much as when we bought it! If we now go to swap ours, we have more of it sure but it's worth less so we might *actually* be worse off than if we just held our BNB.

This works the other way too. If BNB sharply rises then BUSD sellers are going to buy BNB leaving us with less of the now more valuable token and more BUSD in return.

This is complicated to get your head around so give it another read if you need to.

The good news is twofold though.

* A. Impermenent loss is easy to mitigate if you're aware of what's happening in the crypto world.

* B. It only become permenent loss if you withdraw. The price of BNB might return to where you bought it, meaning you'll be able to withdraw roughly the amount you put in. 

It's also important to note Stable Pairs don't suffer from IL at all, and two volatile pairs will be far more risky as you must keep in mind two tokens could move in different directions.

**WHY WOULD I RISK IT?**

Well, luckily there's a third piece of good news. It's where Yeild Farming comes in.

DeXs want to incetivise LP. So, they allow you to deposit LP Receipts in the form of other tokens into a farm. These farms offer some insane APYs. How?

Most of them provide their results in the DeX's native token. For example PCS offers CAKE rewards for farming and back when Uniswap did their farms they offered UNI. LPs are betting that a native token is going to hold and increase in value, and of course high APYs can be offered since the protocol is minting or distributing pre-minted tokens at a set emission rate.

There is a potential worry for these native token to not be worth anything, or inflate massively in value, but with more and more usecases such as PancakeSwap profiles and Uni Governance the prices are most likely here to stay. 

Most farming reward will offset any IL, and chances are if you mitigate IL (Something I hope to explain more in a future post depending on demand) then you'll come out making some serious money.

The great thing is, with Crab Markets, moving to the side is exactly what LPs want.

**HOW DO I DO ALL THIS?**

I'm quickly going to show you how easy this is:

Here I am on ViperSwap. A UniSwap clone on the Harmony ONE network. I'm on testnet so I can work with a lot of ONE.

[ViperSwap Interface](https://imgur.com/a/Mfi6AB8)

First I need two tokens of equal value which I want to target.

[1BUSD-VIPER is looking *nice*](https://imgur.com/a/adsKNOt)

The interface might be a little different on different networks but by going to the pool tab I can provide liquidity. 

[Adding my tokens](https://imgur.com/a/LXTEtL3)

As you can see by adding 2 BUSD which = 0.9 VIPER, i'll now have contributed 5% of the pool. I have to approve both tokens, but on Harmony this is a very very small gas fee.

[Success!](https://imgur.com/a/lk9fsDB)

My liquidity has been added, and now I have some LP tokens to prove my liquidity exists. Now to go stake them.

[Depositing my LP Tokens](https://imgur.com/a/4eSOcxc)

I'm now earning passive income

[This testnet pool is ticking up about 0.5 VIPER per block mined](https://imgur.com/a/dLLFEAn)

There's a few caveats here. For example while ViperSwap is very cheap, it locks earnt VIPER in order to prevent dumping of the coins. PCS and all the rest DO NOT DO THIS.

Of course you'll have to do your own research into pairs, and platforms at the moment. There's also Yeild Aggregating with a platform like Beefy. Let me know if I can do any more of these guides. And of course, any questions please ask!",Yeild Farming 101,1626749477

CryptoCurrency,"The vision: A coin backed by a network of homes that people actually live in. After all, few things could be as tangible or as real as the home you live in. And real estate is one of the most stable asset classes, at the same time avoiding a peg to any one fiat.

&amp;#x200B;

The hope is that pegging it to real estate would mean it keeps up with inflation and with lower volatility could make it suitable for daily purchases and transactions. It might also lower the cost of borrowing which could make Defi more competitive with Cefi. For example, with interest rates around 10% who would take out a home loan in crypto when fiat interest rates are 1-3%?

&amp;#x200B;

A brief overview of how it would work is that the money raised for this stablecoin would go towards a co-investment in people‚Äôs homes. The co-investment will be paid off when the homeowner sells their house or after a predetermined number of years eg 30 years. The money that comes in can then be used to co-invest in another home.

&amp;#x200B;

If you're wondering where the homes that back this coin would come from, here's where the idealistic part comes in:

The first group is renters. So many people are renting when they hope to own their own homes, instead of paying a landlord why not build up your home equity and wealth instead? The co-investment could fast forward their homeownership dreams by years by coming up with the down payment and other upfront costs.

Yet another group faces systemic discrimination such as women, racial and sexual minorities or even just singles who don‚Äôt benefit as much from governments‚Äô family planning policies and subsidies. They typically take a long time to save up for a down payment if ever, a co-investment can be very empowering by making up for the shortfalls in the system immediately.

The third group is those who already have a home and may still be paying off their mortgage and want to tap into their home‚Äôs equity. Some may have run into some financial difficulties, some want to cash out a portion of their homes. Instead of taking a home equity loan which results in more debt that you have to pay interest on, a co-investment gives a debt-free way to tap into their home equity.

&amp;#x200B;

I will add that I have searched the internet and I can find numerous calculations online but they never add up or make sense to me. Mainly bc none of them focus on showing how to add to a current position to see where it's effect on liquidation price.


Here it goes:

I started trading USDT backed perpetual futures on leverage on KuCoin

I was of course confident the price wouldn't drop enough to liquidate my 5x leverage position.

As the price kept creeping lower I kept buying more to prevent liquidation, and kept digging a deeper and deeper hole. 

I want to know if there is a simple calculation to figure out my what my liquidation price would be if I buy X number of shares at Y price to my current position.

I don't even know what information is necessary for this calcualtion, so will list everything I see.


Currently:

Shares: 35,000
Entry Price: $0.7802
Liquidation Price: $0.5047
Margin: $2040
Realized PNL: -$201.62
Unrealized PNL: -$8322
Mark Price: $0.5426
Current leverage: 13.56x


So. Last time the market dropped and the price plummeted, I started buying more shares at the lowest point possible, right above my liquidation price and therefore moving my liquidation price down slightly. But as my stack grows it is of course taking more funds to do so. 

Now as the price is dropping again I have buy orders in, with no leverage, right above the current liquidation price as well as predicted next liquidation prices as well. Is this the best strategy?

I do have ""Auto-deposit margin"" on, but I don't trust it, plus if I am buying incrementally on the way down I feel like mathematically I should be able to extend my liquidation price even lower than just one big purchase right before the current liquidation price. Is that true?

Also, I currently have an extra $7k in the account to prevent liquidation. 

I basically want to figure out whether or not I should move more funds into the account just in case.

CryptoCurrency,"Hi, all of you 3.2m people from this sub. Only wanted to say I started with darknet, so I discover Btc, then crypto, and then crypto philosophy and revolution and f\*\*\* the banks. I was alone for 5 years, my friends bored about me speaking about that s\*\*\*\*, I was the crazy anarchist squatter guy. I failed and failed and failed, you know, it was difficult a few years ago to find good info. Had to learn by myself, had to discover on my own what was a scam. Had to discover I was a gambler and not a ""trader"", neither a Hodler. And I learned a bit.

&amp;#x200B;

Then only 5 months ago I discovered reddit, I discovered you people, I discovered I was not alone, I discovered the revolution was not going to start, but yet started, and not by a few ones, but by a huge and friendly and lovely community.

&amp;#x200B;

And I was happy, and I learned(learnt?) a lot, and I laugh a lot (discovered crypto memes that no one of my friends understood but I loved), said to my girlfriend look, finally found people like me, finally you're free of listen to me speaking about crypto 30 hours a day.

&amp;#x200B;

And finally I stopped gambling. I was here reading, laughing, learning and investing. I started to make some money. My friends and girlfriend saw maybe crypto was true and not only ""magic internet money"" used to buy drugs from \*\*\*\*\*\* and a kind of money you'll never touch or see cause it doesn't exist.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I can handle this shit and in two months I'm going to reach my dream, work from my pc, live wherever I want (aiming thailand, laos or around there) and fight for crypto and fight against banks, governments and their dogs (ACAB!).

CryptoCurrency,"I‚Äôve posted my researching list on various comments and people seem to find it helpful so I thought I would take the time to go more in depth in the hopes people find it helpful. 

It can be daunting especially for newer investors to know exactly what to possibly research for new investments. This won‚Äôt include any TA or FA such as on chain metrics, rather proper researching into a project. 

Beyond checking whether a project is legitimate, you need to determine it‚Äôs possible future growth potential and where it fits within the crypto space. So here‚Äôs a detailed criteria of how I conduct research into projects and what I look for. 

1. Check both CoinGecko ( https://www.coingecko.com/en ) and CoinMarketCap (https://coinmarketcap.com) - these are both available in app form too. 

Both of these are data aggregators that essentially summarise important data such as prices, market cap overview, trading volume etc. What do I specifically look for in this first section? 

- Rank: I personally have a quick look at rank just to see where it‚Äôs at in relation to competitors. 
- Market cap: this gives an indication of possible future growth compared to competitors and the market in general 
- Total Supply: this can help determine the fully diluted valuation (total supply x current price) 
- Trading volume: this can help determine the liquidity of the asset. A project that has very little trading volume can lead to price manipulation and dramatic price movements by whales. 
- Exchanges: it‚Äôs important to see where the project is listed, this can help determine its exposure to investments and whether it‚Äôs in any reputable exchanges. 

Why do I use both? Simply this allows me to compare for differences and similarities. Furthermore, one may have more information such as a summary about the project. 

2. Look at Messari (https://messari.io) for profile information about the project

What is Messari? It‚Äôs essentially provides data and intelligence about crypto assets. It‚Äôs an absolute golden researching tool and resource. 

What do I look for? 

- there are options to look at the metrics, detailed overview etc. however what I‚Äôm interested in is the profile tab. This has a detailed history about the project, and also has information about regulation, governance of the project, token economics etc. 
- Also a tip for future potential findings for new projects is to look at what large funds are doing with their investments. For example you can view Coinbase Venture portfolio (https://messari.io/screener/coinbase-ventures-portfolio-34D634C4) 

3. Binance Research (https://research.binance.com) now this will be applicable if the project is a BEP-2/BEP-20 token, but this site can give some further information that could be valuable that you may have not collected so far at this stage. Here‚Äôs an example: https://research.binance.com/en/projects/bnb

4. YouTube education: by this stage you should have an ideal understand of the project and it‚Äôs background. However, you may not necessarily understand the technicals behind the project. If it‚Äôs a defi related project you may be lucky as this channel has a lot of detailed defi videos: https://youtube.com/c/Finematics. You can also try this channel that has short straight to the point explanations about hundreds of projects: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFQirr7pBWb520mjyY0wdiWDyS5BYw3MW 

5. Website: it‚Äôs important to look at the projects website. How the content is presented is important because you‚Äôll be hoping it looks professional and not just having buzz words like ‚Äúyou‚Äôll get x% amount of returns that the majority of scam projects will have. 

What am I looking for? 

- roadmap: it‚Äôs important to understand the future potential of a project. What updates is it planning to implement etc. 
- White paper: in my opinion a white paper is a must for any project because it‚Äôs supposed to display the academic layout of what the project is and the technology behind it. The more academic the paper is, the better. 
- Team: who are the founders and team members? Have they been involved in other projects? Have they got social media that you can check? Are they anonymous? (Now this can be a personal preference because some projects have anonymous creators and are legitimate, even Bitcoin in this case but many scam projects will also use anonymity to give an appearance of decentralisation). 
- Partnerships: what other projects are partnered, chainlink is a perfect example here due to the sheer amount of projects they collaborate with. 
- Blogs: some projects will have a dedicated blog post section on the website that gives important updates and news related to the project 

6. Certik: This organisation essentially audits crypto projects code (https://www.certik.org). The security score is important, but in my opinion it doesn‚Äôt necessarily tell you whether a project is legitimate or not. Why? Because the audit isn‚Äôt designed to be an investing signal, it is designed for the projects developers as the audit will identify any coding vulnerabilities that could lead to malicious code exploration. However, the report is important in a sense, because you cans examine the findings and look at major security coding flaws. This could be anywhere from common programming mistakes to more serious privilege escalation related flaws where an individual has the ability to pool liquidity for the project. If you have programming or cyber security experience it‚Äôs a lot easier to understand some of the language used within the report. Moreover, You can also examine on the report whether the project has rectified the issue raised in the audit. 

7. Reddit: just like the platform this post is on, Reddit can be a very useful tool to look for a projects Reddit page and whether it‚Äôs active, what the community is like and can also give updates about the project and discussion. 

8. YouTube interviews: it‚Äôs good to see interviews from the founders to see how they present themselves, as well some may also have dedicated channels that give updates about the project. Examples:

Interview and channel: Vitalik Buterin https://youtu.be/tPAh3cgj8gY

Charles Hoskinson https://youtu.be/yd1eg4QopV8

9. Etherscan (https://etherscan.io) or Bscscan (https://bscscan.com): I use this to look at the holders. To determine how it‚Äôs distributed and whether a certain wallet holds a large percentage of the supply which can be damaging to price action. 

10. ICOdrops: this is essentially a database (https://icodrops.com) and can allow you to do some DD on how a project was funded. 

11. Final question: Does this solve something in the crypto space? 

It‚Äôs hard to start up a business, let alone getting technology adoption to occur. Unfortunately many startups and projects do fail (https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/040915/how-many-startups-fail-and-why.asp) and it‚Äôs important to have a final check to make sure you‚Äôre happy about the longevity of that project. You want to be confident that it will still be around in the future and can survive the battlefield of a bear market.

TLDR at bottom

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

As markets continue their second month of dramatic sell offs, many newcomers are getting shaked out of the market by big whales wanting to add to their holdings at the $30k support level. I want to provide some analyses which prove we may be nearing a bottom, barring any sell pressure from US Stock Markets. Also, believers in blockchain technology need to remember that total conviction is necessary to be able to hold through multiple 70% drops. The guy who bought $1,000 at the top of 2013 would be enjoying 3000% gains currently, despite at least half a dozen falls of 50%. Remember these are volatile markets that have not quite matured yet. As governments provide regulatory insights for citizens and governments, volatility may remain high but subdue as more certainty hits the cryptocurrency markets. 

Despite an ugly chart, many on-chain indicators are pointing at further upside, as shown by William Clemente. For one, whale wallets have been getting busy, aggressively buying as we enter the 30-32k levels. As well, about 10% of all coins in existence have been traded between 31-35k, proving this should prove to be good long term support. 

Log chart shows that the 1.618 fibonacci level sits somewhere between 28-32k. This fib level has acted as mic-cycle support for the previous bull runs in 2013 and 2017. Both runs continued upside shortly after reaching these levels. A sustained dip below 28k may invalidate this trend, however. 

Global bitcoin adoption continues to grow exponentially, with new wallet addresses surging following the dip from $65k to 28k. Previous bull runs had resulted in significant drop offs in new users on the network after the big crash. Remember, BTC‚Äôs price is largely a network effect; the more addresses on the network, the higher the price rises with respect to time. Others that experienced network effects include Apple, Amazon, Ethereum, and Facebook. More users equals higher prices. I also expect AAVE to experience network effects as institutional money enters, but I could discuss more about this in a later post. Supply held by entities containing .1-1 BTC reaches new levels every day, proving an accumulation phase is occurring. Previous accumulation phases by wallets of this size occurred just before the 2017 bull run, and the 2021 bull run. *There is a chance we are just getting started* with the 2021 bull run. This is not financial advice, rather a bit of hopium for holders to remember.

The man bought thousands at $10 and as supply started to diminish, the villagers stopped their effort. He further announced that he would now buy at $20. This renewed the efforts of the villagers and they started catching monkeys again.

Soon the supply diminished even further and people started going back to their farms. The offer increased to $25 each and the supply of monkeys became so little that it was an effort to even see a monkey, let alone catch it!

The man now announced that he would buy monkeys at $50! However, since he had to go to the city on some business, his assistant would now buy on behalf of him.

In the absence of the man, the assistant told the villagers; ""Look at all these monkeys in the big cage that the man has collected. I will sell them to you at $35 and when the man returns from the city, you can sell them to him for $50 each.""

The villagers rounded up with all their savings and bought all the monkeys.

CryptoCurrency,"&amp;#x200B;

So research doesn't need to be amazingly in-depth. You don't need a degree in cryptography or need to understand the nuts and bolts of how blockchains work. You don't even need to read or understand the white paper. 

Firstly, if you're thinking about investing in a coin? - go to the coin's website. You can usually tell straight away if you're looking at a shitcoin. 

Stuff to look out for:

The project: What is the coin trying to achieve? what problems is it solving? Is it necessary? does it do anything unique that other coins aren't doing?

The team: Are they visible, do they have a background in cryptography, finance, mathematics, statistics, software engineering etc etc. Have they worked on good projects in the past? have they been involved in any scams before? A quick google of the names is all you need. 

The website: Is it professional and easy to understand? Do they try and blow you away with jargon without giving you the faintest idea of what they actually do? (I'm looking at you ICP). Is it full of spelling mistakes and obviously copy-pasted text and generic waffle?

&amp;#x200B;

So you like the project, like the idea, like the team, and the website looks legit. Now what?

Play devils advocate and look up news articles about the project. Try googling the coin with words like ""scam, ponzi, hacked, vulnerability etc"" see what negative things have been written about the project, try to collect as much criticism as you can. Has the team actually addressed any of these criticisms? Has the coin been updated to address any of its vulnerabilities or potential vulnerabilities? 

Does the coin do what it's supposed to do? Try to find some testimonials from people who've actually used it. For example, if your coin is a storage coin, find people who've actually tried using the service to store their files, what experiences have they had?

Buy a small amount of the coin, set up a wallet, see if it's as fast, cheap, painless as it claims to be. Try to use the service for whatever they say they are for. If it's an exchange token for example -&gt; how easy is the exchange to use? does it have low fees? does it work better than other exchanges that offer similar services? does the exchange offer anything that other exchanges don't?

Have similar projects offered/attempted the same thing and failed in the past? This is a big one, because time and time again you'll have a project fail making the exact same mistakes as other past projects. For example, algorithmic stablecoins, it's really, really, really hard to come up with an algorithm that automatically pegs a currency and is extremely easy to exploit if you get it wrong. Look at what happened with Titan/Iron.

AVOID YouTube/Twitter/Reddit shills and influencers. These people are often paid a lot of money to promote a product and will not offer objective analysis of the coin. 

In depth podcasts/interviews/AMAs with creators of coins can be very useful however, if only to get an idea of what the coin does and how it works from the people behind it. 

Lastly, is the coin being worked on, developed and upgraded? Look the coin up on Cryptomiso, see how many github contributors/commits it has next to it.

CryptoCurrency,"I'd like to start with a disclaimer. This is completely based on my perspective, therefore don't take this as financial advice. 

&amp;#x200B;

As u may know we're currently in a 'big crypto dump' that unfortunately causes a lot of people to panick and consequently sell. These people are most likely new to the market or investing in general. As a first recommendation I'd suggest these people to look at the whole graph, instead of putting an interval of 1 minute. U should then realize pretty quickly that this 'big crypto dump' is completely common as the market tries to stabilize. 

&amp;#x200B;

Why do I think right now is the perfect time to invest? Well, gut feelings innit. No, just joking. Cryptocurrency in general became a very promising concept and will for sure play a big part in our lives in the upcoming future. If u compare this market to any market like gold, stock market or even real estate, u will see that cryptocurrency's market cap is not even close to theirs. What does this mean? Well, it means that this particular market is very refreshing and there's still a LOT of money to be made.

&amp;#x200B;

Another point I'd like to make is cryptocurrency's utility. If u have followed some of the altcoin's progress, like Doge, u should see where I'm getting at. Dogecoin started as a joke and over time it got serious up to a point where u can buy Teslas and shop on Amazon in the future. Even at this point u can do many transactions with this coin and therefore its utility increases. Aside from Dogecoin, the same principle goes with Bitcoin and Ethereum.

&amp;#x200B;

To get back to graphs and interval, try it. This has changed my perspective a lot when it comes to investments in this market. People have been bad mouthing and lost hope since back in 2013 and guess what, all the naysayers were wrong.

And last but not least, decentralization in 2024.

CryptoCurrency,"Disclosure: I own several POS projects that pay APY.

Most all of the serious crypto projects today are all inflationary (ETH may soon become an exception but not currently).  This inflation is nearly always deterministic and controlled (not the same as government fiat inflation).  

Inflation always transfers some of the value of the existing coins to the newly minted coins.  

POW (BTC) value transfer from hodlers to miners as all new coins are paid to block producers.

POS where coins must be staked (Cosmos, Tezos)  these coins only pay interest if the hodler takes extra steps to stake - in this case there is a value transfer from those who don't stake to those who do.  The higher interest rate is meaningful and affects the rate of value transfer.  The relative value of the interest payments are inversely proportional to the number of coins staked (at 100% participation no one is gaining value by staking - they are managing not to lose any value by staking so it is still an optimal decision).

POS where everyone is paid interest (ALGO).  Everyone is paid ~6%  no value transfer occurs in this scenario, while their may be a legitimate reason to do it (in ALGOs case they are trying to distribute the circulating coins fairly) the 6% you are paid results in a slight decrease in the value of each coin directly offset by the value of new coins received.",The APY comparison between POS coins doesn't matter.,1626742084

CryptoCurrency," My friend and I both started buying cryptos after the bullrun in May, although at the time I didn't know he joined this world too. He is probably the prime example of what happens when you learn about cryptos on [r/CryptoMoonShots](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoonShots/) : he had no prior experience in cryptos and was somehow convinced to invest in a token on the Binance Smart Chain (yeah I know...); he also joined the Telegram group associated with the coin and became part of their ''army'' (he even changed his pfp to the logo of the coin).

He told me about his investment when we met a few weeks later, he tried to convince me to invest in it too but at the time I was still a newbie and I was afraid of buying anything that wasn't a very well established coin, I also don't trust anyone when my money is on the line. Even tho I was a newbie a could smell bullshit from a mile away and I told him that I didn't think this token was a legit project. He ignored me.

A couple of days later I tried again: I messaged him and told him that the coin was definitly a scam; I told him how when researching this coin all I could find was only a bunch of posts on [r/CryptoMoonShots](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoonShots/) and in some comments even the members of the sub were calling it a scam. I did also take a look at their website and the whitepaper is literally a pdf with 12 basic slides. He was a bit worried but still didn't sell.

Literally the next day he texted me back showing me that the price of the coin increased by 1000%, I told him to sell, he ignored me again because the members of the telegram group told him that the value was going to increase further; literally 30 minutes later the price was back to what it was before the pump. Anyone would have understood that if the price pumps and dumps so quickly it means that the price is heavily manipulated; he instead trusted even more the token and I ended up looking like an asshole. To this day he still holds the coin. He's definitly going to get fucked once the rugpull takes place.

I'm going to wrap this up because I don't wanna type a novel. The moral of the story is that the source from which someone learns about cryptocurrencies is probably the most important and crucial step for new investors. If someone you know is dipping their toes in the crypto world, it is extremly important that they are given some sort of guidance, too many people still think that crypto is a get-rich-quick scheme and fall prey of greed and scam-coins. I know that many on this sub say that the easiest thing to do is just not to talk with them about crypto because you could ruin a friendship but in my humble opinion, if your friend ends up hating you because of a shitcoin, he wasn't a real friend. The experience of the scam will also probably make them abbandon the crypto world forever and they will end up missing real opportunities.

CryptoCurrency,"Hello, I'm /u/industriousness, and welcome to my first in a series of threads aimed at the average /r/CryptoCurrency user with the intention of changing their perception in relation to Reddit Moons and their potential.

By now we are all aware of the fact that posting in different ways, and receiving upvotes, can result in a user on this subreddit being awarded moons on a monthly basis. These monthly awards are subject to votes that refine the distribution process each month, and in so doing help to legitimise Reddit Moons as a cryptocurrency by lowering the supply of Moons produced each month. 

Reddit Moons are seen as a curio; a strange oddity of this subreddit. The fact that arguably the largest crypto community on the internet has its own cryptocurrency is not something that, to my knowledge, people have given a lot of deference or thought to, apart from the usually vague posts about ""waiting until Moons hit the mainnet"" (which is, of course, an extremely acceptable and sensible position to take). 

Perhaps part of the reason for this is 1) a lack of use cases for Reddit Moons, 2) infrequent communication to the users of this subreddit as to what the end ambition of Reddit Moons is supposed to be, 3) Reddit Moons not as of yet being available on ""mainnet"" exchanges such as Coinbase or Kraken and 4) a scepticism of the price of Reddit Moons themselves. These are all perfectly reservations to have in terms of Reddit Moons.

I think there needs to be a new conversation about Reddit Moons, like when Gallileo introduced to the concept of Copernican Heliocentricism. I think we need to start talking not just about price predictions (because believe you me, the price of Reddit Moons is destined to increase from here on out) but exit strategies.

The problem is the safety of your funds.

If I have $100k in cash in the bank or stocks I feel 100% safe that I'm never going to lose that money.

If somehow my bank account is compromised/hacked, I ring up the bank and within a couple of days the money is back in my account. This has happened to many people I know. In fact the bank has even refunded me when I've bought airline tickets and the airline went bankrupt. I'm secure in the knowledge that my money is safe.

Stocks, even more so - they are actually in my name - so I don't have any worry they'll be stolen.

Crypto exchanges and wallets on the other hand - you're on your own. No crypto exchange is going to refund you if your account is compromised and your funds are stolen. Then there is the risk of the exchange itself getting hacked or going insolvent. 

So then you have to go the route of a cold wallet. But then you're left with the dilemma of where to store the seed phrase. Leaving it at home somewhere risks it getting destroyed or stolen, the equivelent to having $100k lying around. Putting it in ledger or a password protected file with a backup somewhere is good, but if you forget the password you're screwed, and again you could have it stolen or hacked, again with the bank you lose the password it's no big deal - just prove your ID to the bank and you have access to your funds again. 

So you're left with having to come up with a convoluted solution to protect your funds - have half the seed phrase at a safe deposit box at the bank, half at another bank, have a backup on a disused laptop somewhere that isnt connected to the internet etc etc..

CryptoCurrency,"NFTs offer a high level of interoperability and act as representations of non-traditional assets. 

This means that NFTs can be used in many areas. This includes video games, digital identity, licensing, certificates, or fine arts. These tokens can and even allow for fractional ownership of objects.

This is precisely where DeFi comes into play.

In all of the fields they are applied to, NFTs serve to represent some sort of value. The administration of these values can be done completely in the blockchain via smart contracts. This perfectly fits the definition of a DeFi project: a financial tool operating along the blockchain.

**Present DeFi NFT offerings:**

 Existing developments in this area are already diverse.

For example, there are DeFi projects that describe themselves as a decentralized exchange for NFTs. One of the best known in this area is [**Drops**](https://drops.co). It is a new protocol that‚Äôs designed to leverage NFTs as collateral for loans. Designed with the future of financial NFTs in mind, Drops aims to optimize the utility of NFT assets to minimize their opportunity cost and maximize the returns of holding them. 

Another example of the combination of NFTs and DeFi is [**Aavegotchi**](https://aavegotchi.com/), which is a completely decentralized collection game.

Furthermore, [**Tinlake**](https://tinlake.centrifuge.io/) combines NFTs and Defi by offering a service that forms a bridge between real-world assets and DeFi. Its goal is to access bankless liquidity.

[**NFTfi**](https://nftfi.com/) is an additional player that stands out in this field. They offer a platform on which owners can lend their NFTs to other users.

These companies are already innovative and diverse. But, these are just a few of the many potential applications of these technologies. As described, the possibilities for combining DeFi and NFTs are far from exhausted.

An exciting future endeavor would be using DeFi and NFTs in in-game worlds or even for the administration of real assets such as land and houses.

**Summary:**

NFTs describe unique cryptographic tokens which are considered valuable because of their security and scarcity. In combination with decentralized financial products, unique financial services can be created using these tokens.

Potential use cases for this type of technological innovation include investments, liquidity mining, or in-game currencies. There are truly unlimited ideas for combining NFTs and DeFi-it remains to be seen which interesting projects will appear soon.",DeFi is rocket fuel for NFTs,1626738321

All models are wrong, but some are more useful than others.  In this post I'll be using some technical analysis, on chain metrics, and upcoming events to make speculation about what I think the market is more likely to do (go up) and some info about the potential for downside.  Before I get started on this, here's a TLDR for those who CBA to read walls of text.

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR:** Crypto market as a whole is still largely a slave to bitcoin price action.  Bitcoin is forming a descending wedge pattern on low volume (reversal signal) and network hash rate is closely modeling the shape of the late 2018-&gt;mid 2019 bull action.  On chain metrics also indicate that those with large amounts of bitcoin are largely accumulating at current prices.  Ethereum London Hard Fork maybe also act as a catalyst for price increase.  On the flip side, the 2021 cycle and crash in may has exhibited several of the same indicators we have seen post other cycle tops, and we could realistically have finished this bull run and be in the long term bear market.  In addition, several impending market crash indicators for the US stock market are appearing and a stock market crash may lead to a crypto market crash similar to March 2020.  Smooth brain say price either go up, down, or sideways.

&amp;#x200B;

**1. Bitcoin as the market driver**

Since the inception of cryptocurrency, bitcoin has been the dominator of market sentiment.  Long term trends of nearly every cryptocurrency have followed the same trend and cyclical price action based on bitcoin's halvening events.  Below are graphs of the total market cap of the entire crypto market and bitcoin's price for the past year.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/godlr1mio8c71.png?width=800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=37a451671e1edb2300f46d8dea93e54171ae7482

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6hctljzzo8c71.png?width=804&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bbf8b160238adda268448efba6f5b1c4a212bba8

Pretty easy to spot that these graphs are strikingly similar and come to the conclusion that the crypto market still is largely just following whatever bitcoin does.  Personally I think within the next decade we will see other projects establish themselves well enough to become decoupled from bitcoin but for the time being analyzing bitcoin remains a solid method of analyzing what the entire market as a whole will do so for the rest of this post I will stick mostly to what's going on with bitcoin under the assumption that the rest of the market will generally follow bitcoin's trends.

&amp;#x200B;

**2. Bitcoin price TA, the falling wedge pattern**

First I'll start by discussing what a falling wedge pattern is, how it forms, and what it means.  A falling wedge pattern occurs when you have contracting price ranges in an overall downward trend.  Essentially you see lower highs and lower lows and the range that the price is staying inside of is getting smaller and smaller.  Another indication of the wedge pattern forming is that volume is also decreasing.

A falling wedge pattern occurring after the general trend has been upward (definitely was the case for bitcoin prior to this correction) is a sign of trend reversal, in this case a correction ending and resuming a bull run.  The more the price contracts during this wedge pattern, the less powerful the downtrend becomes.  Let's zoom in on this.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/anja4op4t8c71.png?width=174&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=70d316936b2adc5982ad40f97bfec920ef62d852

Looking at bitcoin's recent price action, we can see the formation of the falling wedge and the accompanied drop in volume.  My conjecture is that this is a pattern indicating a reversal in the trend and that we see the bull market resume after an extended correction (or short term bear market, whichever works).

Keep in mind, technical analysis is mostly bullshit, especially where crypto is concerned.  There are significant amounts of traders that do trade based on technical indicators though so there is some validity to technical analysis but it is certainly far from a guarantee that what it is indicating will actually happen. 

&amp;#x200B;

**3. Bitcoin network hash rate**

Bitcoin's hash rate is a measure of how much computing power is being applied to the network by miners.  This provides network operation and security with increasing levels as more computing power is applied to the network.  Bitcoin's price does not always follow hash rate, but it can give us an idea of how much interest there is in mining bitcoin and is a good valuation as far as bitcoins ""worth"" in terms of real value applied to the network in the form of computing power which costs money from electricity and equipment.  Here's a graph of hash rate for the past 3 years.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/g2cxbrh6v8c71.png?width=720&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9dfb5022798e622416d67111f0d965fd00a22d2f

Keep in mind that these hash rate values are not exact, but calculated based on how long blocks are taking to solve at current difficulty levels and then average over a short time period to create a trendline.

There are a few key things to take away from this graph.  First off, a drop in the bitcoin price has not always been accompanied by a drop in hash rate.  This point is more obvious when you look at hash rate during the end of the 2017 bull run (not shown here) where hash rate keeps going up even through the crash.  In more recent years however, we have seen a general trend where the network hash rate drops and increases with the bitcoin price.  Looking at the end of the graph it's pretty easy to spot where the middle of May 2021 is and when the Chinese miners had to shut down their operations.

What this caused was the largest difficulty drop on record (and another further difficulty drop the last adjustment).  This means that mining profitability has now skyrocketed relative to where it was in May prior to the crash.  Since then more and more operations (likely in China mostly) have had to shut down and as the network hash rate plummeted, prior to the difficulty adjustment, many miners probably shut down their equipment temporarily while mining was relatively difficult and block times were long.  Let's zoom in to what's currently happening though.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/w1r8ovabx8c71.png?width=720&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c36f337b8a62a9ab8aaa09e9dd05abd59de14c4e

Hash rate bottoms out at the beginning of July, where we had the massive drop in difficulty, and then BAM, hash rate immediately starts to climb back up.  Mining is now profitable again and we see hash rate has been on an uptrend since that huge adjustment.  Likely this is just the 1st wave, a lot of those china based mining operations are looking to move elsewhere and they are going to want to get back online while mining difficulty is still much lower than it was previously.  An increase in hash rate means a more powerful and secure network, and a better valuation for bitcoin.

&amp;#x200B;

**4. Bitcoin accumulation by the whales**

For the sake of brevity and not just copy/pasting, I'm going to link this article which has a pretty solid analysis on the overall trend of various size wallets.

[https://ecoinometrics.substack.com/p/ecoinometrics-on-chain-trends](https://ecoinometrics.substack.com/p/ecoinometrics-on-chain-trends)

The TLDR of this analysis is that wallet addressed that would constitute being whales, largely sold off as bitcoin reach trading high between March-May and have now begun to accumulate again with the price in the low 30k range.  

Typically speaking we think of whales as either institutional investors or individuals with large amounts of wealth.  Nobody in that group is particularly fond of losing money and generally have high amounts of market knowledge or at a minimum have their money being managed by those who do.  With whales accumulating, and events happening like Bank of America offering bitcoin investing to ""select groups"", it's hard to ignore that big money thinks bitcoin has bottomed out and is putting their money behind that hypothesis. 

**5. Ethereum London Hard Fork**

Most of this post has been about bitcoin but Ethereum has definitely become significant enough to warrant it potentially starting to affect the market and dethrone bitcoin as the sole driver.  At time of writing Ethereum is worth 17.1% of the entire crypto market cap (compared to bitcoin's 46.4%).  Ethereum has some exciting news on the horizon so let's take a look.

There are two main features coming in EIP-1559.  The first being a change to how Ethereum gas fees are calculated.  This change should improve the overall user experience of dealing with gas fees and hopefully also make gas fees more consistent in cost.  The second is a gas fee burn mechanic.  Essentially there will be a ""base fee"" and a ""tip"" portion of Ethereum gas fees in transactions.  The ""base fee"" will be burned and the miners will get the ""tip"" portion.  Paying the extra ""tip"" portion can essentially allow someone to pay extra fee in order to make processing the transaction more of a priority for the network.

The token burn mechanic is the one that has the most speculation as far as impact to Ethereum's price goes.  Basing it off the general supply and demand, burning the gas fee instead of giving it to miners would theoretically cause a drop in the supply.  For a given demand level this would then cause an increase in price.  This is obviously not the sole driver of the price of any asset so just like any other single thing, it could cause nothing to happen.

&amp;#x200B;

**6. The potential for downside**

While I would love to live in the dream of ""stocks only go up"" the reality is nobody knows exactly what will happen other than that we will either see it go up, go down, or go sideways.  Let's take a look at what could cause it to go down.

The first theory, is that we have finished the 2021 bull cycle and have entered the typical long term bear market following price run-ups in the halvening cycle.  There are some standard indicators we have seen that have matched up with previous cycle tops.  Bitcoin's price action has definitely trended like a cycle end since the middle of may.  \~50% crash over a few days, followed by a dead cat bounce, then a slow decline.  In addition, the ATH so far in 2021 occurred almost exactly at the same time in the cycle (days post halvening) that the 2013 peak happened.  So timeline wise there is also precedent for the run to have come to an end.  While a double peak is also not unprecedented as the same thing happened in 2013 run, we should definitely be prepared for the 2021 bull run to have reached it's end.

The second theory, is an impending US stock market crash.  Looking back to the bitcoin chart, we see a large price drop occurring in March 2020, exactly lining up with the COVID induced stock market crash.  One of the downsides to more widespread adoption and institutional investors is that when shit hits the fan for the stock market it will also hit the fan for the crypto market.  Right now there are inflation fears, craziness going on with the housing market, insanely high reverse rehypothecation action, and several other indicators that have not been seen since the 2007-2008 time period just before the 2008 stock market crash.  Even if it does happen, when it happens is anybody's guess, but a stock market crash is at least on the table and if it does happen its a pretty solid bet that the crypto market will crash too.

&amp;#x200B;

**Conclusion**

There are a lot of posts out there saying things like ""price will go to 250k!"", ""the bull run is not over"", ""we are definitely in a bear market"", ""crypto will crash further"", you guys get the gist.  In reality, there are several things working both for and against the crypto market and either one could take the reigns at any time.  The only proven strategy in the long term is to HODL for the big green candles.  Don't trade based on emotion or what anybody (including me) tells you what they think is going to happen.  The only thing anybody knows for certain is that nobody knows shit about fuck.","Some potential insight into indicators/events that can cause the crypto market to recover and resume bull mode, and some things that may lead us to further downside.",1626736440

CryptoCurrency," Here‚Äôs something interesting I found in the 2013 bull run for Bitcoin that might make you feel a little better. Obviously not financial advice and who knows what will happen but you still might want to check this out. I am not a TA guy at all but I did want to go back and look at the price action from 2013 since people talk about it so much and here‚Äôs what I found.

January 2013 Btc is around $13

April 2013 Btc is around $160

July 2013 Btc is approx. $90

October 2013 Btc is approx. $120

December 2013 Btc is around $1200

Just like in 2013, this year we peaked in april then had a big dip and contonue to crab. Not saying that were following this trend exactly but it does feel kind of similar. I mean corrections are normal through out Btc‚Äôs history. Nothing fundamental has changed for the worse imo which is why I continue to hold. 

With that being said, I do have money on the sideline and am waiting to buy the dip on Bitcoin and some other alts. Won't pull the trigger unless we see btc sub 30k, ideally below 28.  
And if youre stressed, re access why youre in Bitcoin or any other crypto. Do you really understand the project? When it goes down are you scared because you think you might lose money, or are you excited because you see an opportunity to buy an asset you love at a severely undervalued price. Most importantly, dont invest money you cant afford to lose. People say this all the time but then invest anyway. Assume every investment is a loss right away. there's nothing wrong with taking profits or hodling.

In my opinion thats the difference between the people that lose and win in any market. When dips come, the people that panic sell are the ones that have no idea why they bought in the first place and are the same people that will buy when the price doubles again.  
I wish all of you luck and if im wrong im willing to live with that. Just as bullish as I've ever been :)

Ethereum is the heir apparent in my eyes to the kingdom that BTC built; with a substantial use case, an ecosystem all its own, tons of development and potentially trillions of dollars moving through it. 

As Defi becomes a staple of the crypto world, Eth will continue to grow and grow, supposed ""killers"" will come and go or find their own niche and stick around (ADA, DOT, SOL, etc) but none of them are in my eyes going to be able to slay eth.

CryptoCurrency,"1. Hold On for Dear Life (HODL)

What started as a typo has become a rallying cry for crypto investors who don't sell their assets. For example, I'm a HODLer: I don't intend to sell my cryptocurrency for the next five or 10 years. Given the extreme volatility of crypto investments, HODLing is a good way to avoid panic-selling and focus on the long term.

2. Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt (FUD)

It's hardly surprising that what some dub the wild west of investing has its own acronym for the whirlwind of nervousness and apprehension that can come with it. The fact is, this is such a new industry that we can't be sure how it will pan out. This fuels constant rumors that the end is nigh -- or that Bitcoin (BTC) is about to rebound to its all-time highs.

You'll also see accusations that people are ""spreading FUD."" The connotation here is that they are deliberately sharing false or misleading information to influence a coin's price.

3. Fear Of Missing Out (FOMO)

That anxiety you feel when a coin on your watchlist suddenly jumps in price and you wonder if you should buy it so you don't miss out on any further gains? It has a name: FOMO. A lot of people who hadn't bought crypto had a severe case of FOMO back in March when prices seemed to go nowhere but up.

FOMO was officially added to the Oxford dictionary in 2013 and applies outside the crypto world, too.

4. Going to the moon

Crypto investors hope their coins might go to the moon. It's a stratospheric growth that sends the coin's price off the charts -- to the moon. Also known as mooning, you'll often find the term in memes and Reddit forums.

5. Diamond hands or paper hands

Serious HODLers have diamond hands -- referring to a diamond's ability to withstand enormous pressure. People with diamond hands do not sell, no matter what. In contrast, if someone has paper hands, they sell at the first sign of trouble.

On forums, having paper hands is usually used as an insult. But the truth is that sometimes it does make sense to sell a bad investment, even if you've lost money. It all depends on your investment strategy and personal situation.

6. Whales

Cryptocurrency whales own enough of the currency to have an outsized influence on the price. Back in 2017, about 1,000 people owned 40% of all the Bitcoin in circulation. Many of these Bitcoin whales bought into crypto early. Famous whales include the Winklevoss twins, ‚Äã‚ÄãTim Draper, and Michael Saylor.",New to Crypto? Acronyms you Should Know,1626732748

The whole thread repeatedly states that crypto is a tool for the rich and extracts money from the poorer, yet fails to explain at all how this is an inherent feature as he calls it.

This isn't even nearly enough to beat inflation, which means you‚Äôre losing purchasing power, LOSING money every year by keeping it in a savings account. Hell, some places in the EU have NEGATIVE interest rates, which means you're literally paying a bank to keep your money. It has become literally impossible to simply save your money in traditional finance without losing purchasing power. This is why DeFi and Staking are game changers.

I was in the green with all my crypto and of course I felt I had everything figured out. I was in it for the long haul (I still am for that matter). I followed advices from all of you guys. Did not invest more than I'm afraid to lose, and set dates to buy more once a month as a type of savings with a chance to boom.

As I was talking about it with my best friend I said that I think it is great to be investing in crypto and that I believe there is a future for cryptocurrencies my friend FOMOd hard.  I did not know at the time, and I told him that I invested maybe 1/7 of my monthly salary and that I think that crypto is still pretty much gamble, my friend went and got a loan and bought BTC, ETH and DOGE as his wife likes dogs ( I know, his reasoning is astounding). 

I own ADA, ALGO and VET primarily and am looking to enter BTC and ETH after we sell our old car ( car is worth maybe 800$) so still it wont be great positions and I told my friend that so I can't fathom doge.

He got a loan with a big interest as those are high for a loan without purpose, don't know what those are called overseas (there is a loan to buy a car or a house that have low interests rates), bought a lot of crypto and is now massively in the red, I feel responsible for even mentioning crypto like a utter newb.

CryptoCurrency,"Hey all. Welcome to some OC weird shit with Francis.

So recently I have been using Brave browser as a way to liberate myself from the horrifically normalized predatory practice that is targeted advertising. It has been about three months and I would like to share some interesting metrics concerning the violation of privacy that nearly every single person who regularly browses the internet is constantly and unwittingly subjected to.

During my brief time using Brave Browser (3 months) I have avoided nearly 54 THOUSAND ads and trackers, saved 2 GB of data, and last but not certainly not least saved about a whole hour of my life (I will not mention BAT rewards here cause let‚Äôs face it folks, they don‚Äôt amount to jack shit). 

Upon reviewing these statistics I was absolutely astonished. I know that we are all being watched, all of our information is frequently stolen, and, to top it all off, that same info is forcefully shoved back down our own throats with no regard as to how any of us may or may not feel about this process. BUT I HAD NO IDEA TO WHAT MAGNITUDE.

Now I know what you are thinking: ‚Äúbut Francis how will I know what to buy if the corporate overlords don‚Äôt make all my choices for me???? I am but a wee babe!!!‚Äù And to that I say: ‚ÄúI know baby, but sit back, let these numbers run and then holler at me‚Äù

If you assume that I have average browsing habits (which I do) and that only half of the World Population regularly browses the Internet, the numbers are pretty damn scary. So scary in fact that I had to turn my phone sideways to even be able to do the math.

With these parameters in mind, over the last three months Internet users have been subject to approximately 216,000,000,000,000 trackers/ads.

Close to 8 billion gigabytes of data is required to send and receive all this information. Guess who is paying for all of this shit? (If your guess isn‚Äôt ‚Äúme‚Äù then you are wrong)

Most worrisome is the fact that 8 billion hours of people‚Äôs lives are required to load, view, and hate these ads. 

This is essentially a quarterly report, meaning that over a year these numbers will be about 4x the ones I have listed. Think about how long this has been going on for. Think about exactly how many resources have been fruitlessly wasted in the name of conning a person by stealing their private info and feeding it back to them. It‚Äôs fucking literally insane.

I know that these numbers are not set in stone, but this is a thought exercise to help you get a ballpark idea of just how predatory and wasteful this advertising ‚Äúindustry‚Äù actually is. We‚Äôve only spoken about the internet. Do you watch tv? Listen to the radio? Go to the movies? Watch dvds? 

It‚Äôs gonna get to a point where a meaningful percentage of our lives is spent watching ads we do not want to see for things that we do not need and we will pay our internet provider for this obstruction and we will pay with time off of our lives clock.

Also, another rabbit hole I won‚Äôt go down: This unnecessary expenditure of energy is HORRIBLE for the environment. But you will not ever hear about that because you are being treated as a product and they are making bank hand over fist selling you to yourself.

CryptoCurrency,"While I believe Crypto itself will help improve my financial wellbeing, I am also incredibly thankful for the other financial lessons Crypto has taught me.   I am curious if anyone else has had this same experience. 

So I take the Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA) strategy when it comes to crypto. I buy the same coins, with the same amount of money each and every week, regardless of price. When I first adopted this approach I had determined an amount of money that I could reasonably invest each week, without being financially compromised if it all went to zero. That then led me down the road of looking for ways to eliminate ferocious expenses I was making in my day to day life. Things like cutting out recurring subscription services that I had forgotten about. I pretty much exclusively cut out DoorDash and food delivery services and started cooking at home (now it is a fun hobby). I trimmed everywhere I reasonably could and added it to my DCA amount.  The best thing - I don't even miss these things because I had little awareness of where I was spending all of my money. 

Now I know where exactly every dollar I earn is going. And I primarily credit Crypto for that. It gave me a goal which drove me to really dig into my spending habits and create a budget. Even if everything goes to zero tomorrow, I will still be thankful for crypto for helping me get on top of my finances.",Crypto has really helped my spending/saving habits.,1626730674

(Don't worry, have some other emergency resorces available as well for next 6 months.)  ETH is finally within reach. Should I get one?

CryptoCurrency," I wanted to talk about BTC and the possibility of it falling out of the no. 1 spot within the next 3-5 years. I am not saying BTC is going to fail. I am not saying BTC is going to zero. In fact, I believe by the time a project flips BTC, BTC will be well above $500k.

A lot of people got into crypto in the last 6 months and consider themselves ""late to the party"" but this is in fact not the truth. The crypto markets as a whole are roughly 1 decade old(I know, BTC genesis was 2009) but exchanges didn't come to fruition until &gt;2010).

For reference, the stock market is between 150-200 years old. You don't have to go back 25-50 years to see how much the top market cap companies have changed. Simply look 10 years ago. My point being the crypto markets as a whole is still in the very early years(assuming they don't fail and collapse).

To simply say that BTC will be no. 1 for the next 10 years is naive and short-sighted. Emerging and new technologies cause paradigm shifts in markets. I believe that between 2023-2025 we will see Ethereum 's market cap equal or exceed that of BTCs. BTC is good for being a store of value and a hedge against inflation. Ethereum is that and more. It is a triple-point asset.

1. a monetary asset which can be used as a store of value.

2. A commodity(used to pay for blocks).

3. A capital asset (staking).

Also ERC-20 tokens(50% of the alt market) can be built along with Dapps(Decentralized applications). There are probably additional uses that I am missing.

Point being, with regards to use-case, ETH is simply better technology with more uses when compared to BTC. Again, I am not saying BTC is bad or dying. BTC does one thing really well. That is to act as a store of value and hedge against inflation. It will continue to do this well for many years to come. 

**A comparative insightful example of what could happen:**

Cell phones. Before 2007 personal phones were primarily flip-phones and had keyboards. There was no ‚Äútouch screen‚Äù device where the full UI consisted of a touch screen(bye bye buttons!).

Then, Apple has its big debut- the iphone. The rest is history. Did Motorola and Nokia die off? Absolutely not, but they no longer lead the cell phone industry. I believe that ETH is the Apple of crypto. 

This could very well be the beginning of the ‚ÄúEthereum Era‚Äù whereas the past 10 years have been dominated by BTC.

# What is a smart contract?

A smart contract is a contract but smart.

# That really doesn't help

Essentially, me making this post right now is actually a smart contract. When I make a post, a smart contract is made between me and Reddit saying that I am going to make this post and I will not break any of Reddit's rules. This contract is of course on the Ethereum blockchain, where it remembers all the post made on Reddit.

# Why are they useful?

They are useful because you can do some cool things with it. Anybody can make a smart contract. Another example is when you want to send 100 Ethereum to your neighbor every Saturday. You can make a smart contract that remembers it and always sends that 100 Ethereum to your neighbor, it even sends them when you are dead. That's why it's called a smart contract, it's a contract, but it actually remembers what it's used for, unlike contracts.

# Why do they exist?

They exist so they can make everyone's life miserable.

# Why would I ever listen to a Monkey?

Because why not?

Of course I would agree with this. The only reason you will not hold is that you reached the target for your exit strategy or that you will not believe that crypto has a future anymore. For most of us this is not the case. Everyone here thinks that crypto is still in his baby steps and this means that it would be a waste to get out now.

What does this mean? It means that you're here for a long term investment. Hoping that in a few years we can retire early, be able to buy a house or to make sure your kids can go to college.

So if you don't plan to cash out before a year of 5/6 maybe more. Why care if BTC is 30k or 50k, for both possibilities we wouldn't get out. If the market is rising 10% in one day, a lot of people get hyped and if it crashes the same amount, some get depressed. But in the long term this really doesn't matter. Buying ADA at $1.20 or $1.50 doesn't really matter if you want to cash out at $10. Buying BTC at 30k or 50k doesn't matter if you think it will reach 500k.

People care way too much about these margins, just invest what you can at the time that you want and don't wait endlessly on the ""perfect"" price to buy.

Ps. Of course it is always a good option to have a portion of your wallet available to buy a dip. And I'm not saying that you should use this part to buy crypto now you've read this. I'm saying that you don't have to worry that a market is dipping or rising. And you certainly shouldn't feel bad if you bought higher that the current price.

For crypto is DCAing per week (or monthly) a good way to keep our finance and sanity healthy (as long as you only spend what you can afford to lose).

No matter if dip, major dip, baby peak or sideway movement, when you DCA regulary you will spend your fiat most of the time when the crypto price is not at peak times because peaks only last few weeks and sideway last months or years. You also have no fiat left to FOMO since everything you afford to lose is already used in DCAing. FOMO usually makes you lose.

DCA helps sanity because you have a simple and clear plan. No matter what price, you invest the same amount everytime. Up and downs of the cryptocharts doesn't matter which would otherwise let your bloodpressure boil.

CryptoCurrency,"There is no such thing as best or worse especially when you deal with crypto. However I would suggest some methods/ formula whenever you are entering this field and keep some points of caution in mind .

This is going to be long, but if you are serious about it , be patient and read it all. I am trying to be exhaustive here because I want people to know each and every aspect and invest accordingly :)

First let me get to the points of caution :-

1. Never get greedy and put all your money in crypto. Put max 10‚Äì20% of your portfolio even if you get very high returns.

2. Keep track of your investments(except 1 scenario which I will mention below 1st point in formula). Don‚Äôt invest in crypto if you want to forget it/ if you see /check your portfolio after 2‚Äì3 days. It needs constant attention (unlike mutual funds for eg)

3. Avoid FOMO - just because someone else is investing doesn‚Äôt mean you also need to invest. It doesn‚Äôt work like that, everyone‚Äôs journey is different.

4. Be alert of news of ban/ regulation of crypto in India but Till then don‚Äôt be afraid and make use of it as it‚Äôs not illegal at all right now. Also if there is any. Ban, they will give you appropriate time to put your money in bank(hopefully!!). Also be prepared to pay tax for any returns you get(don‚Äôt try to bypass it)

5. Don‚Äôt use your salaried account for transactions(I believe it‚Äôs best all these apps shouldn‚Äôt be given access to our salaried accounts)

6. Just because there has been a very amazing past performance doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs going to perform the same way in future. Be smart about it

7. Whenever I mention profit % , loss % also applies parallels(I.e high profit % chance of 1 crypto then high loss % chance also of that cryto)

8. There is a saying don‚Äôt put all your eggs in basket- try to apply here (might not be possible everytime)",What is the best cryptocurrency to invest in right now?,1626726180
CryptoCurrency,"People always say ""bull markets make you money, but bear markets make you rich"". 

While this may be true, the reality is most people are not ballsy enough to buy during or shortly after a freefall. 

In a crab market, most of the high adrenaline emotional based FOMO/FUD is out of the system, and you can slowly invest and grow your investment.

I've been in crypto since late 2014, and one of the biggest failures that I see from others like myself, other than paper handing and giving up during crashes, is **boredom during crab markets**.

Bitcoin crabbed for most of 2015, and I ended up slowly losing interest as I had a bunch of other real life problems.

I never sold; but I ended up taking a hiatus, until the top of the 2017 bull run. 

Got hyped again, still diamond handed my holdings, but lost interest again because of real life and the following crab market during late 2018-'19 etc. until may of this year again.

I've seen many people like me, some of them in this very sub. And while I myself have made some very good gains, I missed out on the best part of each of the previous bull runs. I could have made so much more.

Crab markets see most of the good development. Because usually, either some new development (like ICOs in 2017 or DeFi in 2020) drives the bull run, or perhaps the bull run drives these new developments.

But there's so much opportunity right at the cusp of a new bull run; for example, we saw DOT, UNI, CAKE, SUSHI etc; all relatively new coins that really exploded this current bull market.

Previously, there was NEO, NANO, VET, to name a few.

The challenge isn't trying to time the market to buy at the bottom.

The challenge is to continue persisting and not giving up or forgetting about it, and pay attention to new developments every once in a while so you don't miss out on the next bull run.",Opinion: Surviving Crab markets is what make you Rich.,1626726163

CryptoCurrency,"Hey everyone, 

I worked really hard to make my 100 karma but here we are, finally being able to post.

I wanted to share some of the things I did to increase my bi-weekly investments toward crypto in hopes that it helps some of you. All $ shown is in CAD.

TLDR; everything after this will be an extension to this piece, most important tip i can give to those making ends meet is having a serious sit down with yourself and calculating your expenses over the past 6 months. Find the spending habits that are consistent and cut as many of them as you feel comfortable, more you cut, more possible gains in the end.

1. I was a consistent smoker, smoking 2 packs every 3 days costing me about 250$ a month it was hard but after 4 months of weening I finally moved on to vaping costing me 20$ a month with the same amount of nicotine to me. Giving me an extra 230$ a month to crypto.

2. Coffee and snacks: now this was a massive one for me  i couldn't believe the amount i was spending on almost daily snack buys. Chocolate  one day chips another etc. Even though it may not look like much and you view it as ""the one little thing you treat yourself with""  cut it, and thank yourself later, on average i would spend 50$ a month on snacks and 100$ in coffee, I quit drinking coffee which was easy for me but may end up being extra difficult for you but stick to it and if it helps change out your daily habits, I feel this helps a lot when cutting a habitual action. 

3. Alcohol and weed: another doozy, probably for a lot of us, but let me just start with this, if you do not have ""a lot"" of money, whatever that is to you, cut your habit. Doesn't have to be perfect but 100$ a week/month is a huge net waste that you could turn into massive profits later, and again you'll be thanking yourself later, as will your body. Don't go out drinking every weekend, if that's your thing, cut it to every other week, then once a month. Stop filling your fridge with beer and your freezer with vodka, its just not worth it, and the incentive is fantastic if you are struggling with alcoholism. For me I was a social drinker I would go out 1-3 times a week spending around 400$ a month, with weed I would spend 280$ a month(1 expensive ounce looking back) now I still smoke an ounce a month but have found myself a friend who sells to me for 60$/Oz and I stopped going out to drink. 

All in all cutting these habits over the last year has changed my 100$ bi-weekly investment into a 450 bi-weekly investment, along with leasing a car and working less hours. Even now I could cut more out of my life and probably benefit heavily from it later but i'm happy with what I have achieved so far, and I believe if you start no matter how small, you would too. Don't be perfect but genuinely try, you're worth it.

CryptoCurrency,"**Overview:** Polkadot is a heterogeneous multi-chain interchange and translation architecture which enables customised side-chains to connect with public blockchains. Essentially Polkadot enables scalability by allowing specialized blockchains to communicate with each other in a secure, trust-free environment.   

**What makes PolkaDot unique:** Polkadot enables a multi chain network which can scale, specialise and work together through sharing data.    

**Current reasons to invest:**    
    
**1. It appears to be undervalued according to some key metrics.**    Polkadot is trading far below its 200 day exponential moving average at -43.5% (20.4166 200EMA to 11.53 current) compared to Bitcoin which is -16.4% (36,818.32 200EMA to 30,750.20 current), Etherium which is up +12.4% (1,624.7640 200EMA to current 1,826.73) and ADA which is +39% (0.849238 200EMA to 1.1808 current). Further metrics has been covered in more depth by [u/galensmith](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/olpxi3/polkadot_seems_undervalued_key_metric_analysis/).    
    
** 2. High Yield Staking**    
You can currently earn up to 12% APY staking DOT. Kraken offers ~12% APY, Binance Earn offers ~11% while staking from a DOT wallet has a estimated 13% APY but it is important to note that you require a minimum of 40 DOT to stake and earn rewards from an official wallet.    
    
**3. Parachains are imminent**   
Parachains are individual blockchains running in parallel within the Polkadot ecosystem (the Polkadot and Kusama networks). The design of the Polkadot ecosystem enables parachains and parathreads to interoperate and communicate with each other, allowing the exchange of data and assets, and to connect to external chains outside the network, such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, using bridges. This flexibility addresses the problems of scalability, security and interoperability that have hampered blockchain development. Parachains are currently being rolled out with parachain auctions are due to be launched by Polkadot in late 2021. [Source:](https://polkadot.network/launch-roadmap/).   
    
**4. 4. High Institutional Ownership**    
As of 16th of July PolkaDot has the 3rd highest instiutional ownership behind Bitcoin and Etherium, indicating institutional faith in Polkadot‚Äôs medium term sucess. [Source:](https://coinshares.com/research/digital-asset-fund-flows	)    
    

**Overview: ** Polkadot appears to be quite undervalued at the moment which combined with instituional faith, a high APY yield from staking and imminent novel process releases makes it a good Cryptocurrency to pick up for a medium term hold.

CryptoCurrency,"Hi, after working for some (long) time, I formulated a proposition for a new consensus protocol in blockchain networks. I wanted to create a protocol that achieves true decentralisation, both in its operation and distribution of coins as rewards (so decentralising wealth). I believe that PoS blockchains can't do that, because they must distribute coins initially to some small group of investors and then those investors get the block rewards. Protocols using some real-world resources (like hashing in PoW) eventually get centralised, as few entities, using technological optimisation of hardware (ASICs), geographically-dependent advantages (cheap electricity in some parts of the world) or just through economies of scale (buying hardware cheaper) eventually capture the distribution of coins and wealth coming from the system.

My proposition:

\-Proof-of-Used-Bandwidth: the more Internet bandwidth a user invests, the more likely he is to become a block producer.

\-Geographically-bounded blockchains: there is not just one blockchain; everyone can create a blockchain version that uses Proof-of-Used-Bandwidth, but only the bandwidth originating from a selected geography (from a country or even a region) can be used to compete to produce a block in this blockchain version.

\-All geographically-bounded blockchains are interoperable without the need for some central chain over all of them. So even if there are many blockchains, and each one allows to use bandwidth from a specific region, still all form one whole.

Advantages:

\-In each blockchain users compete based on same conditions: if it's the same country, they have similar bandwidth costs (I'm assuming that they are buying bigger amounts of dedicated bandwidth), similar cost of hardware (no ASICs apply here, because it uses bandwidth, so cannot be optimised like this), same electricity costs, etc. This is a great advantage, because there really is not much that can cause an oligopoly.

\-Unlimited scalability, because there are many (theoretically unlimited number) networks, each covering some area, and all are interoperable with each other. No need for central chain over all of them.

I think it can be an interesting idea and I analysed the design that I came up with repetitively for quite some time and couldn't find a flaw.

However, this design is very complex and it's described on many pages. What should I do with it now? If it could work, and I believe it could, it would be a very big step forward. But I don't know anyone in crypto-space and my name is completely unknown. I would like this to become someday a community-driven project.

I don't want anything from anyone and I'm not trying to promote myself or my idea. I just want a hint from someone ""in the know"" - how should I progress now? The whitepaper and detailed documentation are on my website:

	On any given day, at any given time, there is an enormous amount of money that is traded in the digital currency market. Buyers are spending fiat currency to purchase more crypto and expand their portfolios. Sellers are making a profit or cutting their losses and dumping huge amounts of their portfolios in order to ‚Äúcash out.‚Äù While the average individual goes about their day at work, crypto day traders are participating in a very volatile work space where millions of dollars can be made or lost within seconds. Who are these people who are willing to accept this demanding lifestyle and extremely high level of daily stress?

	Pioneers. These folks, who in some cases, put their entire livelihood on the line ever day are the REAL PIONEERS of a currency revolution. As long as there have been human beings on this planet, there have been pioneers. People who risk or sacrifice much more than anyone else in order to bring about a change or an advancement for mankind. If Christopher Columbus never traveled by ship across the Atlantic seeking the ‚Äúnew world‚Äù of North America, or if Lewis and Clark never journeyed through the rough terrain that they did in order to reach the Oregon coast then our world would be a lot different. We need these types of pioneers to propel us into the next way of the future.

	The importance of change in the way we as human beings view money cannot be overstated. The current monetary system is dated and due for an upgrade. This is what drives an industry like cryptocurrency even in the face of such a high level of volatility. The individuals involved in this industry do not feel that it is too risky to predict that the idea of money can be viewed entirely differently. Why should anyone be at the mercy of a bank or institution in order to get the access to the money that they have earned or saved? Why can‚Äôt an individual send all or some or fractions of their own money to anyone in the world instantly with their smartphone that is already connected to most of the globe via the internet? These questions are at the very core of human curiosity. Every time a major change has come throughout history, it started with a question of why.

	Does all of this mean that the people who search the web for get rich quick schemes and wait for free airdrops from up-and-coming token companies are as important to history as explorers of new worlds and trail blazers? No. It means that collectively, every single person involved in the evolution of money including folks in the crypto space are paving the way for a better future. Taking risks and making sacrifices are simply a stepping stone toward the eventual goal of a one-world-currency. Traders might make a trade that doesn‚Äôt pan-out and they lose their initial investment. Buyers and sellers may choose to complete an order that immediately backfires several minutes later. Regardless of the possibility of these scenarios, those of us in this industry understand the importance of what we are trying to accomplish and there is nothing that will stop us. So yeah, the real appeal of crypto isn‚Äôt exactly to get-rich-quick.

CryptoCurrency,"""Not your keys, not your coins""  


We have all heard it, even those of us who are new to the space.  This is a warning about exchanges getting hacked, or going bankrupt, and that Cryptocurrency that you got to look at whenever you logged in simply vanishing.

&amp;#x200B;

I knew this was true, I know this is true, but I had three reasons to keep my coins on an exchange.    


1.)  The gas fees are too high.  I'm definitely a dabbler, I don't have a huge purse, and moving my coins was just too much of a percentage loss for me to stomach.  


2.)  I'm a bumbling fool.  I lose my physical (cash, license, debit card) wallet every 18 months due to general incompetence.  Luckily my bank account isn't emptied every time, but my wallet is.  If something like this were to happen with my Trezor (or, more accurately, with my seed phrase), it's gone gone without any sort of customer support to help me out.  


3.)  My exchange gives me interest on my holdings.  I know this is because they are staking or lending, and they are making more on it than they are paying me, but it takes the work out of my hands, and there is some value in that.  


These 3 reasons were only balanced by the fact that my holdings were small, and if I lost it all to a hack, that wasn't the end of the world.  However I've now been buying a bit more every week, and now my holdings are starting to add up.  It's at least worth more than my crappy 10 year old car.

&amp;#x200B;

So my question for the room is, when does it become worth it to make the transfer?  I'm 60% in Eth and Btc, and 40% in a dozen altcoins (I know that's imbalanced.  I hit minimums to receive interest on alt coins, now I'm DCAing into Btc and Eth to eventually reach a better balance).

CryptoCurrency,"Looking at Bitcoin‚Äôs original white paper, it‚Äôs focus was on making a widely useable, worldwide, online, cryptocurrency.

‚ÄúWhat is needed is an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust, allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted third party. 

Transactions that are computationally impractical to reverse would protect sellers from fraud, and routine escrow mechanisms could easily be implemented to protect buyers.‚Äù

Of course since then, Bitcoin has become a phenomenon in terms of it‚Äôs purported value against the $.

And yet, I can‚Äôt help think that inflated value stands against its original use case and actively prohibits Bitcoin from being adopted on a mass scale - and through association, prevents cryptocurrency doing the same.

While BTC plays out, many would also be holding altcoins through this bear run. While alts are great during a bull run, during a BTC bear cycle they are some of the worst assets to hold. 

During the 2017 bull run too, many favourite altcoins emerged that were shilled here relentlessly. Today you will not find anyone talking about them, and possibly the team / coin has folded too. Some examples are Request Network, Power ledger, Substratum, Vertcoin, Groestlecoin, Waltcon chain, Dash, Qtum, Bytecoin, Omise Go, Ardor, Game Credits, Stratis, Dragon Chain, KIN, Factom etc. These coins also had a huge following back in 2017 bull run. Many were expecting these coins to ""change the world"". Daily's from 2017 and 2018 were filled with mentions of these conis. Some of these coins were notorious and there were massive threads full of shills trying to explain how a chain would take over the world and change businesses for good. 

Ultimately, most of these coins had to fold either due to lack of funds, lack of planning, or just a soft exit scam where the team kinda go MIA during a 2 year bear run. The soft exit scam is the most common and least effort one - in crypto, the developers have to develop something, but they can always say they tried and failed. On to the next one. Tough luck! There are no legal contracts in place that force the devs to deliver anything for you, the token holder. 



In this 2020-21 bull run, there are way more altcoins. Many of them clearly struggle for even a single use case. The story with most altcoins is that the devs use them to raise funds,  come up with a list of promises and then abandon them. The IDO/IEO culture has resulted in thousands of fund raises for just copy cat projects that dont have any viable future. Many of the swaps and DEX we have now wont be around in just 2 years from now. The tokens associated with them will be worth nothing. 

Of course, some of the promising alts will be available for dirt cheap prices during the bear market and have a chance of gaining back their ATHs, but for most other projects the fall to earth is going to be more or less permanent.","There is a strong possibility of a long bear market.

What are the most common Crypto scams?

There are many actually and new ones appear every day so you have to be aware.

Fake Bitcoin Exchanges.¬†Scammers present themselves as a part of a big trading platform than scam you once you transfer funds to them

Cloud mining.¬†Scammers ask if you want to buy equipment for mining which will stay on their end. Don‚Äôt get me wrong there are some good companies out there but they don‚Äôt advertise and get oversubscribed quickly.

Fake ICO/IEO/IDO.¬†Scammers impersonate admin of a big project and ask you for some funds in turn for good allocation in tokens. Good projects will never write you first.

Fishing scam.¬†Always check the links and info you‚Äôre typing on a platform. This is the most common scam for google SERP results. Be aware.

Fake wallets.¬†Scammers will ask you to download some upgraded version of BTC wallet. Don‚Äôt fall for this, and always use official websites for wallets.

Fake hardware wallets.¬†Don‚Äôt buy hardware wallets from anywhere except official stores. This devices can later compromise your funds.

I might forget some, please share your thoughts in the comments below.

Always remember, cryptocurrency transactions are irreversible so if you don‚Äôt pay much attention to your security no-one will help you to recover your funds. It‚Äôs like giving your pocket cash to a scammer and then complain to police for it.

I'm trying to understand the premium price of the Trezor and why so many people recommend it, thus a few questions:

&amp;#x200B;

1. One of the features that I like about the Ledger is the ability to view all of my balances offline - am I correct in understanding that the Trezor must be plugged in even just to view your portfolio?
2. My understanding is I can still stake e.g. Ada with the Ledger - but I couldn't find any information as to whether this feature was available with the Trezor.
3. Trezor's source code on Github is an often cited ""feature"" - but is there any way to validate that the code they've shared is what is actually on the device?
4. I see Trezor's touch display as more of an anti-feature... looking at YT videos it seems pretty dang small.  Would someone with normal adult hands have a difficult time using it?  Am I going to have to keep a stylus handy?

As of January 1st 2021:

‚Ä¢ Amp: &gt;1 penny 
‚Ä¢ Ada: 18 cents 
‚Ä¢ Algo: 40 cents 
‚Ä¢ Link: $11.88 
‚Ä¢ Eth: $730 
‚Ä¢ Btc: $29,400

And I think this ‚ÄúBuy the dip‚Äù mentality is pretty ridiculous. If you‚Äôre going to buy crypto, buy to accumulate more at the best prices you can, but don‚Äôt be too concerned that we‚Äôre no where near ATH‚Äôs at this current moment. 

Crypto is a long term game, the patient ones win out, don‚Äôt expect to get rich quick and don‚Äôt be distraught when you‚Äôre down. However, with this information, we can be better prepared to make better decisions in the future. 

This is not financial advice, but I remember someone saying in the daily once: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt sell on red days and don‚Äôt buy on Green Day‚Äôs‚Äù -it‚Äôs simple but effective.

CryptoCurrency,"If you haven‚Äôt heard this term before it wouldn‚Äôt surprise me. Stake pools are relevantly new.

**Pool Splitters** are pool operators that have done so well, that they need to create more pools because their first is at the limit. Or they are doing well enough to create another pool even before saturation, say 50% saturation.

As a business model its great. They do well, and want to keep doing well, so they create another pool.

Most are successful YouTubers.

There are a few problems with this though.

First, lets talk about what you really care about, yourself.

As a delegator, your want best rewards. Sure you may like the cause of the content, but at the end of the day you want the most ADA you can get for delegating.

If you look at these pool splitters most have 4-5% margins. Even when the stake is still low, its set the same.

So while I agree 5% margin for a fully saturated pool might not be bad, its certainty not giving the best rewards to their delegators.

Then you have the bigger problem of supporting decentralization and new pools.

If the ideal pool count is 500 today, that means the best possible layout is 500 unique entities running 500 different single pools.

But if you look at the numbers [https://adapools.org/groups](https://adapools.org/groups) you‚Äôll see thats not the case.

63 pools are Binace (that‚Äôs a whole other problem)

29 pools for PCT

9 pools New Girl

I could go on, check out the list yourself

Single Pool operators hold only 22% of all the stake.

The rest is held by groups with more then 1 pool, and a third of ADA is still on Exchanges staked with them.

In fact of the top 500 pools, you won't find many that only have 1 pool.

So if you want the **BEST** returns, and to **support the best decentralization**, choose one of the many single pool operators out there.

Check out their website.

Check out their team.

Check out their infrastructure (many are not ready for smart contracts)

Sound familiar? It was some hell of what felt like an endless stream of FUD that they spread on Apple, which as you may know is only the most valuable company in the world today.

They scared my poor immigrant dad who came to this country with nothing and started investing in his youth, out of his Apple stock in the '97 for a small $40k profit with their endless stream of FUD news lies. That news stopped him from ever investing back into the market.

And that stock he was scared into selling would be worth millions today. I can only imagine how many other people they scared out of that stock and others like it, who could have greatly improved their lives with those internet tech stock assets.

CryptoCurrency,"Hey all,

If you're in this subreddit, you may be interested in investing. I'd love to get your thoughts on a problem I have.

I've been investing for about a decade, have a decent amount of experience, &amp; have reached that point in my life where I'd rather not have to check/work on my portfolio frequently.

I'm struggling to find a way to deal with this. Robos are boring &amp; uncustomizable, &amp; I'm not sure I want to trust/pay an FA.

Basically: I want to use my experience to set up my ideal investing strategy, &amp; then let it run in a way that doesn't require (or encourage) my attention. This could mean things like periodic rebalances, &amp;/or push-notification style alerts to let me know when there has been meaningful portfolio movement. Otherwise, I want it out of sight &amp; out of mind.

So my question: Can you relate to this? What have you done to solve this kind of problem, if anything? I've seen some posts around this, trying to figure out if it's a real problem for folks.

Even if you haven't solved it, I'd love to hear from you. I'm considering building something if no good alternative exists. Would love to hear from you in the comments.

By the way: I know this kind of hands-off approach to investing is not everyone's style, especially these days. Please only comment if this is something you can relate to.

I'm presuming that the influx of new alts and shitcoins has seriously skewed the BTC dominance ratio. And I presume we will see more and more alts in the future

If we compare the prices from the top, most alts lost 50% in BTC price and that's all fine. What is strange is that BTC dominance still hovers around 45%

If BTC is to retake 70% or 80% dominance in the future, alts could see some serious damage. And I am not talking about shiba or safemoon. I am talking about serious projects that are losing value when compared to BTC

While everything was growing and of course dipping I was constantly watching all the graphs and I slowly started to become obsessed with crypto.

I know that, at the current moment, there are a *lot* of games, most of which I haven‚Äôt played. Many of them aren‚Äôt fully developed, and many of them aren‚Äôt very fun/replay-able. And there also aren‚Äôt a lot of earnest reviews of them out there. 

Anyone got links to quality, fair, reviews or have one of your own?

I‚Äôll start. I‚Äôve played several hours now of Town Star. It‚Äôs like a faster paced FarmVille on the block by the same guy who co-founded Zynga and worked on FarmVille, Eric Schiermeyer, but their new project is called the Gala Network. It‚Äôs pretty big, most of y‚Äôall have probably heard of it. If not, it‚Äôs easily [Googled](https://app.gala.games). 

Anyways, it was fairly fun. But it wasn‚Äôt something I‚Äôd put a bunch of time into. I feel like old games on Facebook were super addicting, but so far, I haven‚Äôt found a crypto game, Town Star included, that hooked me. I say that as someone who grew up playing Atari and Nintendo games on old consoles in the late 80s and early 90s, so I‚Äôm not adverse to old games or games that aren‚Äôt throttling a GPU to the Max. 

In Town Star, you‚Äôre competing with other players to build the most profitable farm over the allotted time. The winner gets some native coins.

CryptoCurrency,"I‚Äôve been seeing a lot of posts about sh*tcoins lately. Coins that pump a ton at the start, and then dump X100.

Even top 10 coins can be worthless in a year or two. So it‚Äôs not just the sh*tcoins that you need to be careful about. Here are some rules you should live by before investing into these ‚Äúprojects‚Äù. 

1. Don‚Äôt invest in them unless you‚Äôre literally treating them like a lottery ticket. Sure you may make money on some of these, but the majority you will lose. And not just lose, you may not even be able to salvage anything out of it due to liquidity issues and or gas fees. 

2. If you‚Äôre heading it promoted by someone, whether it be on social media, YouTube, or even Reddit, you‚Äôre already too late. These moon shots do make people A LOT of money. But it‚Äôs usually not the average investor. It‚Äôs mainly the promotors or the people behind the promoting. 

3. If a group is trying to pump a coin at 3:00pm Saturday STAY AWAY! This usually means a bunch of people are already holding the coin and when it comes time to ‚Äúpump‚Äù it, these people will be dumping it and the price will actually go lower. 

4. If liquidity is an issue, stay away! Coins with low volume may quadruple in a day, but on the other side of the coin, they can also lose 1000% in one day OR you may not have any buyers at all at X price so you‚Äôll never be able to get rid of it. 

5. Do your own DD on every coin you invest in. Talk to someone who you respect about it if you have any questions. About 99% of the time, there has to be a use case for a coin to be worth anything. Check the market cap on it. Is it feasible that if it does double/triple/etc in price, the market cap will still make sense? You can‚Äôt expect a coin to come out of nowhere and have a higher market cap than bitcoin or Ethereum. It‚Äôs just not going to happen. 

6. Check and see who owns the coin. If 90% of the coin is owned by one entity then you should probably stay away. 

7. If you‚Äôre interested in a coin, find a fanboy or the Reddit group and ask what‚Äôs so special about X coin. If they give vague answers or can‚Äôt really give any answers, then you probably should walk away. 

8. If you do invest, have an exit plan in place. Do not fomo and don‚Äôt emotion trade. Your portfolio will get wrecked if you do this. Sure if you want to put 2% of your portfolio into lottery picks, that could work. Putting all your portfolio into moonshot2022 coin is a terrible idea. 

Hope these rules helped! I hate to see people losing all their money on coins that aren‚Äôt even worth anything to begin with.

This post is made for educational content only, I hope you will learn something here that you did not before.

The world's largest ""democracy"" has almost always struggled with the finances, whether it is the utter failure of [demonetization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Indian_banknote_demonetisation) which essentially made your money instantly worthless overnight, or incredibly high interest rates from private moneylenders as well as banks for the farmers and other underprivileged. Banks screwing people over is pretty common.

The conditions of small-time farmers are pretty bad, the government has failed to show interest in improving their condition, a lot of people are undocumented and unbanked, but I could not find the solid numbers. Small landholders have to take loans at exorbitant rates, again I could not find the numbers but the Wikipedia article and some other sources say it can range from lower 30% to 60%. Not being able to pay off the debt causes these farmers to sell their crops at a significantly lower rates  than what they would actually go for in the market. Debt upon debt can lead to dire consequences 

This [report by Tata institute](https://web.archive.org/web/20130809074417/http://vnss-mission.gov.in/htmldocs/Farmers_suicide_TISS_report.pdf) cites various reasons why farmers commit suicide, this ranges from family responsibility, crop failure, debt and some lack of government interest. If you want the gist of the situation, I recommend this [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farmers%27_suicides_in_India). It more or less explains how bad the situation is, but it skips out on a lot.

There are moneylenders and landlords which are basically resorting to slavery for crop production. India, despite being an agrarian society has no infrastructure, transportation, cold storage and marketing, inefficiencies lead to significantly lower money going towards the farmers compared to other nations, that includes use of traditional practices for farming such as use of cattle for tilling the fields. 

The lack of transparency from the banks as well as government is something that should not be acceptable yet here we are, everything is getting more and more expensive here, the gas prices are more than ETH gas (I am sorry) despite being poor and majorly dependent on agriculture, India has failed its underprivileged time and again. This entire thing however is only a small part of a very big problem, and unfortunately it is not going away anytime soon.  I just find it funny that a lot of these problems can be solved with DeFi and only if people were to be educated about this.

CryptoCurrency,"1. Never sell precious cryptos for dirty fiat. 
2. If you think the market is going down, dump ETH and stack BTC, which is less volatile. 
3. If you think the market is going up, dump BTC and stack ETH. 

You never want to exit your exposure to the market, because it's impossible to tell when it's going to pump and leave you stranded. 

If you only use the top 2 coins, then even if you suck at guessing and get caught on the wrong end of the trade, you'll still be invested in something worthwhile. 

Continue never selling by using collateralized loans (aim for $10 in crypto for every $1 you borrow, which makes you safe from everything but a 90% market drop). In the long run ETH and BTC will appreciate faster than the interest you pay on the loans (as low as 1% interest with Celsius), so you never have to pay them off as long as you don't borrow too much. 

And best of all, never pay any taxes because you aren't repaying the loan or selling your coins.

Personally, I find myself always thinking in terms of fiat. How much is crypto X worth in fiat? When will I ""cash out"" and use it in the real world? 

Like that itself shows mentally I am not seeing a world where crypto is doing what cash is doing. I'm thinking can I pay off my mortgage with cash, as opposed to can I use crypto to actually own the house, with a mortgage deed written into blockchain.

Then on a wider level, this sub and the wider crypto community takes on stock trading terms. Bear markets, bull markets, using stock analysis methods and talking about market cap.

CryptoCurrency,"I'm wondering how does the crypto market get to a place where BTC doesn't pull down (or up) the rest of the market with its volatility? In its current state, I don't even have to look at my portfolio to see it's value. I can look at BTC's movement and guess within a few dollars, because most coins are tied to BTC. My question may be moot because there may not be a way to move away from BTC as the dominant pair (or doing so, may push ALTs through the floor). It's just really odd that each project is valued against such a volatile asset, meaning regardless of their innovation, partnerships or investments, if BTC is crashing, so are they. This leads to it being impossible to diversify.

This question may not even make sense in the grand scheme of things, as I understand that other forms of investment are also tied to an asset (fiat, gold, oil, etc). As a community we ask for adoption, but really what we need is stability. Zooming out helps, yes, and of course if you look back to December 2020 things look great. I'm also confident that if you (could) look forward to December 2025 things will look amazing. But both of those views are dependent on BTC's value. It feels as though, regardless of which crypto you invest in, the market needs BTC to move for your investment to move.

I can't promise that you ll convert those people into crypto enthusiast but rest assured it's an argument you are never loosing again in your life.

1) The basics of bitcoin and blockchain by Antony Lewis:
The book begins with a history of money, the prevalent banking system, different forms of money/currencies and how payment works establishing the intermediate system of payments against which bitcoin stands to compete. 
It then dives into cryptography including topics like private/public keys, hash functions, digital signatures and introduces you to every crypto jargon you will come across. Further it frames the idea of blockchain, what they are, the issues that they are trying to solve, problems that require solution and the weaknesses inherent to a blockchain.

2) The Internet of Money by Andreas M. Antonopoulos:
It is a collection of talks that the author gave and which can easily be found online but in case you are someone who prefers to read then the author has transposed all his speeches into this book. His take on scaling of Bitcoin network is particularly interesting and aims to thwart all the controversy regarding it. Linking his YouTube video on that topic. Would recommend to check his other vids before deciding to buy the book. The material is freely available online.

Brief intro: I'm a 3rd world country economics student a from Argentina. I write mainly about inflation and it's problems. Everyday I do research about a certain topic and publish the results at the subreddit, usually a good exchange of ideas comes at the comments. I do this both to share knowledge/create good content and to earn moons (they are a significant boost to my income). Yesterday u/feyd27 said that I should write about topic that are controversial in the sub but I agree with, so here I go (at the expense of potencial loses in moons). 

I'm completely open to changing my mind, please try to do so in the comments.

1.Tether ticking bomb is not exploding in the short term. Yes, tether is shaddy as hell (we can talk about the problems they have), yes they are iliquid, but as long as there is not a ""bank rush"" where everyone wants to convert USDT into dollars there is no problem, with very little cash banks are liquid too. Tether only had to make small interventions to push the value back to a dollar when it fell to 94 cents (yes, in the long term it will explode)

2.You don't can't time the market, but DCA everyday is not a perfect strategy. I have been to crypto since january. DCA on the way up from the bull run, cashed out at 56K because the analyst I follow showed his strategy showed the bull run was probably over. (I can make a post on the strategy with the graphs and indicators, explaining each). I didn't make a huge sum of money (like 100U$D) but that's like half a wage were I live. No, I couldn't sell the top, but at least I was liquid and now I can buy more BTC to hold for long term.
So DCA on bear market: great. Consider taking profits at bull to buy cheaper when bears come.

3.A loss is NOT a loss only when you sell. You can hold a rugpull, a pointless project, a scam etc and it's price will never recover, most crypto projects have and will fail long term, this happens in every industry, something better, cheaper comes and flips you. Just as Bitcoin will/has flipped the dollar.

4.Leverage is a tool, it's neither good nor bad. I only used 1-2x leverage when I traded, sometimes 1.5 (using x2 and adding cash). My profits rose a little compared to when I didn't use leverage. Yes, using leverage above 10x seems suicidal for me, but there are scalpers who make money, so who knows. Most definitely for the average Joe this is not a good strategy.

5.The bull run is over. The same indicator that showed weakness at the weekly timeframe is now showing weakness in the monthly timeframe. The other times it did this was when the last 2 bull runs were over. A bear market followed. When this happened almost every month the price fell below the previous month for at least 6 months. I hate to be pessimistic but sometimes it's better to be realistic. It was a nice ride! I really, really hope I'm wrong in this one. Also I wish it isn't over because we haven't hit the legendary 69k landmark. Just kidding, maybe next time.

Just want to start by saying MUCH WOW! 
what an awesome community; completely in love with crypto, the people developing the technology and the community surrounding it.
I started GPU mining in January and put some of my profits into Doge. Was lucky enough to cash out enough to buy 2 HNT miners (Bobcat 300) that are on their way.
I've also invested in a 5700XT (for games and mining when its not in use).
I've recently starting using a visa from crypto.com which is super awesome and makes crypto a lot more useable in day to day life.
It's been really amazing getting into this, doing a little day trading for fun with like...tiny amounts of doge to learn, seeing BTC balances build while GPU mining, anticipating my IOT devices.
Seriously an amazing space.
My friends are starting to get into it as well, we're kinda working together on the IOT devices and it's just awesome.
Feeling the love, seeing the results and looking forward to where this can go! 
Honestly a huge change.
I'm a pretty dedicated FIRE EFT guy; for me, crypto is a closed financial system separate from my regular income etc.

CryptoCurrency,"So in mainstream trading we have exchanges and brokerage firms. The brokerage firm acts as a middleman for traders. Discount brokerage firms is the ones we are seeing where there is no commission fee and I can see this start being a norm in crypto.

Anyways, it's impossible to tie crypto to the normal exchanges because they only operate given times of the day and given days of the week. So this needs to be a 24/7 exchange backed by the gov (there could be several around the world). Basically, the gov needs to make 2 types.

1. Regulated
2. Unregulated

Regulated crypto will be listed on this exchange. Now it can be listed on all other places. But regulated crypto is safer because it has to meet given rules, you know for 100% what is going on (no more this SEC going after your coin giving if it's on that exchange). The only risk when it comes to that is just like anything on the stock market where if a company does something bad, then that might cause the gov to go after them.

In order for regulated crypto to work there would need to be 100% black and white rules like what is in the normal stock market.  And like normal exchanges, the gov has the power to do the same things with things on that exchange.

Then there is unregulated. This is higher risk because you don't know how the gov is going to go after things. Like a SEC vs XRP thing can happen with them. I'm not saying the SEC would win, I'm saying there is just a risk. And note this doesn't just apply to the USA. Say if EU did something like this you will know what is on the official exchange is regulated and what isn't isn't regulated.

&amp;#x200B;

With both you should be able to still buy it on any place you do now. But this opens the door to most firms being extremely open to at least letting us trade any crypto on the regulated exchange. This meaning those who are worried about the FUD the news is putting out will know that this is safe since these coins are gov tested and the exchange is gov approved (so no more of this Binance US customer service BS). And this means we will see a lot more new money coming into the crypto space.

&amp;#x200B;

The one thing that should be noted is I can see the gov playing with words like what is a firm. This making it where Binance is a firm and they could pull rules saying that firms aren't allowed to buy from anything but on regulated exchanges.

Grayscale, the largest cryptocurrency investment manager, said Monday it has started a fund focused on decentralized finance (DeFi) tokens, based on a new DeFi-specific index produced by CoinDesk‚Äôs TradeBlock division.¬†

The companies, both subsidiaries of CoinDesk parent Digital Currency Group (DCG), wrote in a joint press release the Grayscale DeFi Fund provides ‚Äúexposure to a selection of industry-leading DeFi protocols through a market-capitalization weighted portfolio.‚Äù The idea is that investors can allocate money toward DeFi without having to buy the tokens directly.¬†

DeFi, which consists of blockchain-based software protocols designed for the trading and lending of cryptocurrencies, is one of the fastest-growing segments of the digital-asset industry. The amount of collateral locked into the protocols has increased 19-fold over the past year to [about $50 billion](https://defipulse.com/), and prices for many of the platforms‚Äô associated tokens have soared.¬†

‚ÄúBased on the user adoption that we‚Äôre seeing around DeFi and DeFi protocols, we do think the future of this area is bright,‚Äù Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein said in an interview Monday on CoinDesk TV‚Äôs [First Mover](https://www.coindesk.com/tv/first-mover) program.

The fund is only open to ‚Äúeligible individual and institutional accredited investors,‚Äù according to the press release. Grayscale said it ‚Äúintends to attempt to have shares of this new product quoted on a secondary market‚Äù but added that ‚Äúthere is no guarantee this will be successful.‚Äù¬†

The CoinDesk DeFi Index is a new product from TradeBlock, one of the first firms to develop an index for professional investors to track [bitcoin](https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin) when it launched the [XBX Index](https://tradeblock.com/markets/index/xbx) in 2014. CoinDesk announced its [purchase](https://www.coindesk.com/coindesk-acquires-tradeblock-adding-indexes-and-pricing-to-news-events-offerings) of TradeBlock for an undisclosed sum in January.

The new index joins a growing list of offerings designed to help investors track prices for DeFi tokens and invest in them. Last month, the technology firm Amun [launched](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/06/25/2253105/0/en/Amun-Launches-Two-New-index-Tokens-To-Simplify-Access-To-The-Ethereum-DeFi-Ecosystem.html) two new crypto token products, the DeFi Index Token and DeFi Momentum Index.¬†¬†¬†¬†

The cryptocurrency data firm Messari has a dedicated screening tool tracking 164 DeFi tokens. The average price of the tokens is up 395% this year, versus 8.3% for bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market value, and 160% for No. 2 [ether](https://www.coindesk.com/price/ethereum).¬†¬†

According to the press release, the CoinDesk DeFi index aims to provide a ‚Äúbroad-based, benchmark representation of DeFi protocols,‚Äù with assets [weighted](https://tradeblock.com/markets/dfx/) by their market capitalization.

As of July 1, 2021, the CoinDesk DeFi Index consisted of the following assets, with their market-capitalization-based weightings:

one of problems with BTC is power outages, with old electericity powerplants, and huge amount of power needed for minig there are country wide outages which make all Iranian angry so to calm down these masses they shout down crypto mining farms( most of them are privete not Government owned), most of news about these farming are small farming owned by individuals. (they had never shown that they destroyed mining computers in state media)
Even Iran government put rewards for selling out these small farming, but there are government farming facilities which are untouched.
Then regime next move and politics is to own all cryptoes market and has full control on it so Crypto exchanges are in way so they crack down exchanges inside Iran. ( only one major exchange has already been shout down others are working well and it is strange.)
On the other hand, they pass a law to legalize cryptoes. after that they licensed bunch of government owned farm to legalized their farming. so the remaing farms are now without any problem can farm. 

All in all the main objective of Iran regime is curve sanction and for doing it they want to own all cryptoes activities in Iran, so they hunt and ban private cryptoes farming or exchanges and allow their owned farming to work instead.

These are some headlines from Iran government about cryptoes:

1- 14.01.2021, Iranian-Chinese bitcoin farm shut amid power outages.
2- 12 Mar 2021, Bitcoin backlash: Iran cracks down on crypto exchanges.

CryptoCurrency,"I'm an amateur coder and I made two paper trade bots, working on them over the course of 2-3 years. I went quite deep and success was varying. I'll eventually upload the second one, but here's what I learned so far. 

There are two styles: 1) TA-focused single asset non-margin and 2) portfolio rebalance style. The first I'm probably permanently abandoning, and the second I will experiment more with. I might upload the rebalance once I learn github. Also if you're selling and reinvesting hundreds of times a year you might end up with ridiculous taxes, but a few dozen trades seems okay.

**\-\-TA-Focused Single Asset\-\-**
Abandoned route. This was based on 30min candlesticks and was not consistently profitable. I also included 1day candlesticks, Fear and Greed Index, average Bitcoin blockchain transactions, all which supplemental data in addition to the 30min. The main problem I found was that market conditions changed faster than my ability to test. From the Barts of last year, to bull run, to now. That's a fair amount of change every few months. Data analysts could probably make something to analyze shit in a faster way.

Indicators used included Directional Movement, Choppiness Index, Volume Oscillator, FRAMA. TA is pretty controversial for this type of short term trading, so I figured going deeper into the rabbit hole was the way to go. I also went with a signal count + signal strength approach. For example, DI and CI might give a buy signal and 1day candlestick data gives signal strength. If signal count and signal strength are both high enough, it buys.

Experimented with shorts for a bit too, but no thanks. I also experimented with manual day trading to see if I could learn something for the bot. BAD IDEA.

Note: incrediblecharts.com has good info on indicators with formulas and all. The DI formula is incomplete though.

**\-\-Rebalance with Secondary TA\-\-**
This is currently running with two modes: dump and noDump. Both are about 5-6% better than pure holding (instance started in late March '21, **Starting**: $1000. **Bot**:$912, **Hodl**:$858). Dump mode was created during the Barts of last year, when the chart would look like Bart Simpson. When a sharp drop in price was detected it dumps the entire asset and rebuys when it looks okay.

It uses a stable coin reserve as the last asset in the portfolio. Each asset is examined one by one to see if it requires a trade. If signaled it buys from the stable coin reserve or sells into the stable coin reserve. Imo this is better than a true rebalance where it rebalances the whole fucking portfolio if only one thing is unusually volatile.

Selling/buying is considered at 0.3% deviation in portfolio makeup. So if Bitcoin was 10% of your portfolio, and it goes up 30%, then it sells. If MATIC were 5% of your portfolio then it would need to go up 60% to sell. This is deliberate because smaller cap coins are more volatile. It's configured to rebalance based on price relative to the moving average (specifically FRAMA, because I already coded in the formula so why not). TA still has a place imo, but in this case it's quite secondary.

A paper bot of this type is not very hard so I encourage you to try if interested. Emphasis on **paper trade**. Binance API is more convenient for back data than Kraken. Kraken only gives 720 entries per candlestick call (so 2 weeks of 30min candlesticks, &gt;2 years for 1day candlesticks).

**\-\-Conclusions and Next Project\-\-**
It's hard to take the plunge into this with real money and the market changes fast. Even the second method can be improved with better data analysis imo. Also pure hodl is hard to beat at the moment, though that might change.

My next project is a simpler DCA in and DCA out simulation inspired by Benjamin Cowen's videos on his Risk Metric. Probably something more accessible like RSI based.",What I learned from 2-3 years paper trade bot experiment,1626714469
CryptoCurrency,"Don't get me wrong, I have bought BTC and ETH during this prolonged bleeding crab. I am comfortable buying those because they are staples and don't bleed as hard in dips.

But have any of you used this opportunity to buy into something different that you have had your eye on or thought was interesting? Or maybe just using this time to average down on stuff with a higher average cost?

For me, I bought into DOT for the first time. Polkadot's ability to do cross-blockchain transfers for any type of data or asset while aiming to achieve high levels of security and scalability seemed very interesting to me. 

Have also used this time to average down on my higher average priced bags that I still believe will be important in the crypto space (such as LINK).

CryptoCurrency,"Hello,

art cult leader here seeking some theoretical guidance. So let's say I've amassed a collective of talented and up and coming artists hell bent on making the world weirder. Here's what I'm thinking, tell me if this is stupid.

As part of our cult initiation program, we put candidates through a crypto literacy program. Get them setup with wallets, tips on safely storing, and how to transact . A portion of each transaction goes into a sort of shared crypto investment account. We use smart contracts to pay out a percentage of any growth automatically (each participant paid a relative % based on how much they've put into the pot) when it hits a certain percentage of growth. Basically like rewards on a credit card, except there's no limits on number of payouts.

There's two reasons I like this concept. 1: It sort of codifies our ethos of ""We all do better when we all do better"" and 2: It essentially makes us our own bank without adding any operational overhead.

Bitcoin has rarely left the 30k-40k range (which is big, sure, but still), other coins also moved within specific ranges.

For some reason though, people seem to have lost their memories in this time. Every time the market turns green after a single red day, hundreds of comments in the daily thread are something like ""is that.... green? I can't believe it, I haven't seen green in months!""

Well. For some reason this bugs me.

It is, of course, nonsense. I looked at the 1 day candles on Binance. Just to be clear, they are green if the respective coin moved up in the 24 hour interval, and red if it moved down. It doesn't matter how much. So this is not really a great indicator of which direction the market moves for a longer period of time (because, sure, on a single green day it might move up as much as it went down in 3 red days before that), but for how often it goes up and down in a specific time frame.

Not including today, Bitcoin had green candles on 29 days, red candles on 31. Almost exactly every second day is green. The longest red period was 5 days in a row, the longest green period 3 days.

*""but what about alts? sure, BTC did okay, but alts got murdered since then and there barely have been green days!!""*

Well, not really. I looked at the rest of the top 10 (excluding stable coins),

BCH 29/31  
BNB, ADA, DOT and UNI 28/32  
XRP 27/33  
LTC 25/35   
DOGE 23/37

So most of them had roughly 50% green days, and even DOGE, which performed worst, had close to 40%. Which means it is never surprising to see a green day. I am not saying we are in a bull market. I am not saying we are in a bear market. I have no idea what will happen. But don't pretend you haven't seen green in months. Thank you!","Today looks like a pretty red day.

Hello everyone,

I've been doing a bit of research about Energy Web Chain and about their first Dex that was implemented: Carbonswap.

I will share the information I've gathered so far, and I am curious to see what the community thinks about it.

I believe these two projects really do have strong fundamentals.

Energy Web Chain was co-founded by Rocky Mountain Institute and Grid Singularity.

Rocky Mountain Institute:

\&gt;https://energyweb.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/EWF/pages/717881446/Proof+of+Authority+Consensus

The Validators are big Energy Companies.

\&gt;https://validators.energyweb.org/

Allows for greater scaling than Ethereum since it already accounts that millions/billions of devices will use the chain frequently.

These are all the energy companies already part of the energy web chain ecosystem that will implement the blockchain use.

Now let's get to the interesting part.

Other use cases involve the selling of Carbon Credits. This would be done through a dex.

The first dex to deploy on EWC is Carbonswap, which has been working together with the EWC team in the last months.

CryptoCurrency,"First off, I'm not a financial advisor and this is just my opinion.

So right now we have no idea if we are in a Wyckoff, if we were and broke out of it, if we are now in a bear (down) market, or what. But it is obvious for a while now we are flat lining and it's staying a path. Here is a quick chart I made (note the channel in the chart)

[https://www.tradingview.com/x/ADloVv9T](https://www.tradingview.com/x/ADloVv9T)

This shows a possible method for BTC to get to $20k, but at the current rate it will take all the way towards oct for that to happen. IMO because it's that far out it most likely won't happen and chances are if we hit $30k the pattern will change. But that isn't the point of this post.

Because we are in uncertain time IMO DCA is the right move here.

&amp;#x200B;

For those who don't know what DCA is. Lets say you want to buy $1000 worth of BTC. Instead of buying it all at once and risking the thing going down even more which would cause a big lost. You can simply do it 1 of 2 ways.

1. You could break the $1k up and say every day or every week at the same time you will buy. So lets say you split it up into 10 days. Then for $100 every day you will buy BTC at whatever price it is selling at. Even if the price does go down this works out because it averages the cost between all the buys and that is your base price.
2. You could break it up by %. So lets say you broke the $1k by 10%, then this means for every % BTC drops you put in another $100. This can be done with basic tools on many exchanges so it will automatically do this. You would just have to setup each buy manually and let the tool do it's thing. Same as above, your base price will reflect the average between them all.

The advantage of 2 IMO is it could easily go up after a given point and this would mean instead of increasing the base price, you kept it low. The down side is the amount of BTC is lower so if there is a moment that it does skyrocket then you lose out on that.

Long-term holders and bull market HODLers appear unshaken by volatility and lower prices. The volume of coins held in illiquid state continues to grow, and the potential supply squeeze is coming from a much higher base than the 2018-19 bear.

I contacted support and they requested ID verification requiring me to send them a picture of my drivers license and a picture of myself.

However, even with that approval, my deposit is taking SO LONG.  I'm waiting on my fourth business day for a deposit.  I contacted them again and asked them if this was the new norm.  They told me with a positive account history, the deposit wait times will be shorter and shorter.

Help!

I've found a token that I think is a hidden gem but it's been really slow in uptake....I'm trying to understand why as it seems like a really solid project with a brilliant Dev team.....

WifeCoin (I know, don't laugh:) is the token I'm talking about. It's a fairly new depreciative token that utilises tokenomics where 4% of all transactions are redistributed to holders and 1% is burned.

It started out with 100T supply and half of this was burned on launch.

It has a really solid doxxed dev team and they supply AMA's via Youtube etc and are approachable on Linkedin.

Only 1453 holders as of this moment and it's dirt cheap right now too.

They have multiple developments in the works such as (Wife) swapping, staking and yield farming. 

I thought that this would fly (have to admit that I loved the idea) but I just can't see why it's stalling at the moment. Maybe it's the name but that's part of the reason that I thought it would do well....doesn't everyone have a Wife/sister/daughter or niece that would like some crypto in their lives?

CryptoCurrency,"Let me say this first, this is about building more coins over a long term. If you're looking to make a quick buck this not it.

So I've been messing around with Algo and the Yldy no loss lottery and I gotta say, I'm digging it.

First, you got the Algo on Algorand Wallet with passive Staking building a reward pool that cashes out anytime you make a transaction to or from your account. 

Then, you got YLDY with the Yieldy no loss lottery where you stake Algo for weekly lottery tickets and gain YLDY rewards daily. You can choose to claim, or continue to stake the YLDY to accumulate from the prize pools. After the weekly, keeping your Algo staked continues into the next drawing.

So with a split of Algo passive staked on the Algorand wallet and Algo staked on the Yieldy generating YLDY and letting the rewards compound, you are generating the most coins you can daily.

If I'm wrong about any of this please say something. I found it to be a fun way to passively generate coin and stop freaking out about price fluctuations.

CryptoCurrency,"So there is a common misconception in crypto - people expect prices to go high when projects burn their tokens - this rarely happens. Also many scamcoins are based on this fact.

However price is a simple dynamic from buys and sells. The current price just represents how high buyers would go and how low sellers would go. The available supply can shift this as well as many other psychological factors.

When the creators of a token burn it to hell, they take the coins from their own supply - A supply which was in most cases never available to the market, so this process is nearly independent from the price - it could only have an effect as the news itself.

The most important and ironic detail is, that if this supply would have hit the market (creators taking profits), the price would go down as the available supply would rise. So theses coins are not burnt to increase the price, actually they need to be burned in order for the price NOT to go down.",Why burning coins does not increase the price,1626710597
CryptoCurrency,"So I started investing in crypto in April, and the most I've had to spend is about 200 bucks each month (the coming months due to life I might afford more, or way less), and I've just been buying bitcoin for that amount on Binance each month and then exchanged to whatever else I want from there.

But with how volatile crypto is I've been wondering if maybe I've been better served transfering the monthly amount to Binance and doling it out once a week/day, or would the amount be too small to make it worth it? 50 bucks a week seems reasonable but I'm guessing 7 bucks a day could be a bit silly.","Should I DCA every month, every week, or every day?",1626710595

# What‚Äôs Dogecoin, and How does it Work?

The cryptocurrency, which originated as a joke, has surpassed all others in terms of hype over the past year. Ironically, it seems to be quite sensitive to jokes, as evidenced by Ilon Musk‚Äôs humorous comments. The Dogecoin cryptocurrency was created in December 2013 by Billy Marcus, a programmer, and former IBM engineer. At the time, Bitcoin was getting a very bad reputation for involvement in black market transactions on the darknet, and Marcus wanted to create an alternative that had nothing to do with such dubious problems. The cryptocurrency‚Äôs name came from a meme and the image of a dog is used in the images it is illustrated with.

# So, What‚Äôs the Difference?

Despite this, events show us that SHIB is trying very hard to stand out and show that it can have real use and be profitable without relying solely on memes. So, as far as advanced, the value of Dogecoin has grown incredibly in the past year, especially thanks to the support of celebrities like Ilon Musk and the acceptance of it by the community, which has made it one of the most popular tokens, which is now ranked nth.

I'm trying to do some research, partially for myself and partially for an Executive MBA to try and sort out a few things that I think you all may be able to help me out with.  I'm personally interested in the market dynamics.

*Full Disclosure: As far as being a Crypto person, I invested like $75 in BTC, LTC and DOGE via Celery in 2015 and have used that to watch the market.  After a series of moves it's now all 1.6 ETH locked up in Staking.  I'm not a heavy investor/trader but do see potential future value after these initial swings/shocks settle down.*

*Bonus: My DOGE would have been worth \~$85K at its peak with a basis price of 23.99 net fees from celery.  I sold it in 2017 for $1,400ish and still consider it one of the most lucrative investments I've ever made on a percentage basis.*

I have some questions for data and potential input from the crowd:

* Does anyone have a good estimate of how many real dollars are in the market?  
   * Theoretical values are high but we have some risk via Tether that are in the legal spotlight
   * Outside of Stablecoins, how much actual cash is held on exchanges?
   * What other reservoirs are there?
* Who are the overlapping points where crypto-volatility may force sell-offs in the normie finance world?  Yes publicly traded crypto firms are going to get their faces ripped off in the case of a big event, but I'm focused on less easily predicted ones.
   * Are High Frequency Traders/Low Latency Traders the greatest risk here?
   * Are there hedge funds with a high risk of arbitrage divergence based on some unforeseeable fall out of crypto?

All you need is to be able to tokenize positions - so be a dev at Mirror, SNX or Binance. So you opened a 3x long position - that's 3x leverage. But since you have all the great tools you can lock this position and issue tokens representing those positions - let's call it BTCBULL. This is all fine and dandy and now you have a 3x leveraged token. But that won't wreck anyone nearly fast enough for good entertainment, so let's put them on an exchange that allows .. you guessed it, leverage trading!

So you 3x long your BTCBULL position which should result in nice x9 leverage. So you have that position ... but also have all the tools to tokenize positions... so let's do it, now you have a tokenized 3x long position on a BTCBULL (3x leverage) token. So let's tokenize this x9 position into BTCPERMABULL and release for trading.

Long.

... (x however much you want)

Do it 10 times and you end up with every degen trader's dream - 3486784401x leverage, tokenized into one single token - BIGDICKBTCPERMABULL

If you keep doing it, in the end you get a token that gets wrecked in infinitesimally short amount of time, but to be discrete let's say you can get wrecked in Planck time. Each underlying, compounding position liquidates the next, basically creating a cascading avalanche of wreckage almost instantly bringing your token to 0.

About 14% of people have invested in cryptocurrencies. The most common access point is crypto brokers, followed by CC exchanges, and the least common way is through banks.

In the future, an additional 17% will potentially invest in CCs. But a 10% does not know how to do so.

As obstacles for future investments are seen: high volatility (46%), doubts about safekeeping (40%), and regulatory uncertainties (38%).

Regarding CCs as an assets class, over 30% deem them a suitable form of investment. Over 80% see gold as a suitable asset, 65% see stocks favorably, and about 58% see fiat money as a good investment.

CryptoCurrency,"TL;DR When mining in a pool you receive shares that are displayed as decimal faction of a token, when that decimal fraction reaches 1.0 is it actually worth the same as a real token?  for example Etherium seems to be fluctuating around $2000 per token, if I mine in a pool and I get to 1.0 ETH in my account is that worth the approx. $2000 that an ACTUAL token is worth?  

So I got interested in Crypto, mostly in Etherium, I saw that it was worth something around $2000, after doing some research I found out that with my GPU I could mine about 1 Etherium a month (give or take a week or so) I thought ""That's almost what make at my day job, doubling my income would be nice.""  so I learned a bit more, watched some Youtube videos that made it look really easy and then I thought ""It can't be that easy can it?  I can just Make double money?  With no real effort?""  of course not.  everyone keeps saying ""I'm making $150 dollars a day passive income."" or some other similar statement.  I don't care, I want to earn a token and sell that token for the value of that token.  If Etherium is worth $2000 (I know right now its around $1800, but it fluctuates and I'm just averaging it... kinda) I want to mine an Etherium token and then sell that token for $2000.  but nobody is talking about how to do that which is making me think it's not normally done.

So I then found out that all this easy mining stuff is actually mining through a pool, so a whole lot people are all working together to mine the currency and the pool takes home the pot, then splits it among everyone, equally or by contribution depending on the pool I guess.  I don't really understand all the payment methods and what exactly they are doing (please don't try to tell me, I will find a tutorial that I understand eventually, but for now its a lot of complex jargon to me).  but I DO understand that a pool divvies out shares, and a share is represented by a decimal fraction OF a token, e.g. 0.23487 ETH which is approximately 2/10 of one Etherium.  but these shares are officially worth nothing I'm told, they are just a numerical representation for accounting purposes.  so if my 2/10 of an Etherium are worth nothing then when I get to 1.0 Etherium is it suddenly worth something?  As I understand it I do not own an Etherium token, I own a bajillion bits of a bajillion tokens that are basically worthless.  like if I shaved a small bit of a bunch of one 1oz gold coins until I eventually had an once of gold shavings, sure it's 1oz of gold, but it's not gold bullion.  SO, do I like exchange my bajillion bits for an ACTUAL token?  I do know that tokens have codes associated with each individual one so that it can be confirmed that that token is the only one of that token and it is owned specifically by a certain person or company.  Is my 1.0 ETH in my mining pool actually worth the same as a ""Real"" Etherium Token?  can I sell that 1.0 ETH for (approx.) $2000?  that is my question and I cannot seem to find anyone on the internet willing to answer it.  (I literally made a reddit account just for this, because I CANT RELY ON GOOGLE OR YOUTUBE OR ANYONE ELSE APPARENTLY!).  help me reddit, you're my only hope.","No one seems to be answering this question, about pool mining, am I just overthinking things?",1626707441

CryptoCurrency,"Let me start by telling you, back in 2016 I jumped in the weedstock frenzy, I bought Canopy, Metrum Aphria and some other stocks only to experience a slow bleed that brought me down to 80% in matter of WEEKS.
It was tough, but I held on, brought my average down via dollar cost averaging and held my positions. I kept doing DD on the companies I invested in to keep track and to remind me why I invested in the first place and also to keep my confidence up. What I did to keep my mind off things, first I uninstalled Yahoo finance and stopped looking at charts every 10 minutes, found hobbies to do etc. Months passed by and then tide slowly turned around, my averages started getting out of minuses to go in the green, and in a matter of a few years my -80% averages were 500% 800% 1000% in the green. I was glad I held into what I believed in. Sure there were a few crashes and slow bleeds after that, but in the end the most important thing was that I didn't panic, kept doing my researches and stayed confident in my investments.


We are coming out of a year and half of pandemic, lock downs etc. Borders are opening up again, Tourism and travelling is slowly starting back again,  people have been staying home, working from home, stacking money on the side and investing in crypto/stock market, we experienced a big crash in feb/march 2020 only to recover everything in just a few months and markets/Crypto hitting ALL TIMES HIGH.

This idea of loving each other as if we are in a sweaty nightclub, also brought me to the second point i am about to make.

I wanted to introduce a concept to you guys called ""collective Efficacy"", defined as  the ability of members of a community to control the behavior of individuals and groups in the community.

&gt;""Communities with high levels of social ties, where neighbours look out for each other have lower rates of crime and a higher rate of safety. Those communities that experience high levels of population decline, as well as those where most of the residents belong to social groups that possess a smaller share of the resources available in society, are less likely to develop a sufficient level of collective efficacy to significantly prevent or reduce crime. Since developing mutual trust and cooperation with neighbors requires time, those communities where individuals are more likely to move out (transient population) have lower levels of collective efficacy. In communities more seriously affected by residential instability, social bonds between residents are weaker, meaning that they will be less likely to cooperate in monitoring the behavior of others""

Similarly I believe the future of this sub relies on our conscious efforts to increase the collective efficacy of this sub. I wont list out the myriad of problems that I think are with this sub, but alot of them can be discouraged if we look out for each other.I do hope that we as neighbours can deepen our ties despite the anonymity of the internet.

CryptoCurrency,"Safemoon.

I‚Äôll begin by saying I‚Äôm not here to ‚Äúshill‚Äù nor promote Safemoon, nor will I ever. I believe if one wants to invest, they will do it on their own intuition. This, however, is meant to be an open discourse about the token (future coin) in itself.

Every single day, I scroll the r/cryptocurrency subreddit page and find countless comments about Safemoon accompanied by swarms of downvotes and tens if not hundreds of follow-on comments that say, essentially, nothing more than ‚Äúscam‚Äù, ‚ÄúPonzi‚Äù, ‚ÄúiT dOeSn‚ÄôT hAvE aNy uTiLiTy‚Äù, etc. as well as people asking legitimate questions like: ‚ÄúWhy or how exactly are you labeling SFM as this or that?‚Äù To which there are no helpful responses. Simply‚Ä¶ ‚Äúyou tell me why it isn‚Äôt a scam.‚Äù 

So.

Where is the bar set for utility? People are so scared of change and adaptation; it might ruin their little pet project. Give me a break. The incredible thing about cryptocurrency is every project can live in the crypto ecosystem simultaneously.

Since your question (rhetorical) is ‚ÄúWhy do you guys buy those?‚Äù, I‚Äôll offer my answer: Safemoon.

I‚Äôll be the first to admit that I my initial investment into Safemoon was purely hype driven. I‚Äôd never considered investing in cryptocurrency, figured I‚Äôd missed the boat, thought it was too complicated, a whole list of reasons. What got me was the noise, in multiple facets, people who aren‚Äôt crypto people. Not shillers, not paid promoters. I recall the moment exactly. I was watching Timthetetman‚Äôs twitch stream and his chat for weeks suggested buying Safemoon. He repeatedly said it was too difficult to buy, he was too dumb, etc. So I thought to myself.. hmm.. I‚Äôm not dumb, let me give it a try. In a matter of 20 or so minutes, I went from never having considered buying crypto to owning some Safemoon. Mind you, I still didn‚Äôt even know what it was.

This was right before the big bull push. Within a few days, I had almost 10x‚Äôd my investment. My mind was blown. ‚ÄúHoly crap?! Why haven‚Äôt I been in crypto for longer?? How could I have turned down these opportunities!?‚Äù We all know what happens next. The entire crypto market took a nosedive. (Important to note: at the time, I didn‚Äôt realize it was the entire market) I was still up, but by a small margin. This prompted me to become the biggest Safemoon fudder on Reddit. I had the infamous ‚ÄúHow to make money in crypto‚Äù post outlining that all it took was to create a unique token that had catchy words, phrases, heavily market it, pump the price, sell, repeat. The repercussion of my actions was a swift ban from the Safemoon subreddit, obviously, and understandably.

Then something happened. I watched that week‚Äôs AMA. I joined the discord channel. I took a deep dive into researching the roadmap, it‚Äôs possible utility, it‚Äôs niche in the cryptocurrency marketplace. Since my research, I‚Äôve more than 10x‚Äôd my initial investment and will continue to until I reach my goal bag size.

Why I‚Äôm bullish on Safemoon‚Äôs future and a few tidbits I feel can bring some conversation to the table:

1.	‚Å†Multi-chain bridge‚Äôs allowing utilization in just about every sector.
2.	‚Å†Wallet (currently in closed beta testing) said to have the best encryption/security on the market.
3.	‚Å†Exchange with tokenomic implementation, first of its kind in the crypto space, meaning if I hold ETH, Doge, BNB, etc I will receive reflections for holding that coin/token. (Read: a la stock market compounding interest as an auto staking mechanism without having to stake yourself) Also said to be able to process more than 3,000 simultaneous transactions.
4.	‚Å†Blockchain being built with hints that it could be based off the IOTA Tangle network (speculation, not outright confirmed as of yet) as opposed to your standard ‚Äúblockchain‚Äù, meaning faster transaction times, stronger encryption, more reliable network, lower transaction fees.
5.	‚Å†Cold wallet release said to be end of summer this year. Earlier in the year, Ledger published a FUD article about Safemoon and the likes. What did the team do? Very next AMA said they‚Äôve taken matters into their own hands and we‚Äôre building our own cold wallet as competition while also filing a lawsuit against Ledger.
6.	‚Å†Gambian project/Project Pheonix. Yeah yeah, I know. Same ole song and dance. ‚ÄúEveryone is trying to go to Africa‚Äù, ‚Äúthat‚Äôs just all hype and promise and no product‚Äù‚Ä¶ I get it. The team has kept this one extremely close to chest and tight lipped. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôve put it so far down on the list. It is extremely mysterious and secretive, likely by nature and NDA as the team is in talks with literal national governments. We‚Äôll see how this one pans out. Color me‚Ä¶ cautiously optimistic.
7.	‚Å†Debit card. The only reason I put this here is because the ‚Äúmarket‚Äù wants to see a use case (ie a way to spend your crypto) and this is it. The debit card will be excluded from the notorious 10% tax, thus allowing it to be used in a transactional nature. This doesn‚Äôt mean anything to me personally as I (like I would imagine majority of the market, despite what you might say) have no intention on spending my crypto on pizza, crypto is an investment to me, not a utility. Alas, to each their own.
8.	‚Å†Thomas Smith. Papa has been in the crypto space since Bitcoin. He has stated countless times he was in the chats during the original Satoshi days and has been a student and steward of the game ever since. He turned down a multi-million dollar offer from XRP and took the keys to the Safemoon project instead. He is about as pure as it comes in the idea of what cryptocurrency should and was always intended to be. On top of this, Papa is absolutely incredible at what he does as a developer. If Safemoon is to succeed, aside from the community itself, it will be on the backs of Papa and his team.
9. Video game implementation, application. I‚Äôll be honest, my gaming experience is essentially Fortnite, COD, and the occasional Pok√©mon for nostalgia purposes.  Because of this, I can‚Äôt really dive into the benefits of video game integration.

Those are a list of hard confirmations in the pipeline and personal sentiment. Other, speculative items on the agenda that have been alluded to but not outright confirmed or denied are satellite/telecom integrations, branching to other African/international countries/applications, NFT‚Äôs (and save me the ‚Äúeveryone is doing NFT‚Äôs‚Äù essay), and there are more I can‚Äôt think of off the top of my head. Again, speculative in nature. However, it seems with every speculative piece of information we‚Äôve received from the team, most of it end up coming to fruition.

FUD and concerns I‚Äôve combed through in just about every Safemoon post in the CC and CryptoMoonshots subs:

1.	‚Å†It‚Äôs a Ponzi scheme - Here‚Äôs a wake up call buttercup. Have you ever heard of.. wait for it.. investing? Maybe you‚Äôve heard of Bitcoin. Or Microsoft. Or Amazon. Maybe Apple? Early investors will always reap the most reward no matter the product or company. $1,000 invested at Amazon‚Äôs IPO is worth ~$2.4m today whereas if you were to invest $1,000 today, you wouldn‚Äôt be able to buy one share. Does that make Amazon a Ponzi scheme because early adapters reap the most reward? $1,000 in Bitcoin at ATL of ~ $0.0008 would net you ~ $81B at ATH. I don‚Äôt have to do the math for you any longer to make my point that early investors benefit the most. That‚Äôs how the market works. With that being said, for the MLM aspect, I could buy 25B Safemoon right now and start earning more reflections than someone who bought 5B three months ago. So how does that play into the entire ‚ÄúPonzi‚Äù game?

2.	‚Å†Rugpull - If I had a dollar for every comment I‚Äôve read about ‚Äúthe Safemoon rugpull is coming and it‚Äôs gonna wreck so many innocent investors‚Äù‚Ä¶ enough already. Seriously. In what world do you live in where a company with projects in the pipeline, a fully doxxed team, international government relations, etc is going to rugpull? Wouldn‚Äôt that have happened 4 months ago? It literally can‚Äôt. Liquidity is locked. And for those saying ‚Äúyeah man they‚Äôre definitely gonna pull the rug when the liquidity unlocks in 4 years.‚Äù You literally can‚Äôt be serious and you look like a complete clown with suggestions like that. With all of that being said, two people on the core team have a stake in Safemoon: SafemoonDev and Hank our CTO. SafemoonDev (the creator of Safemoon) has stated that his wallet (deployer wallet) is used to fund the project. Read: pay employees, fund business expenses, etc. As for Hank‚Äôs wallet, who cares? Aside from these two, the community set up a donation wallet for our CBO Thomas who has stated he doesn‚Äôt own or want to own any as to not cloud his judgement and work ethic in a project he is passionate about. He has also stated he has zero intention of ever cashing out anything in the donation wallet.

3.	‚Å†All hype, no product. I don‚Äôt know what to say to this. Honestly. Safemoon is four months old. Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc maxies expect every single new token/coin to release a polished final product one week into their roadmap. That‚Äôs not how it works. Apple was around for 30 years before it ever released the iPhone in 2007. (Save the speech, I know Apple had other products well before that). Tesla was founded in 2003 and didn‚Äôt produce it‚Äôs first car until 2008 and now has a market cap of more than $600B, higher than every other car manufacturer combined.

4.	‚Å†Adoption. This one doesn‚Äôt make any sense. Just because YOU don‚Äôt want to buy Safemoon doesn‚Äôt mean people aren‚Äôt. With nearly 2.5 million holders, I‚Äôd hardly say people aren‚Äôt interested.

There‚Äôs so much unfounded hatred towards Safemoon. Reddit is an echo chamber of people drooling on themselves while typing hate messages on a forum because the hip and cool thing to do is hate on a company/project that is genuinely attempting to revolutionize the crypto space. You don‚Äôt see the Safemoon community in here pissing all over the Ethereum network or Bitcoin. Why must y‚Äôall do it to us?

Now that I‚Äôve given entirely too much energy to put some of this FUD to rest, where have I gone wrong? Where have I been led astray? What have I missed? Any intuitive insight or outsider perspective from someone besides the crowd that just knowwws Safemoon is a scam?

CryptoCurrency,"Hello, dear people, 

I'm interested in the most efficient ways and solutions to stake Ether as of now, Q3 2021 and I think this is a subject which would be interesting for many other people as well. 

My current situation - I'm able to provide the 32ETH required to run my own validator node, but I'm not sure the trouble to maintain it is worth it, so I'm looking for alternative solutions. Ideally, they wouldn't require a total lock of the ETH, but if locking it up would provide better yields for some reason, I might consider it. Besides, if there's an option to stake using my Ledger Nano and still maintain total control of the funds, that would be great. 

I've currently explored Kraken (they do require locking up and they maintain the ETH on their website), lido, which has a bit of a better yield and also guarda wallet, which seems as a very decent balance between all of the above.

CryptoCurrency,"So I have plenty of different crypto in my Trustwallet and my question is, what is the best way to get the crypto out of the wallet and into USD for the least possible charges?

For example, I know changing, let's say Safemoon into USDC would take up some transaction fees including Safemoon's own inherent fees. And then I have to transfer out USDC to a crypto market that supports selling into USDC like Coinbase, Binance and Kraken, which is a hit of transfer fees and then finally sell the USDC on Coinbase, Binance or Kraken which in turn has more fees.

From my understanding, USDC is actually expensive for fees because it's on the Etherium network so maybe BNB is cheaper but then I hear Tron (Trx) is even cheaper.

I'm worried that as crypto ETFs gain in popularity, Gemini will have a bigger and bigger target painted on its back - how confident can we be in their ability to safeguard their crypto?

CryptoCurrency,"Hey friends! First up, I would like to mention that majority of your bitcoin should be in a cold hardware wallet and NOT in the following methods which will earn you passive income. However, if you would like to earn some passive income using bitcoin/crypto currency and are accepting of the risks.  I made a [video](https://youtu.be/WrWIt71vlsU) explaining how to. I always wished to be able to live off my crypto and I have finally reached that point, I hope to be able to help you in your journey as well. If you like to read instead, then I have written a guide here. Nevertheless, please take good care of yourself in this current climate :)

 1. Lending Platforms 

Lending platforms are lending services that offer deposits and loans on both centralised and decentralised platforms. Essentially, as a crypto holder, you will deposit your crypto onto these platforms and earn an interest on those crypto funds that you deposited. It's pretty similar to how a bank works. These services will hold our crypto and lend it out in order to generate interest  and this interest is then paid back to us on a regular or even daily basis. With most lending platforms, you do not have to deposit your cryptocurrency for a fixed period of time, in fact you have access to your funds at any point in time should you require to utilise your crypto. In addition,  many of these platforms provide insurance to the funds that you deposit making it one of the safest ways to make passive income. To sum it up, the beauty of lending platforms are that they allow your money to compound daily with minimal risk whilst giving you 24/7 access to your crypto funds.  

 2. Staking Coins Coin staking is the action of staking your coins in order to help maintain the decentralised consensus on proof of stake blockchains. It's kind of like being a miner in a POW blockchain such as bitcoin. But in bitcoin - miners compete with their computing power, in proof of stake block chains - people compete with the amount of coins they stake. The more coins one stake, the higher the probability of being chosen to validate a node. When you stake a coin, you earn a a decent return of your coin in kind and you also help to secure the network of the coin you are bullish on. There are a number of things you have to consider: 

\- Wallet Support - Staking complexity - Duration of lockup  - Staking returns

 Different coins have different staking parameters. 

  3.Liquidity Mining/Yield Farming Liquidity mining It is the practice of supplying liquidity to a protocol which is then used in order to facilitate the decentralised exchange of different assets. The transaction fees exchange users pay in exchanging the two coins is then distributed among liquidity providers based on the proportion of liquidity they provide. Some examples of such DEXES are Uniswap and Sushiswap. However, the risk of liquidity mining is impermanent loss. Impermanent loss is the quantified opportunity cost of providing liquidity should one of the tokens become volatile in price.  For Yield Farming I recommend Yearn finance - an app which automates the process by sending your crypto currency to different platforms in order to earn the highest return possible. The risk is that your funds are being moved in yearn vaults and pools may be exploited.",Hey friends!

CryptoCurrency,"In addition to the main point in the title, I just want to clarify a couple of persistent misconceptions about Grayscale's products, prompted by DataDash's video today that contained some errors. I've been publishing information about this to my twitter at CryptoniteClark over the last few months, but haven't been able to dispel the myths.

GBTC shares should not be confused with the BTC held in the GBTC Trust Fund. When GBTC accredited (ie wealthy) investors buy GBTC shares, Grayscale buys the same amount of BTC and adds it to the Fund.

When Accredited GBTC investors invest, they have to wait 6 months before they receive their GBTC shares. For example, the large amount of shares that were bought during the 10 days starting 13th January, which is reflected as a sharp increase on the [Bybit Holdings](https://www.bybt.com/Grayscale#Holdings) chart, are being [unlocked](https://www.bybt.com/Grayscale#Unlock) now.  It's not that those investors are likely to sell, necessarily, because they'd be selling at a loss due to the [Premium discount](https://www.bybt.com/Grayscale#Premium) of ~12% under the BTC price. However, the people who were considering buying BTC now may find the GBTC share price more attractive due to that same discount.  The amount of spot BTC being traded will be reduced as a consequence, which will continue until the Premium returns to a healthy positive (say, +10% rather than -12%).

Once GBTC shares have been unlocked, they can be traded without restriction with non-accredited investors.

The BTC in the GBTC Fund are **NEVER** sold, with the following exception.  It's clear from the [Bybit Flows](https://www.bybt.com/Grayscale#Flows) chart that there are small daily deductions of BTC from the Fund of about ~36BTC per day. This is the admin fee, which equates to about 1.5% per year (although, the published amount is 2%). Even if Grayscale doesn't manage to acquire another customer in the next 49.5  years ((650,773BTC / 36) / 365), it will still be paid its millions of dollars per day in admin fee. It's even higher if you add up all its crypto funds.

Although more trivial, the other drawback of Grayscale products for regular BTC traders is that the more it accumulates, the less accurate on-chain analytics will be.","Grayscale has essentially put 3.1% (and increasing) of the BTC market in a walled garden. While GBTC is being traded, it reduces BTC activity. Those who were celebrating Grayscale for pumping the market on the run up can thank it for the recent dump and stagnation.",1626702548

CryptoCurrency,"Hi all.


Just wanted to share my story and a word of caution really on regards to why buying a lot of or perhaps going all in on a brand new DeFi platforms native token token, may not be the best idea. I've lost about 200 grand because of my choice, ile explain why.

For context I have been involved with cryptocurrency in some shape or form since around 2010 but really only started making actual monetary progress in 2015 where I rode the first Ethereum train into the DAO, watched it all split and hardfork and lost all my cash making the wrong decisions with DAO tokens, little did I know they would be later redeemable for ETH, my mistake.

Similarly in 2017 I experienced a similar situation where I absolutely killed it, this time with a few alt coins I was interested in, ended up with a lot more this time and things looked really good but as with many I lost a lot here too.


So I spent the next 3+ years DCAing my coins and ended up with a metric shitton of the ones I actually wanted. I started trading futures here too and smashed it, call it luck and deep obsession but I got out of it with a lot more than I bargained for.



Cool I'm nearly there after tax, just a waiting game now I have my bags ready to go.


Next I heard about the BalancedDAO DeFi platform on Icon network powered with ICX and moved my cash here to start yield farming the loan at stupidly high APR that has since levelled out as the new BALN token crashed endlessly from $70 to $14 over the next 30 days or so, during this time I sold all the BALN tokens I was farming as expected them to fall a lot, though by staking these newly minted tokens you can earn Network Fees from the platform. Don't get me wrong, I didn't get suckered in by the genesis APR rates, but I did pull in about $1600 a day for atleast the first week by taking loans out against ICX.

Based on this I always had it in my mind that I will sell them to death and then once they look to be cheap, ile go hard in and trade all my ICX for BALN and stake them, getting those tasty network fees.


When the time was right (IT WASNT) I went almost all in and purchased tons of these bad boy passive earning tokens at $14.50 as the inflation of 100K a day up to about 6 million tokens was due to halt to a crawl once the network fees were released not too soon afterwards. I'm thinking, finally now I can quit my job in maybe a year or two, now I can pay my small mortgage off once taxes are paid. This is what I've been looking for!!!!

I went so hard in to this I am amongst the top 40 wallets (was #10)


This token didn't stop falling, its still falling daily and its currently valued at about $1 and though I DID get 30% bump on my BALN stack from the first wave of fees, relative to what its all worth now it was not worth it at all. I'd say things were getting better but I've lost another 10 grand this week alone.

Mind you, I haven't sold and am receiving the fees so it's not a complete right off, its just that I worked hard for that money, its the same money I've been regurgitating since 2015, time and time again and my luck was finally at the end of its tether.


TLDR; Lost about $200K investing in a new DeFI platforms native token in its genesis inflation phase as thought the platform network fees would cover the loss from the falling price. It didn't, and it won't stop falling and now I probably need 1400% increase just to break even.",DeFi Tokens and General Safety regarding 'Genesis Dumps',1626701721

She's the one who introduced my parents to each other and she's been really the only extended family to make efforts to be in my life, so we've always been pretty close. She graduated from MIT and has worked in blockchain for years, so when she told me crypto would be a good investment, I listened. Put a little of my savings in ETH, BTC, and a few other alts, and eventually joined this subreddit because of her. If it wasn't for her encouragement I probably would have panic sold after all of my parents' fud. It's been an insane 6 months but I love the thrill of it, I believe in the technology, and I've gotten involved in a really awesome community. I'm really grateful and I hope she's reading this right now. I know the charts are a little rough, but you're weathering the storm like you always have.

After hopium-fueled dreams of becoming financially free fueled my millennial brain with coveted dopamine, I realized it‚Äôs not about me anymore.

It‚Äôs for my recently divorced father who‚Äôs stuck paying child support with no retirement. The company he worked at for 15 years folded and he‚Äôs left with nothing.

CryptoCurrency,"I don't really understand how people is more afraid to buy during corrections and dips than FOMOing in during ATH.

Arguably, the risk of buying at ATH is incredibly higher, since there's a room for a bigger downside, while if your buying a falling knife, your starting price point is incredibly lower. For example, right now.

Let's say you buy a BTC falling knife at 30k, and it dips further to 28k again. What's the risk? An 8% fall?

If we compare that to people buying alts at ATH, like ETH, XLM, DOT, ADA, MATIC or BNB, we've seen falls of more than 50% or 60% in every single one of these.

My invitation, which is not financial advice but instead a call to think about this with a cool head, is the following: If you FOMOed into crypto this year, and bought at or near ATH, right now is an amazing time to either buy at half prices and lower your entry prices through DCA, or alternatively, a great chance to buy a falling knife which is a much better decision risk-wise than FOMOing at ATH.

CryptoCurrency,"**A Hard Truth**

The next 6 months are going to be a wake up call for a lot of people in crypto and meme stocks 

The last 12 years since the 2008 crash have been a hyper investment period. Almost all sectors at one point entered a bubble. Crypto, energy, technology, healthcare, EVs etc....

Unfortunately the FED broke the money system last year and the party may be coming to an end. Crypto has seen the biggest jump in history backed by literally FOMO and nothing else 

Everyone made money bud. It wasn't your genius strategy. It was literally the easiest time to make money in the market in human history 

While I don't 100% agree with M. Burry; he is right that a major BTC correction is coming. DCA isn't going to work when 90% of crypto goes to $0 

ETH and BTC and maybe a few might survive the mega crash but BTC is now proofing out to $12,500.00. On almost all major models. On chain data suggesting a fair value of $10,000.00 from $20,000.00 in May 

A relief  rally with a max cap of $56,000.00 is still possible but the only model that supports that is Wyckoff and nothing else 

The trigger may be a -10% correction in the NASDAQ

When shit like SPCE jumps 40% because the founder said I'm going to space. You know the market it fucked 

GME, AMC, DOGE and TSLA have been the biggest warming signs in 20 years

It doesn't mean that there won't be money to be made but it's just going to be way harder. No more 50x gains on Dog coins and 10x on ghost chains that have no use function 

ICP was worth $700 and MINA a $187. They  are now $30 and $1.20. With the bottom being around $2 and $0.50

We all just need to put in the work and stop with the HODL and DCA memes. A lot of people are going to get REKT and its time this sub takes responsibility and educates people about how near the cliff we are",Repost: from 8 days ago,1626700368

As far as I understand there are three key components:

- Public Key

- Private Key
    - for signing transactions
- Seed Phrase
    - for recovery when Private Key is lost

The Internet tells me that a hardware wallet can store the Private key and sign transactions with it. It is protected by a pin code to prevent other people from using it. In case the hardware wallet is lost the Private Keys are lost too and I need to use the Seed Phrase to recover access to my wallet.

What I don't understand is why the above is so great. Why don't just grab two usb drives, encrypt them and store my Private Keys on drive A and my Seed Phrases on drive B? For the same 60+ Euro I can get a whole bunch of usb drives and store multiple back-ups in different places.

CryptoCurrency,"The super TL;DR here is ""Don't even bother""  

This isn't like gambling in the normal sense, the odds are so stacked against you it's almost past ""lottery winnings"" odds.

With Pump 'n' Dump groups, a lot of people don't realise the way they operate from the inside. But first, a discussion of how they look from the outside.  

Each Pump 'n' Dump group operates from the following premise:  

* Visible history of huge pumps that they lay claim to  
* Post history of members saying ""I made X profit!""  
* Locked or limited general chat (discord)  
* Timer for the next pump  
* Invite more members to be alerted to pumped coin sooner.  

So what happens is as a new shmuck, you join and you wait, they will announce that they will be performing a pump on an exchange (Binance) using a certain pair (BTC / USDT)  

The time comes and they say ""Coin is [DONK], buy now!""  

So you rush over to the [DONK/USDT] trading pair and you can see the price absolutely rocketing on the minute chart. You quickly market buy as much as you have in USDT and then wait to market sell.  

Maybe if you're *extremely* lucky, you make a small profit. But usually what happens is, the first minute candle is massive and green, and then these gigantic red candles come out of nowhere, decimating thousands of newbies positions on the way down and leaving thousands more as bagholders.  

**How does this happen?**  

To find that out, you need to look from the position of the owners and VIP's of the group.

* On the sly, buy [DONK] over the course of a few days or weeks to keep the daily volume as flat as possible and the price low.  
* Announce there will be an upcoming pump and encourage users to invite new people to find out what the pumped Coin is 10 seconds before the general public  
* Keep accumulating  
* On the day of the pump, add a sell limit order something like 300% above your initial buying average  
* Announce DONK to VIP's, who may get a 50-100% ROI, and then moments later announce DONK to the general public in the discord.  
* Sit and watch as your sell order is fulfilled with absolute ease.  
* Post in general chat about ""waiting for a second / third wave of pump"" to encourage people to hold on, while your VIP mates keep fleecing them.
* When the general chat is then filled with hundreds of people saying ""WTF? I've lost 80% in minutes?!"" remove their posts and mute the chat. Leave up anyone saying they made profit.
* Then wait for the next pump so another round of idiots can give you their hard-earned money.

And the fun part is? The owners of these PnD groups have multiple coins going at once, staggered out.  

How do I know this? I joined a PnD group out of curiosity at the start of the year. I put in literally a few quid to see what would happen and after the rug was pulled it became very clear how this would operate from an admin point of view.

CryptoCurrency,"Preface: I'm no expert, financial advisor, moonboy or Elon musk follower. I just want to know everyone's opinion and learn.

Is Bitcoin the safest investment? I have setup a recurring buy for bitcoin for a while now, and it's the only coin that seems legitimately worth the investment because of how well it's keeping it's price and how vastly it can be used (apart from eth maybe, but don't have enough money to invest a reasonable amount in both, yet.). 

I've also invested much smaller amounts of money in altcoins.. such as fantom, helium, axie and more... But is it worth it? Their volatility seems much much higher, and definitely not as reliable or versatile as bitcoin.

Now, what do you people buy altcoins for? Hoping for a quick moonshot? You believe something in particular from their project and keep holding until it rises? Or is it all useless and bitcoin and ETH will be the only ones in the future that will be usable as an actual currency?

As part of this, I‚Äôm looking to interview people whose jobs involve interacting with supply chains in some shape or form (so anyone who delivers, takes delivery of, or manages stock/raw materials; IT staff who manage stock systems; supply chain managers and senior managers who manage supply chain employees; and so on).¬†

It doesn‚Äôt matter if you have no idea what blockchain is, or if you‚Äôre a bona fide expert - I‚Äôm interested in your opinion.

The interview should take around 45 minutes to an hour to complete. Participant information will be provided beforehand, and all data will be handled in accordance with the University of Bristol ethics and GDPR policies. I'm more than happy to provide proof of authenticity upon request, in addition to my use of a university email address.

With NFTs, a whole virtual reality can emerge, recognizing and associating things with their owners in a unique way. Against this background, a question that arises is what is the future of NFTs? What can we expect from the NFT space in the future? Here are some of my top picks that could be the future of NFTs  


1) Music: NFTs can be used in the music industry, where artists can tokenize their music. Kings of Leon, a famous rock band, launched their debut album as an NFT, ""When You See Yourself."" This could be the future of music wherein artists can create one-of-a-kind NFTs as well.  


2) Leverage: Leveraging ones NFTs to either earn yields or as a loan is something that is catching up in this space. Projects like [Drops](https://drops.co) allow users to leverage their NFT assets to obtain loans and earn yield, significantly reducing the opportunity cost of holding them long-term. NFTify is a simple p2p marketplace for collateralized NFT loans. It allows borrowers to put up assets for a loan and lenders to make offers to lend in return for interest.  


3) Tickets: With the Wizards' team owner Ted Leonsis looking at using NFTs for virtual tickets, we can expect this trend to catch up with other NBA teams like The Mavs as well. While non-fungible tokens remain misunderstood and confusing to many, a lot of boosters in the pro basketball world welcome a future where NFTs are the norm.  


NFTs pave the way for digital content creators, allowing them to achieve more and receive more from their creations. For creators, the future of potential ownership via NFT is promising.

Today, we are talking about the agrarian society 2.0. I guess history really does repeat itself in new forms!

Today, we are talking about yield farming, the modern day agriculture. Instead of harvesting crops, we are harvesting tokens.

Yield farming is part of token distribution and user acquisition. It's basically mining tokens by using the protocol (i.e. executing trade). It's attractive because it's possible to get a 100% APY. But it comes with risks.

# 1. Projects Using Yield Farming

* **Sythetix**: issuing SNX tokens to liquidity provider. It worked since sETH tokens make up 1/3 of uniswap's liquidity pool
* **Curve Finance**: issue native tokens like SNX, REN, BAL, CRV to liquidity providers
* **Compound**: The total assets under Compound has surpassed Maker, the top DeFi app. It is the primary market for a decentralised money market. Daily COMP tokens are issued to users based on trading volume. It worked since 1 billion new assets entered the Compound market
* **Balancer**: Weekly BAL tokens are issued to users based on trading volume. Before the distribution, volume had generally been under $2 million. Since the distribution, it has generally been around $4 million. But on Sunday, June 28, volume shot up to $14 million.

That is exactly what exchange platforms are doing with their native tokens too, by incentivising market makers. It works for users because they are rewarded with extra tokens. It works of the platform because they are **onboarding new users**.

\[**Good**\] **Projects** like these are way **beyond** the stage of **just a white paper**. We have a working product that can be used and this is the first step towards getting a user base.

\[**Bad**\] This is **still a short-term incentive that is not sustainable**. What happens when the hype of trading is gone? Or when transaction fees are too expensive and it makes no economic sense to trade? Or when tokens are all given out?

\[**Bad**\] So far, it seems like the **yield is a zero-sum game**. If you don't know how to play, you should not participate. It may change in the future by increasing the size of pie, but for now, it is a beautiful zero sum. It means do not be the last sucker standing because you are going to suffer all the losses. If you don‚Äôt have insider knowledge or strategic advantage, you are not earning yield. You are the yield.

\[**Ugly**\] The real ugly part is the **hidden string attached**. Due to all the trade going on on ethereum, gas fees have shot through the roof. So **beware of gas fees, slippage fee, asset volatility.**

\[**Ugly**\] **Leveraged trading** can be good to secure greater upsides, but the downside can also be quite steep, especially since market is so volatile and you can get squeezed out quickly, if you have all your liquidity tied up in the the defi apps.

\[**Ugly**\] Because there are so many transactions (that may or may not be inflated), the transaction fees have soared. So, Ethereum is looking to i**ncrease the block size.** This is great for validators in the short run to increase their returns, but this is ugly risk in the long run because **ethereum network can be more vulnerable to attacks on the network.**

# 3. Economics of Yield Farming

* Token Design: Self-Reinforcing Mechanism. The token incentives create liquidity which starts a feedback loop.
* Valuation: at the end of the day, this method just encourages network effects without providing any real economic value. for protocols and projects to succeed, it depends on builders and users to stay on the platform for a long time, and not just during this movement. In the short term, we are also seeing an increase in token value.
* Token supply: this is a token supply increase, or supply inflation. It is also distributed to users with the highest volume. Instead of people paying for tokens, it is earned via the platform.
* Return of tokens: These tokens are not exactly free. early investors of the tokens have invested and receive tokens. they are happy for tokens to increase in value to cash out their returns. unless you have a strategic plan for using tokens to gain returns, you are just part of the plan. (Similar to IPO Pop)
* Transaction activities: borrowers are keen to borrow more because with the native token distribution, it is almost like they are subsidised to pay. The increase in trading results in higher transaction fees and attracts better returns as lenders.

This is a typical method for issuing tokens based on transaction volume, as we see in exchange tokens. Check out the BNB episode for the economics of that.

Yield farming is a growth hacking way to achieve network effects. It uses short-term incentives to drive user growth. At the end of the day, we are looking at the bigger game. In the long-run, how sustainable will the platform be. The real economic value comes from building products that benefits users in a sustainable manner, not with hypes and pumps. That means actual financial activity for DeFi protocols, so that monetary value increase is not just driven by ""sophisticated leveraged speculation"" but real value-add.

 

**TLDR**:

For crypto-entrepreneurs and long-term investors, yield farming works. But it is still a short-term incentive and not a long-term solution. So use this method with precaution.","‚û°Ô∏è Good, Bad, Ugly of Yield Farming | Econteric.com",1626690488

Cryptocurrency trading is a highly volatile asset market, and highly Volatile I mean expect %300 +- drops or gains. Most of us like me go for the gains, but when the market starts crashing down because of any FUD thats been perpetrated through Crypto media and Twitter FUD, the crash becomes inevitable, what makes the crash worse is that people like me on margin positions depending on the leverage position you are either about to lose a big a chunk of your Crypto or you are on your path to be liquidated in the crashes following that crash. To further understand this I have carefully assessed the lowest margin position I could and the results do not change, you are either in a panic mode wondering if you are going to be liquidated tomorrow or the week or month following that crash and perhaps paper hand your position to avoid further losses and look for a market bottom to re-enter your position, or leave the space to see the entire market pick up and fomo again. Long story short, this will keep happening this sort of whale manipulation or rinse and repeat and margin traders are perfect victim of this cycle and every other crypto cycle along with people who invest large chunks of their funds in shit coins. I know I am jumping through various points here, but basically my point is that if you are margin trading please dont, if you are investing in shit coins to make a quick bucks just to watch your entire portfolio melt then please dont.

CryptoCurrency,"This is a strategy which the first Bitcoin Millionaire I know taught me a few months ago.

He himself makes about 30k monthly by using this strategy.

I am able now to fully live off my crypto portfolio by building a steady income stream without having to sell my crypto.

This strategy involves three different use cases in DeFi. Borrowing, Liquidity Mining and Staking. To find out more about these topics you can visit the r/liquiditymining Subreddit and read about those topics in detail.

I call this strategy the ""Free Cash Flow Strategy"".

Alright so let's begin...

I think most of us believe that Crypto in general will go far beyond the valuation it is currently at and this is why it should be our main focus to accumulate more Crypto and not sell any. But also just holding assets and not being able to spend anything is kinda boring. So let's combine both and hold Crypto + build a steady Cash Flow.

The concept involves depositing Crypto as Collateral on platforms like Aave, Compound, Nexo, Liquity and so on, taking a loan on the platforms and moving them to Liquidity Mining platforms like Pancakeswap, Curve, etc.

Let's dive into what I did exactly:

* I deposited most of my Crypto on Nexo (I started small to see if it works obv.)
* On Nexo I took a **50% LTV** (Loan-To-Value) Loan which means 50% of what I deposited. There I paid 12% interest on the loan.
* I then split my loan on different Platforms into **Stable Coin Pools** which back then generated about 30% APY.
* I then took my Liquidity Mining Rewards and put them into staking which was another 100% I made on my rewards.
* I paid the 12% fees and kept about 18% as **Free Cash Flow**

The environment has changed however. Since we're in a correction or bear market however you wanna call it the tokens which are distributed as rewards aren't as high as they used to be but this doesn't really matter since we can earn the money now and spend it when prices move higher.

What do I do differently now?

* I don't use Nexo anymore since the interest is too high compared to the rewards you get now from Stablecoin Liquidity Mining which are only about 10%. I use Liquity for ETH which charges 0% interest but a 0.5% deposit fee which is way better in the long-run. And I use Aave/Compound for things like BTC (WBTC) and almost any other token there I pay about 3-4% yearly interest.
* I don't use Liquidity Mining Platforms anymore but Liquidity Aggregators like Autofarm, Beefy.finance or Pancakebunny because they auto-compound the profits instantly and distribute their own platform token on top which results in more yield.

Let's look at the potential risk of Liquidation:

Let's say you deposit 2 BTC and 20 ETH split on Aave &amp; Compound to diversify which is about $100k. Then you take out a loan of $50k which is a LTV of 50%. **Remember to always take out your loan in stable coins because they have the least amount of risk involved!**

BTC has a Liquidation LTV of 75% which means you have a 25% threshold. Liquity will Liquidate you at a LTV of 90.09%.

What does that mean?

After you deposit your Crypto and take out a loan the price of BTC might go up or down. If it goes up your LTV decreases and if it goes down your LTV increases. The magic here is to always keep it as high as possible but not too high so you surpass the limit they set for each currency.

LTV = Loan / Collateral \* 100%

Example:

You deposit 3 BTC=100k and take out 50k in USDT = 50% LTV.

BTC drops from 33.3k to 30k -&gt; 3 x 30k = 90k -&gt; 50k / 90k \* 100% = 55% LTV

BTC drops from 30k to 20k -&gt; 3 x 20k = 60k -&gt; 50k / 60k \* 100% = 83% LTV = **Liquidated!**

**When you start and take out a loan you have to calculate at what price target you will get liquidated!** You need to keep this price in mind and if the price drops you can either pay back your loan or increase your collateral by depositing more Crypto to the platform.

Currently you can borrow stable coins for about 4% and do stable coin liquidity mining at a 20% APY. (We already made a post in r/liquiditymining talking about the highest stable coin LM APYs). If you then stake your rewards your APY can go higher to about 30-40% which leads you with a 26%-36% cash flow which at an investment of 100k and a loan of 50k means you can make between $13'000-$18'000 yearly which is a nice salary on top for doing nothing! :D

Keep in mind that if your coins you used as collateral go up (which they eventually will) you can borrow more capital and your cash flow increases!

And this ladies and gentlemen is how you keep your Crypto and build a nice cash flow on the side!

&amp;#x200B;

There is a false idea about the anonymity of cryptocurrencies. I am sure that many of you think that using Bitcoin, your operations and transactions are encrypted and cannot be tracked by third parties at all. This is not true.

&amp;#x200B;

Bitcoin, like the vast majority of cryptocurrencies, is pseudonymous. What does it mean? Let's figure it out.

&amp;#x200B;

All the anonymity of Bitcoin and most other cryptocurrencies is manifested only in the fact that the address of your crypto wallet is not tied to your identity in any way. That is, when you start a new wallet, you should not provide any data about yourself, and in fact, anyone can be the owner of the wallet. You can also transfer the wallet to someone else's possession to anyone. But that's all. This is where all anonymity ends.

&amp;#x200B;

Otherwise, Bitcoin is the opposite of anonymity. The Bitcoin blockchain is a solid notebook where every transaction ever made in the entire history of the Bitcoin network is recorded. And it's all in the public domain. You can go to this site (or to this one if it is Ethereum), enter the address of the Bitcoin wallet there, and find out how much money is in the account, when and from whom this money came, went, etc. Full transparency and openness.

&amp;#x200B;

Some of you will probably say: ""Well, what's the difference? No one can prove that this is my wallet! "" And you will be right, but not always.

&amp;#x200B;

You are right only if your wallet is really anonymous and no one knows about its existence except you. But if you have entered the address of your wallet in crypto exchanges or published it somewhere on the Internet, then there is a huge chance that you and your crypto wallet can be connected. Do not forget that at the request of the authorities (or individuals on the black market), any social network, provider, the mobile operator will hand over any information about you. And then you will just need to connect the dots to have dirt on you.

&amp;#x200B;

""Listen, why do I need all this at all? I'm not hiding anything from anyone! "" -one of you will say. But this post is not about hiding something from someone. The only purpose of this post is to dispel the myth of the anonymity of cryptocurrencies. 

&amp;#x200B;

Everyone likes free money, but here's the thing: most of these are scams, and most of the others are not worth it.

Sure, you can use Brave browser or a few months and see thousands of ads to earn a dollar in BAT, or you could exploit a faucet and get free crypto from there every day for a few weeks, to end up with something like a dollar once again (this is not what faucets are for, please don't do this). You could spam all your social media feeds promoting some scam coin because they promised you you would get an airdrop if you did. I would argue, however, that this is not the best way to spend your time. Not considering stuff like staking that can definitely pay off, but that requires that you already own crypto, there are three ways of earning free crypto for beginners without crypto who want to start out with crypto but don't want to invest yet that, in my opinion, are worth your time:

1) r/CryptoCurrency Moons. You get moons every 28 days if you participate on this sub, if you have opened your vault, depending on the amount of karma you collect. You can get a ton of free crypto here - not as much as a year ago, but i only posted here for the past like 4 months and have over 10k moons, currently worth about $1,000 - and it absolutely is possible that they will be worth much more in the future. If you are interested in crypto and would post here anyway, this is a great way to earn free tokens. See the [Introduction to Moons](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/gj96lb/introducing_rcryptocurrency_moons/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=usertext&amp;utm_name=CryptoCurrency&amp;utm_content=t3_okgzix) and the [Moons wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/wiki/moons_wiki/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=usertext&amp;utm_name=CryptoCurrency&amp;utm_content=t3_okgzix) for more info.

2) [Coinbase Earn](https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/getting-started/getting-started-with-coinbase/coinbase-earn-faq-and-terms). You need an account on Coinbase, have it verified, and you need to live in an eligible country.^(A) They show you some information about specific crypto and then ask really easy question, you get a small amount of that crypto if you get them right (you can retry them), you get the money immediately. I personally never spent money on Coinbase and got a lot of money on there (probably around $250 - I originally got less, but many coins went up in value a lot since I did the respective quizzes). **Con: I've read many times that people were stuck in a queue and could not participate in the quizzes, I personally never had that problem.**

3) [Coinmarketcap Earn](https://coinmarketcap.com/earn/). It's similar, but a bit worse. You need a verified account on Binance, some countries are excluded from participating (one of them being the US).^(B) Again, you can answer a few questions about some crypto and you get small amounts (usually a bit bigger than on Coinbase Earn) if you get them right - but, in this case, you only have one chance and need to get all of them right. If you get them right, and if you are quick enough, the coins usually get sent to your Binance account after a few weeks. **Con: I've seen many people state that they never got any coins even though they got everything right, even calling it a scam. It is definitely not a scam, I got coins multiple times, but the quizzes often run longer than they should and only the first few thousand participants receive coins. You can always** [**check the status**](https://coinmarketcap.com/earn/token-distribution-status) **of your coins or why you will not get them on their page.**

All in all, I got much more than $1,000 with these three methods - earning moons just hanging out and having fun on this sub, and only spending a few minutes with the quizzes (they are really not long). While there might be other ways of earning free crypto for beginners, I haven't found any others that are worth your time - but I am looking forwardto you proving me wrong!

CryptoCurrency,"News: Binance is going to introduce the BNB Pioneer Burn Program. 

Basically, if you ""lost"" an amount of BNB or any other binance-pegged/wrapped token over $1,000 (like sent it to a smart contract address, which nobody has control over), you let Binance know, they verify and then REIMBURSE you minus the network fees!

Where do the money come from? Binance still can't recover your lost funds and they still can't mint new tokens. But, since they regularly burn their team's tokens, they will deduct the corresponding amount of BNB from their burn. In effect, Binance will burn less BNB's, but only because YOU already burned those for them! 

Here is their example: *Assume 1,000,000 BNB will be burned in the upcoming BNB burn event for the third quarter of 2020. However, before the event, we had returned 5,000 BNB to users through the BNB Pioneer Burn program. As a result, for our Q3 burn, we will burn 995,000 BNB instead (the original 1,000,000 BNB burn amount minus the 5,000 BNB that went to the BNB Pioneer Burn program).*   

On the one hand, the idea is great ‚Äì throwing a lifeline to the pioneers who messed up when trying out new tech. And it doesn't require centralized censorship of the blockchain to revert transactions. **Should other blockchains do this as well?**

On the other hand, it is Binance who will decide whom to reimburse and, in the end, BURN LESS TOKENS! Remember they SWORE and keep claiming they WILL NOT SELL a single BNB from their team's stash. Now I think they can) while still sitting on that high horse)

### 1. Bitcoin (BTC)

**Market cap: Over $641 billion**

Bitcoin‚Äôs price has skyrocketed as it‚Äôs become a household name. Five years ago, you could buy a Bitcoin for about $500. As of June 2021, a single Bitcoin‚Äôs price was over $32,000. That‚Äôs growth of about 6,300%.

**Market cap: Over $56 billion**

Its price in 2017 was just $0.10; by June 2021, it had risen to over $350, a gain of almost 350,000%.

2. The way Bitcoin was created is almost as important as Bitcoin. Anonymous creator, no financial incentive, open-source for anyone to use, had $0 value for a year. It's like humans discovering gold for the first time
3. Any Bitcoin fork is a waste of time. Imagine if the creator of the universe could create a knock off gold at any time and put it in the ground for us. For value, we seek items that have rare properties. meanwhile Satoshi created the scarcest asset known to mankind.
4. Not even one of the largest countries could cripple Bitcoin.
5. There's **way** smarter people than me that already understand this and are doing everything they can to accumulate as much as possible via manipulation.

I googled Uniswap and I clicked on the first result (which was sponsored).
I was in a hurry so when the website asked me for the seed words to link my wallet I blindly fell in the trap. 
I later found out that the website was a fake version but it somehow appeared first in the google results. That‚Äôs how I lost 0,7 Eth (around 300$ at the time).

I said to me that 300$ was a high enough price for this lesson and didn‚Äôt want the price to be 0,7 Eth (I believed in Ethereum ‚Äòs future value). So what I did right after the same day was to buy the lost quantity of Eth, spending 300$.

CryptoCurrency,"- Hi guys üëã, during a two-hour car ride, I chose to look into stablecoins, as I saw enormous interest rates. So below is the information I gathered from a range of different sites and put together for myself, and now for you guys. Sorry for potential layout mistakes, as I‚Äôve put this together on my phone üòÇ. Enjoy - 

Basically, stablecoins suggest a new alternative for reducing price volatility in the crypto landscape. The volatility makes cryptocurrency somewhat unreliable as a suitable currency for exchanging goods and services. So, the best stablecoins which have emerged in the crypto space have solved this problem. By nature, stablecoins are highly fixed in terms of value when compared to general cryptocurrency alternatives.¬†

According to a report by CB Insights, the overall value of stablecoin assets has crossed well over $20 billion in late 2020. Stablecoins have gained traction as they attempt to offer the best of both worlds‚Äîthe instant processing and security or privacy of payments of cryptocurrencies, and the¬†volatility-free stable valuations of fiat currencies.

They promise lower volatility, which makes them useful for converting between fiat and other cryptocurrencies. Some of the most prominent examples are: USDT, TUSD, DAI, PAX, GUSD.

What makes fiat currency free from extreme volatility? 

When a fiat currency‚Äôs valuations may move drastically, the controlling authorities jump in and manage the demand and supply of currency to maintain price stability. The bulk of cryptocurrencies lacks both these key features - they don‚Äôt have a reserve backing their valuations and they don‚Äôt have a central authority to control prices when required. Stablecoins attempt to bridge this gap between fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies.

Stablecoins can be fixed to almost anything in theory, there are Stablecoins fixed to multiple fiat coins and even to precious items like gold or silver. Four main categories exists: 

Backed by a commodity: Stablecoins that are pegged against commodities generally have the backing of hard assets for stability. The hard assets could include real estate or gold. 

Backed by a crypto asset: Crypto-collateralized¬†stablecoins are backed by other cryptocurrencies. Since the reserve cryptocurrency may also be prone to high volatility, such stablecoins are ‚Äúover-collateralized‚Äù‚Äîthat is, a larger number of cryptocurrency tokens is maintained as reserve for issuing a lower number of stablecoins. More frequent audits and monitoring add to price stability. However, because the crypto values themselves are not stable, these Stablecoins need to use a set of protocols to ensure that the price of the stablecoin issued remains at $1.

Backed by fiat currency: Fiat-backed cryptocurrencies as the most commonly accessible stablecoins. Such types of stablecoin have the backing of fiat currencies such as the US Dollar, Euro, or Chinese Yuan, which are kept as collateral (a fiat currency reserve is maintained). Such reserves are maintained by¬†independent custodians and are regularly audited for adherence¬†to the necessary compliance. Production and liquidation of the coin is carried out by the issuer of the coin. 

Backed by an algorithm: Non-collateralized¬†stablecoins don‚Äôt use any reserve¬†but¬†include a working mechanism, like that of a central bank, to retain a stable price. For instance, the dollar-pegged basecoin uses a consensus mechanism to increase or decrease the supply of tokens on need basis.

But‚Ä¶ but‚Ä¶ but‚Ä¶

Placing you money in a stable coin is not without its risks as many stablecoins lack consumer protections and provide patchy, frequently unaudited accounts of the reserves meant to back their coins. Tether, the $60bn stablecoin, was fined $18.5m by the New York attorney-general over allegations it lied about its reserves. 

When should you care about stablecoins?

If you cannot keep a close eye on market conditions or changes, or if you are simply not familiar with all these, it may be wise to keep your digital assets in Stablecoins. Also, during bearish market times, you can favourably keep your digital assets in stablecoins. 

Why are they interesting? 

With stablecoins you can minimise volatility, trade or save assets, transfer money cheaply, send money internationally, and lastly the one I‚Äôm going to focus on here, you can earn interests. 

Currently, exchanges like crypto.com offer up to 14% (!!!!) p.a. Interest on certain stablecoins. To me, that sounds ludicrous, as my bank currently offers me next to no interest (some even make you pay for keeping your OWN money with them). So what is going on in the crypto space? 

How can you get a hold of these high interest rates?

By using a third-party crypto loan platform - you will be lending your stablecoins out. In return, you will be paid a rate of interest that in many cases is significantly higher than what you can get through a traditional savings account.

Your chosen crypto loan platform will charge the end-user a higher rate than what you receive in interest (called the spread) ‚Äì this is how the provider is able to pay you. 

However, there seem to be two main risks: (1) As mentioned earlier, a stablecoin provider needs to hold a reserve of an asset, so at some point it comes down to trust, and their ability to keep the reserve intact. (2) You need to consider the safety of the platform itself. After all, it is not the stablecoin provider that is paying you interest. On the contrary, this is paid by a third-party that collects digital currencies from depositors and then lends the funds out via a loan agreement. Furthermore, you are NOT insured.

Lastly, you should be aware that most places (if not all?) you have to ‚Äúlock up‚Äù your stablecoin holding for a certain period of time to accrue the ‚Äúabnormal‚Äù interest rates. 

TL;DR - You can place your savings in high interest stablecoins, but it is, in theory, at the risk of losing your entire investment.",Learn: What the h*** is a stablecoin?,1626680511
CryptoCurrency,"**Answer:** extremely. 

~1.1-1.3% of the world owns BTC right now ([Source](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/how-many-bitcoin-users/)). 

17% of adult Americans own BTC ([Source](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/about-46-million-americans-now-own-bitcoin-2021-05-14)).

**Where does that put BTC on the trajectory of adoption (in the US)?**:

[Adoption Rates of Major Technologies, 1990-2021](https://i.postimg.cc/7Z5d47HH/Screenshot-20210719101838-1006x707.png)

In reality, it's &lt;17%. Many have not truly adopted BTC/crypto, but are merely short-term speculative traders or those caught up in the hype. Post-crash estimates may be as low as ~5-8%. And the number of active addresses for BTC is currently ~500,000 - meaning just a tiny fraction of the world is actually *using* BTC. 

Most cryptocurrencies would not even register on this chart yet.

CryptoCurrency,"I‚Äôve been following the stable coin FUD pretty closely. Especially with US regulators starting to investigate.

Tether especially is raising some big eyebrows. With shifting goalposts and mystery ‚Äúcommercial paper‚Äù they won‚Äôt disclose. 

But even USDC is acting shady as hell.

First they claim they‚Äôre backed 1 to 1 to USD, then they say ‚Äúactually we‚Äôre only backed by partial cash, the rest are ‚Äúapproved investments‚Äù.

But then they don‚Äôt disclose the investments. 

Ok makes sense I guess, the companies need to make money, and they do that by putting the cash reserves to work. So why didn‚Äôt they just come out and say that‚Äôs how they profit in the first place? And why won‚Äôt they disclose the investments?

Banks do the same thing with investing cash‚Ä¶.but they don‚Äôt (and can‚Äôt) really hide what they‚Äôre doing with it. And ultimately banks are regulated as banks, insured by the FDIC. 

Stable coins are asking the entire crypto universe to ‚Äútrust us‚Äù with supporting essentially the entire exchange market‚Äôs liquidity.

If they have nothing to hide, why don‚Äôt they just show all the cards?

Presumably USDC could be backed by something safe like treasury notes. Cool, great‚Ä¶ just say that then!  What‚Äôs the risk in publicly saying it‚Äôs backed with treasury notes?

It‚Äôd be so easy to end the stable coin FUD, but for some reason they‚Äôre choosing not to.

CryptoCurrency,"The reason why we're investing in stuff (shares, valuable metals, etc.) is to protect our money from inflation and losing it's value. Why people are so enthusiastic of BTC and not gold or usd? (the currency of most powerful country.) Let's look at the buying power of the USD on a timeline chart.

[As you can see. for every passing year, the buying power of one USD is going down exponentially. People who held USD as an investment since 2000's has lost \~60&amp;#37; of their money's buying power.](https://preview.redd.it/latk7rs4a4c71.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b934e7b234e3545f833a974acaee947b2dc37acd)

[This is the inflation adjusted chart for GOLD. As you can see, people who bought gold from 1980's until 2000's to protect their money from inflation and losing it's value, let alone earned any money but lost around 80&amp;#37; of their money.

There are too many factors to keep in mind, such as (but not limited to) news, hype, FUD, insider info and Technical analysis. When you combine all that together, it all comes down to ""who the hell knows what will happen with that volatile mix of information"".

Also *NOT A FINANCIAL, NOR PROFESSIONAL, ADVICE*. Make safe decisions for yourselves!

1) if the project is actually good, so is its investment

2) marketing! Currently as I'm trying to get my book out in the market, I know one thing, no matter how good it will be, I know I won't go far without either luck of readers spreading word or solid marketing

If your liked crypto project has these two, no matter the time, it may very well soar in price one day. Could be tomorrow. Could be next few years.

Point is, make small steps. It doesn't matter if you DCA two doggit baby funds, or some serious funds. Do, however, play it safe enough to have some fiat ready for worldwide crash.

A good investment eventually pays off.

Don't get scared by the current downtrend. Relax. DCA, if you don't have funds to do so, fund something else to do in the meantime, while you wait for payday. Remember to do it responsibly though.

CryptoCurrency,"Someone tried to scam me on reddit. It was the single most obvious scam I have ever seen someone try to push. They started promising 6% a DAY on my investment. Lets take a look at the anatomy of a scammer in case these red flags are new to some of you. 

First off they tried to be friendly and hook greedy people with the idea of making money easily. They also prey on fear, saying that ""bitcoin is dropping past resistance levels"". Then they casually asked me where I was from. I told them Zeta Reticulon (not even the right name for the star) and they didn't even stop to think about what I just said. The first two major red flags of a scam are easy money and personal information. 

Then I told them I was already involved in risky behaviors trying to push it to see how ridiculous of a pitch they would throw my way. [ I told them I was in a program that was netting me 1% a day, every day.](https://imgur.com/Kyrltjh) Anything offering that kind of reward is almost certainly a scam. Just for reference a $10,000 investment at 1% a day, compounded daily, sitting for 3 years would be worth $544,785,657.92. Yup half a billion dollars. 

This guy didn't stop at 1%. [I told him I was getting one percent and he shot back with this. Yup you read that right! The max they were offering is 10% in 12 hours.](https://imgur.com/Ahh0Tae) Or 20% in 24 hours. Every darn day. I ran that through a compound interest calculator and let it sit for the same 3 years. That would be 6.0624151E+90 or a 6 then 90 zeros. Lets just write that out: 

$6,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000

These people have no shame. If they could really get those returns they would never ever tell you. Not only that but I am pretty sure that means my 10k investment would be worth more than all the money on the earth. These people prey on the greedy, the desperate, and people who don't do math. I asked them why they would ever let me in on this, I mean clearly they don't need the money. [Look at this response.](https://imgur.com/0RGXLOX)

In 2015, Reddit launched Reddit Notes to users (5 million $ worth I think) which are basically Moons but Centralized with Reddit controlling everything, This probably got Reddit into problems with the SEC and the project was deleted.


In 2020, Reddit introduced Moons, on Paper Moons doesn‚Äôt have monetary value! This will keep the SEC away because these are points with no value!

But here is the smart part üß†:
Moons are on the Blockchain, If you earn them, no one can take them from you even Reddit themselves (Unlike Reddit Notes), Now for the ‚ÄúNo Monetary Value ‚Äú part:

ERC 20 can be traded on any exchange without Reddit‚Äôs request/approval to list them, that‚Äôs the power of blockchain! (Moons are not even on Mainnet and can be traded already!)

Ok but if Moons get listed on exchanges,  how can Reddit benefit from this? They can‚Äôt send Moons to trade because the SEC will be monitoring them.

So here‚Äôs what can happen:
Reddit will publish many NFTs for sale.
Reddit declare wallet hack and Moons get withdrawn from their wallet, sent to an exchange, traded for ETH then scrambled to get laundered ETH that are not associated with the Moons.

Reddit will buy their own NFT with the clean ETH and GG!

Essentially, I could immediately use uniswap to swap ETH for PMON at a rate much higher than the wider market could provide right? The immediate next transaction in the block did exactly that: https://etherscan.io/tx/0x6f8a4dd3eb301cf6889cd05df46d936cccc0aeb1c76f10a714fb265c24d2b3de .

My question is, why would anybody add liquidity at a ratio of PMON:ETH that was so far from the ratio based on the true market value (nearly 80 times too high)? The correct ratio can be checked beforehand and such a mistake can so easily be taken advantage of; why would anybody perform this transaction? Is there any reason to expose oneself to liquidity sniping so egregiously?

CryptoCurrency,"So I decided to try understand how the Grayscale trust works. When their webpage and did some TA on thier chart and FA on terms and conditions 

https://grayscale.com/products/grayscale-bitcoin-trust/


From my understanding 

1. You give them $50,000.00 to purchase BTC. Which they charge a 2% annual fee ( $1000)
2. In exchange you get GBTC shares at a rate of 0.00093992 Satoshi per share. So ~1,064 GBT = 1 BTC 
3. You have to hold the shares in lock up for 6 months before you can sell them in a secondary market 

This seems all ok on the surface until you realise that GBTC is currently trading at ~$26. So I BTC is being sold for ~$27,661.93 which at current BTC prices of ~$31,600.00 is a -10.5% discount 

Once again if you are buying it's all good because you are getting BTC at below market value. However you have the lock up period 

People who purchased GBTC through Grayscale in January had an opposite scenario happen. They purchased at a premium of nearly 11.26% 


https://ycharts.com/companies/GBTC/discount_or_premium_to_nav

They bought BTC at a 11.56% higher price and now are being given the ""privilege"" of selling at -12% below market value 

If wanting to get into GBTC I would suggest just buying it when the discount is super low on the secondary market. It was -21% in May and if BTC pricr pumps you can maybe sell it with the premium up again 

For the unlock today I have to be a little vulgar 

Its fucked, you see some of the people who got GBTC in January are filthy financial degenerates who smoke leverage on the daily 

They bought in using $100s of Millions if not a billions of borrowed funds. Now are selling close break even or in loss. Plus fees they are definitely in the shit 

Their only plays are to

1. Borrow more money and buy BTC in the market in the hope it pumps

Conversely, a peer to peer system can take place where fiat can be exchange into crypto. The thing which will be different is that all cash and standard currency will eventually end up in a physical Crypto Bank.

Now that 1crpt could be used anywhere in the college and even be given back to the fund to receive $1.

CryptoCurrency,"A friend just talked to me about using his credit cards to BTFD.  And he already had credit card debt before this.

For god's sake people, don't rack up credit card debt to accumulate crypto.  The rate on a lot of those cards is over 20% per year.

You want crypto to disrupt the traditional banking/fiat system, right?  Think about it this way ... by racking up credit card debt, you're increasing the profits of some of the most predatory of all the fiat institutions -&gt; credit card issuers.

Don't support the thing that you want to destroy.  Pay off those credit card balances first.  There will always be time to DCA into crypto afterwards.  And remember, the dip may dip further in the meantime, so once you have those credit cards paid off, you might get better prices.

So, Jamie Dimon is advising us to stay away from things that don‚Äôt have assets backing them up. Right, so does that mean I should stay away from the US dollar? Good advice I guess. 

What are your thoughts on this? It sounds pretty hypocritical to me. But, there is reason to believe crypto isn‚Äôt really backed by anything (at least nothing tangible). I think we can say certain cryptos like Bitcoin (among many others) are no different than the dollar in that they are backed up by faith.

First ever art NFT on ETH.

""Curio Cards are one of the very first implementations of collectible tokens on the Ethereum blockchain ‚Äî even earlier than Moon Cat Rescue and CryptoPunks.

The project was created by Travis Uhrig, Thomas Hunt, and Rhett Creighton, launching on May 9, 2017. It consisted of a continuous ‚Äúdigital art show‚Äù which spanned 4 months, showcasing a total of 30 collectible digital Curio Cards from a total of seven different digital artists.""

This is why Curio cards are getting some huge attention right now ! They went from not even the top 100 in sales on Open Sea for the past 7 days to they are now top 10 with 1205 ETH sold and that was basically all done in the last four days.

In fact, they are gaining so much popularity, Businessman/ Influencer Gary vee has just went HARD buying over 100 ETH worth of cards and he hasn't even begun telling others about it besides a few small tweets replying to others. The other person he replied to was President of NBA team the 76ers,Daryl Morey, who bought almost a full set which is going for over 170 ETH so far as well the last time I checked!

Honestly, Curio Cards are a piece of history as the predate CryptoPunks which are selling for an a floor of 30 ETH and thats their biggest selling point. "" Wee are the first ever NFTs on Ethereum."" I love CryptoPunks but the truth is they are not and never were the first NFT but you can get some curio cards right now for .10- 1 ETH which is 30x times the difference. 

The market is not doing well but the market for NFTs are doing much better and the fact this gaining steam and is being discovered as the true first NFT on ETH lets you knowt this has ALOT of room for growth.

CryptoCurrency,"It started with my dad. It‚Äôs important first to tell his experience with investing because I believe his experience shaped my views on investing today.

He immigrated to the US from Chile as a teenager looking for work and better opportunities. The family back Chile was living off his mom‚Äôs Air Force paycheck (a few hundred bucks a month if that) because his dad was out of a job for years. On such a low paycheck they could not afford to buy my dad a plane ticket to the US. So he saved up for more than 3 years selling anything he could. He sold shoes, trading cards, he hosted parties in his home, sold candy, delivered newspapers, and when the Air Force sent his mom over to the US to consult with the embassy in DC he brought back a walkman (portable CD player), denim jeans and jackets, and plenty of other things that you could never find in his country at that time.

Once he saved up enough money he bought himself a plane ticket and flew to the DC area. Took a few years but he met my mom, worked his ass off while initially living in my grandparent‚Äôs basement and eventually got promoted to regional manger of a chain of hotels. 

Some time before the recession in 2008 he got into buying and selling homes. Eventually, we were able to build a beach house in Wilmington, South Carolina. The times spent at the beach house were some of the most enjoyable times in my life as a kid. The journey up to the time we bought the beach front property wasn‚Äôt pretty though.

My parents struggled with debt. They would consistently max out their credit cards before they had kids by spending it on vacations. By the time they had me and my brother they had to file for bankruptcy and wait 5 years before they could get another loan. Yet, quite ironically, this 5 year period was when my dad started buying and selling homes. He rebuilt his credit this way and built his investment empire right up to the point when we built the beach house. 

Things were going great for my family. We had multiple homes, 300 grand in our bank account, and a lot of respect from my extended family. Then it came time to refinance the ARM (adjustable rate mortgage) in 2008 we got for the beach house. He went to the bank and they refused to finance it. He went to another and they refused as well. Turns out, no bank at that time was refinancing or handing out new loans. The market crash had begun. 

We sold all our homes at a loss, almost lost the home we lived in, and the hotel that my dad worked for went into bankruptcy and laid him off. He went through a series of attempts to reinvent himself from selling courses on home buying, to starting a cleaning business, to selling insurance. 

In my high school years I saw my dad go back to Chile to start a business. He started a teeth whitening business, sold that one to his employees, and then started a marketing firm that got quite successful and was valued in the millions. I was quite inspired by him so I visited Chile several times to travel and to work in his business packing merchandise, operating the printing machines for logos, installing the internet in the office, updating the computers, delivering packages with his driver, visiting our vendors to purchase products in bulk, and a slew of other things. 

Unfortunately, a recession in Chile, coupled with overspending in the business and some operational mismanagement led to a decline in sales for several years. This was around the time I went to college and joined the military.

Fast-forward to 2019 the business was still reeling from the collateral damage of the recession in Chile. By that time I was introduced to Coinbase by my best friend. I thought it was a curious thing this cryptocurrency. So I threw in $60 to hopefully make some quick gains. Watched my holdings go up to $100 and crash back down to $30 in late 2019. I decided to keep holding since I still needed to recover my losses. I even added bitcoin to my holdings in February 2020.

But, when I saw the stock market crash in March I cashed everything out at a loss and bought Uber in the stock market. Then I bought Facebook, Microsoft, and a few others doubling my initial investment and then tripling by the end of 2020. My dad did the same thing as well but only after we sold our childhood home in February of 2020. We fell on hard times so we needed the cash. With that money my dad made a living trading on the stock market and made a killing while I just sat back and watched the show tripling my principal while sitting on my ass lol.

2021 came around and I heard about the dogecoin craze. I bought in on January but sold for a profit at around 8 cents because I was scared it might drop again. Then I wised up and committed fully to crypto. I bought a ledger nano and some bitcoin. Then later Ethereum, Cardano, Amp, and an assortment of free cryptos I got from Coinbase. I later learned about staking and other ways of earning crypto. 

In retrospect, if we hadn‚Äôt fallen on hard times throughout 2020 with my dad doing Uber to survive (while his girlfriend was operating the business in Chile) and me doing school and working to pay my own bills I likely would not have dropped into the stock market the way I did and subsequently crypto. This is the reason why the history of my dad‚Äôs business ventures is a good chunk of this post. It was such a formative series of ventures that bled into my life in good and bad ways.

I started with Coinbase Pro in May, but unfortunately CbPro only shows users their current portfolio value and doesn't offer any management or tracking tools like a typical brockerage's online GUI would. From what I can tell, most Coinbase users subscribe to online portfolio managers to track their returns, generate charts, etc. 

This is a sensible move -- but I'm too stubborn and too curious for my own good. I decided to save money and learn a bit by spending absolutely way too much time learning about web API's and Coinbase Pro's API in particular. I'm now developing my own crypto portfolio management software in Python.

First thing I wanted to do is understand how the overall portfolio has performed. The most straightforward way I could think of was to divide the total portfolio value in USD per day since inception by the total amount of USD deposits made until then. This gives a simple ratio, where values greater than one mean the portfolio is worth more than the deposits, and values less than one mean the portfolio is worth less. Behold the fruits of my keyboard labor (the image I tried to attach -- I'm new to Reddit posting too, so bear with me please). 

The result paints a pretty dismal picture of my trading. My portfolio value has been in the red since the start of June and dipped as low as \~65 percent of my deposits. As of yesterday I've been sitting at about 80 percent. 

Anyways, developing this tool has me pretty excited and I wanted to share my start with y'all. If anyone has recommendations for free (or cheap!) crypto portfolio management software that offers tools a normal brokerage would, I'm all ears -- same goes for recommended analyses, charts, etc that I should tackle next.

CryptoCurrency,"I would like to hear more about ADA and how it is going to work compared to Ethereum mainly. I have already learned a lot about it, but I just don't know how it is actually going to work against Ethereum or Binance smart chain. 

The main concern is that I have seen in the measly research I have been able to do on this topic, that moving a coin from Eth/Bsc is a lot harder than deploying a coin from Eth to Polygon or Bsc. 

Using the Bsc deployer for an Eth token is not hard to do mainly because of both Bsc and Eth use Solidity as it's programming language for Erc-20 and the Smart contracts. 

But ADA is using Haskell, which can be difficult for some people to learn, just so their token is present on one more chain. 

Yes these are still only about the future, but I am just really curious to know how it's going to stand in the long run. (I think it is still promising and they will get around the Programming Language Barrier)",Discussion: How does ADA actually compare to ETH/BNB?,1626656804

https://www.bis.org/publ/othp38.pdf

Here is the summary of you were skeptical :)

Many central banks are currently investigating risks, benefits and various designs of CBDCs, but with a strong focus on domestic needs. Only a few central banks have made firm design choices so far. Implications of CBDCs, even if only intended for domestic use, will go beyond borders, making it crucial to coordinate work and find common ground. If coordinated successfully, the clean slate presented by CBDCs might ‚Äì in time and in combination with other improvements ‚Äì be leveraged to enhance cross- border payments.

This report has shown how CBDC could facilitate enhanced cross-border payments conceptually, and how efforts in practice are taking these considerations forward. The arrangements facilitating such payments imply different degrees of international integration and cooperation, ranging from basic compatibility with common standards to the establishment of international payment infrastructures. The analysis highlights both the need for multilateral collaboration and the importance of interoperability between CBDCs.

In order to achieve the potential benefits for public welfare while preserving financial stability, further exploration on CBDC design choices and their macro-financial implications is essential. Various important and complex questions are still to be further analysed, for instance as regards the interoperability between existing and new infrastructures, the access to and control of central bank money, the distinction between wholesale and retail CBDC, the role of private industry actors, and many others.

While CBDCs have unique features, enhancements in the other building blocks of the cross-border payments programme, such as aligning regulatory, supervisory and oversight frameworks for cross-border payments, AML/CFT consistency, PvP adoption and payment system access32 will be critical for cross-border CBDC use. This reinforces the importance of the overall G20 roadmap to comprehensively enhance cross-border payments. For example, the idea of encouraging interoperability between CBDCs has strong structural similarities to establishing links between the payment infrastructures of different countries and the investigation into the feasibility of new multilateral cross-border payment platforms.33 Also, the eventual international adoption of CBDCs is likely to proceed at different speeds in different jurisdictions, calling for interoperability with legacy payment arrangements. Hence, the subsequent action of this building block (19) calls, among others, for the analysis of interoperability with non-CBDC payment arrangements.34",Good read - Digital currency international central bank.,1626653956

CryptoCurrency,"The Crypto market is always a very volatile place. If you are trying to get rich by dumping money that you cannot afford to lose (mortgaging your house, life savings, retirement funds ...) into the crypto space. Then all you are doing is rolling a dice in a Casino. 

You need to look at what you are investing and making sure you are not:   


1. Getting involved with shitcoins, or other altcoins you have heard a YouTuber talking about. You have to DYOR to be confident in your investment and with that, your mind will be at ease when there is a dip because you **know** what you have bought.
2. Being **blinded** by dreams of a getting rich quick scheme
3. Putting in money that you just **cannot afford to lose**.
4. Letting your **emotions** get the better of you. Such as panic selling and panic buying when the market is going up or down. 

It is important to note several important concepts in crypto when the prices are increasing. Such as the followings.  


1. Buying near ATHs, I myself have made this mistake. My emotions and FOMO got the better of me and I have learnt my lesson. Never again, **always buy low sell high**.
2. When there is a massive dip in the market, like the one we are experiencing currently. It is a good time to invest, but not all in one go. **DCA is the best way to go**, statistics have proven this to be the best approach. 
3. HODL, DCA and STAKING are your best friends

CryptoCurrency,"If you have a few favorite crypto YouTubers, or like to look at price predictions on FXStreet or InvestingCube, put their TA and other predictions to the test. 

First, listen closely to what they are saying. There are so many YouTubers that cover all their bases if you pay attention. Make a checklist. Did they say the price might go up? Yes. Did they say the price might go down? Yes. Did they say there‚Äôs a big possibility it might dump, followed by a big pump? Yes. Did they say it could trade sideways for a while longer? Yes. So many of them predict all of the above in every video. Your confirmation bias picks what it wants to hear and goes with that and suddenly, your favorite YouTuber looks like a genius, or at least makes you feel good. They are also able to cherry-pick moments from their past videos to say ‚ÄúI called it!‚Äù down the road even though they called out literally every possibility. They post a bunch of bullish videos and suddenly the market takes a huge dump and their next videos all say ‚ÄúI was saying this might happen back in March‚Ä¶‚Äù because, yes, of course they mentioned it in a video, however briefly it may have been. 

As for all those articles posted predicting future price action? Look back a few weeks or a few months, or even a year, at their old predictions and you can see they are all just throwing shit at a wall to see what sticks. Look at their post history. 9 times out of 10, articles are written that say a different thing every few days or every other week. Again, they can cherry-pick the articles that were close to right to show just how accurate they were. 

Moral of the story? Take everything you read or watch with a grain of salt. Nobody really knows what will happen next. Some try to provide educated guesses, but almost all try to phrase what they say and how they say it, and then post so frequently that eventually they get a few things right. Remain skeptical and don‚Äôt fall into a trap because you yourself are cherry-picking the things you want to hear or seeking out the bullish articles that make you feel good. They all project such confidence, yet are basing all their predications on a very new emerging technology, evolving rapidly, and changing daily with so few market cycles, you can rarely predict what will happen next.

CryptoCurrency,"Hello, and welcome to my TED Talk about how my bank really tried, and succeeded, in making me angry.

It all starts when I wanted to invest a sum of 15$ in Doge when it was still 0.03$ on Binance. To my disappointment, my card was declined several times so I gave up. The next day my bank called me but I didn't know it was their number and I was partying with my friends so I didn't pick up. A few hours later I realised that my card had been locked, so on my way back from my friend I visisted my bank to have my card unlocked. It turned out that they permanently locked it and there was nothing to be done exept open a new account with a new card. Thats what they said at least. In the end, I didn't invest in Doge at 0.03$.

I think you can understand my frustration when my friend (who didn't know about my crypto adventures) sent me screens of Doge hitting new highs literally every week. Then I forgot about it for a while before I checked the charts again. Doge was 0.55$ per coin. I was FUMING. I tried to buy Doge again, and my card declined AGAIN. So I decided to try again tomorrow. And tomorrow morning Doge was worth 0.71$. I WAS LIVID. In frustration and anger i tried to buy Doge again until my bank called me to ask how dare was I to invest in the crypto market and if anyone forced me to do it. After this annoying conversation they let me do it. I FOMO'd all in into this thing right before the SNL and you can tell what happened.

I know that my bank is not at fault for my financial decisions, but it was my money and I should be able to spend it how the hell I want. It was a mistake, but it was mine to make! And when i think about my possible gains from the 0.03$ Doge... this thought couldn't leave me alone!

Fast forward to june. I was a wiser young adult now, partially because I joined this sub. I transferred my crypto from Binance to Coinbase Pro and swapped all of my Doge into Bitcoin an Eth. And I decided to invest a little mmore, usibg the DCa method of course. So this time, instead of using my card I tried to make a SEPA transfer. Shortly after my bank calls me. They try to prevent me from doing it again, and I have to explain myself to them AGAIN. Fortunately, it went through this time. When I tried to use my card when there was notime to wait for the SEPA to go through i tried using my card. It worked, but only after i had to manually unlock my card using the banks app a couple of times before it went through. Basically every tranfer was pain. And I was still salty about Doge.

They were also calling me at least once a day asking if I wanted to take a loan until I blocked their number.

But the thing that really pushed me over the edge happened only a few days ago. It is not about crypto, but involves coins. I tried to buy a special set of collectors coins from Royal Australian Mint. I was really suprised when my card declined. They locked it, of course and after I manually unlocked it using the app and tried to complete the purchase again before they locked it almost for good. I had to wait for them to contact me before I could do anything about it. They said m purchase was ""suspicious"". I was baffled. It wasn't even crypto, but just some special aussie coins! Pople buy stuff from other side of the world from various sites all the time! I did it all the time! How was this considered suspicious? The whole set was worth 15AUD! Its not like I was buying an expensive yacht! Just let me spend my money in peace bank!

In conclusion, I hate that my bank treats my money hostage for any purchase I try to make. I hate that I have to explain to them that yes, people spend their money in some unusual places sometimes and it is completely normal! It almost feels like I have been deemed somewhat dangerous by them! I'm considering switching banks, though I fear every single one is the same and they will lock my card just the same. Still, it cost me a lot of nerves to make even the smallest purchase and I'm a little fed up with all of this.

And thats all. By writing this post I'm leaving this stuff behind and I'm hopeful that there are green days waiting for me in the future. Thank you for listening to my TED Talk, and fuck the banks.",I genuinely hate my bank,1626644176

CryptoCurrency,"***What is play to earn?***

Hi! To everyone who doesn¬¥t know **what Play 2 Earn is**. Basically, it¬¥s a revolution in the gaming industry, where the users (players) are rewarded with NFTs or Cryptocurrencies for investing their time and/or money in to a game which they can later capitalize on if they wish to.

&amp;#x200B;

***What is the state of the gaming industry as a whole? Is it profitable?***

 On 2020, the gaming market generated about $177 billion in revenue with a growth of 23% from the year before. Reports estimate it to be about 170-200 billion dollars at the moment, and predict it will grow to $280-$320 billion dollars by 2026. In addition to that, it¬¥s currently worth more than the film and music industry and will keep growing at a higher rate than them.

 Netflix in its quarterly earnings report for January 2019 stated that Fortnite may be a bigger threat to its business than HBO which was starting its own streaming service to rival Netflix. But with tens of millions of gamers ranging from kids to adults playing Fortnite and similar Battle Royale games, Netflix has admitted that it no longer views companies providing TV content and video streaming services as its only competition. And they should be worried because online gaming has shifted the attention of their consumer base away from TV shows and movies.

Right now, the **mobile** **gaming** industry is the one growing the most because of the increasing use of smartphones. It contains lots of games with ""microtransactions"" and incentives for people to open the app regularly and lots of adds to earn money from. This, among other things, makes it the most profitable section.

&amp;#x200B;

***How are Blockchains and Cryptocurrencies related to Video Games?***

The crypto gaming scene combines decentralized/Peer to Peer economies and public information regarding the execution of protocols (**smart contracts**) and money flow of organizations, with the concept of **player** **driven** **economies** which is popular in the **videogame industry.** 

&amp;#x200B;

***How do player driven economies work?***

Well, let‚Äôs say you buy / earn (by investing your time) an item which gives you an advantage, cosmetic upgrade, or has some kind of **value** in a game or project's metaverse. In most traditional video game companies, both the money you spend and the time you use to get these objects of value, doesn¬¥t give you any, or at most, little monetary returns unless you compete at a high level, create content on social platforms or sell items for FIAT currencies illegally which demands a lot of work and time.

&amp;#x200B;

***What value does the Play to Earn model give to the gaming industry?***

The **Play** **to** **Earn** model comes to revolutionize gaming. Developers are making games and metaverses, with economies similar to well-established games of different genres including cryptocurrencies, blockchains and NFT¬¥s in to them.

Some implement economic systems with aspects of EVE Online¬¥s, World of Warcraft, Mu Online, RuneScape, Second Life, etc. where players themselves generate resources and have different professions such as vendors, resources gatherers, raiders/monster killers or engineers. Only that now, these objects are given to them in the form of NFTs or token rewards that they can store in their own private wallet.

Others are more lineal and consist of NFT¬¥s staking with extra steps and a marketplace for the assets. One of the most successful projects in that area is ‚ÄúCrypto Blade‚Äù.

In addition to those, there are many Trading Card Games (TGC) such as Unchained Gods and Splinterlands, two famous titles in the crypto-gaming space which let users buy/sell and trade their cards.

Players are **capitalizing on their time/money spent on a game** by having **true** ownership of the assets they get. Although, this works as long as there's a healthy economical ecosystem. There is always the possibility that a mismanaged project crashes leaving it¬¥s community with huge losses.

Even though these systems seem promissing, there will be many games that'll fail to succeed. Some projects will likely suffer from rug pulls and exploits. We are talking about an industry that¬¥s developing applications using cutting edge technology.  It\`s up to the devs decisions and the community/market to decide what games triumph with a well-planned economy and engaging aspects besides money-making to ensure a healthy environment and player base in the space.

&amp;#x200B;

***What is the state of this section of the gaming industry?***

Currently, many projects are popping up, and getting a lot of adoption quickly. You could say that the Crypto Gaming scene is on its own bull run right now.

The most profitable crypto game and the **#1 revenue generating application in the entire crypto industry** is **‚ÄúAxie Infinity‚Äù**, a game which combines unique NFTs with a playstyle that combines many elements of different games like Pok√©mon, and Hearthstone/Hearthstone Battlegrounds. The developers make money mostly by charging a 4.25% Market fee on Axie Sales on their native marketplace and a few other things. In the last 30 days, the marketplace sales generated $420 million dollars in Wrapped Ethereums (221000 ETH). 

Users mine SLP and in some cases AXS, the tokens used in Axie¬¥s ecosystem. SLP (Smooth Love Potions) are used to breed new Axies by using two of them, and AXS is a governance token for the community to have weight in the decisions for the future of the game. It¬¥s used to reward the top 300 players in the PvP ladder when seasons end. 

With the deployment of Ronin, their own blockchain, for their assets due to the game being previously played on Ethereum, they multiplied their daily users from about 10k to more than 500k in months. On the Ronin chain, users can claim SLP, breed and buy / sell their Axies on a feeless blockchain (for up to 100 transactions every 24hs).

In the game, you fight using 3 Axies, which are creatures of 9 different classes that have 6 parts which determines it¬¥s 4 attacks and also give stats and other 2 which only provide stats. There are many combinations and cross-classes axis and an interesting PvP meta which is rebalanced and updated regularly. Also, there are PvE matches, which take from 4 hours at the beginning to about 2 hs after a few weeks in to the game. For doing all of this, you get SLP, the game¬¥s token that is required to breed a pair of axies to create a new one that inherits their genes. There are going to be lands and other new aspects of the game and Metaverse that are in developing right now.

Crypto Blades is drawing a lot of attention as well. It¬¥s token, Skill, is trading at about $25, with a growth of 25.000% since 18/7 when it was going for $1.25. The game is played by making your characters use weapons to fight with a selected enemy by signing a transaction on BSC by paying a fee, and receiving SKILL (the in-game currency) as a reward if they win, if they lose the fight (which rarely happens) they don¬¥t get anything. Players can fight up to 7 times a day with each character and they can have 4 of them for each BSC wallet they use to play. There are 5 classes of characters/weapons that are created for a small amount of SKILL which add some gameplay to the experience. At the moment, Crypto Blade¬¥s ROI is high, with players earning from $50 to thousands on a daily basis. It¬¥s not against the rules to play multiple accounts but users can¬¥t use bots to do it for them. They are going to release many features such as lands and raids also, so they have a long roadmap ahead.

There haven¬¥t been AAA titles (games produced and distributed by a [mid-sized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_publisher#Mid-size_publishers) or [major publisher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_publisher#Major_publishers)) in the Crypto gaming space **up to now**. Most of the games developed in the recent years are poor in design/complexity and aren¬¥t really that entertaining or innovative at all gameplaywise. There have been some like Axie Infinity and Crypto Kitties which did amazing things, though, most of them weren¬¥t and there is a bigger userbase now with more money to poor in to these economies.

This year Is different, we are at the start of something big. Money is flowing into this industry now. At this moment, there are AAA game projects being developed containing **player driven economies,** such as, Illuvium and Guild of Guardians, two promising projects with great teams conformed by high quality professionals.

Also, all across the space there are major investors such as Ubisoft, Samsung, Binance, Moto GP, and others. There are lots of eyes here, this is a revolution in gaming and it¬¥s quite profitable.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

***How I think the space would react to a possible bear market***

Right now, with BTC at almost 50% down from its ATH, the gaming market is growing tremendously. I personally believe that crypto and gaming will keep growing together, even during a bear market (at a much slower pace, and not every project will survive).

Mostly because, during past bear markets, there has historically been little liquidity in comparison to bull seasons giving that the trading of this kind of assets was made in its majority to earn money or move it around in different ways that weren¬¥t so interactive and fun as computer games.

What if good games with an interesting playstyle and player driven economies are able to retain a healthy amount of liquidity during a bear season because they have a reliable player base who truly enjoys playing besides thinking only about the money involved? Users spend huge amounts on projects that keep delivering new content such as WoW, LoL, CS:GO, and many others. 

This market is still really young and a slight separation of game economies from BTC and other trending coins would be healthy and show a ‚Äúmore matured‚Äù space. **I¬¥m not at all saying that it will happen now or that the space is mature enough** for this scenario to become a reality**.** My opinions are based on the information I have and how I would like the industry to evolve. When the bear market comes, lots of gaming projects will die out and in a severe case maybe almost none of them survives. **We have no precedents to study from so it¬¥s all based on speculation.**

I would love to know what you think about all of this UwU

CryptoCurrency,"I know, another post about the mental health but hear me out, please.

As most of you already know, we‚Äôre living in a society that values money. We will do many things for it and sometimes it may result in sacrificing our mental health. This can be a subversive process that is hard to catch in the moment. The absolute paradox of value and money is that the very thing you chase can be the thing that destroys you. Unfortunately, I have chased money on several occasions and in parallel sacrificed relationships, time and most importantly, my mental health. I've lost sleep, jeopardized relationships and undermined my own ethics far too many times to count.
Although my relationship with money has evolved, in my early days I was specifically obsessed about these 3 things:

1.    Not having enough
2.    My friends doing better than me
3.    Others doing better than me

I also started asking these questions:

1.    Do I lose sleep over my crypto positions? (Yes)
2.    Can I go a day without checking the market? (No)
3.    How do I feel when I lose? (Like shit, of course, what did you expect)
 
I realized I have a big problem. My investing habits were destroying my life. After weeks of thinking I came up with these points to get me back on track:
 
1.    Staying away from social media or at least reducing it by a wide margin

2.    Not reading news in the evenings before bed
 
3.    Leaving my phone in another room when I went to sleep.

4.    Taking at least 1 full day per week totally away from all screens, phone, laptop, desktop and otherwise and hitting the mountains

5.    Trading far less.  When I trade less and look at the screen less, I tend to make more money.

Right now, I‚Äôm doing way better and I‚Äôm really thankful for that. I hope some of you might find it useful. Success has nothing to do with how much money you have, it's about the relationship you have with money, people and yourself. If you become paranoid and build a shelter based on fear and obsession - even if you get rich financially you will be the most depressed person alive. 

Good luck out there!",Take a proper care of your mental health. It‚Äôs far more valuable than anything else,1626641455

In addition to that I also applied for a rewards card from Capital One. So now I‚Äôm in a bit of a dilemma. If I use the credit card then I can build my credit history, improve my credit score further, and get 1.5% cash back. If use the Coinbase card I get 4% back on Stellar Lumens (one of my favorite cryptos) or 1% on Bitcoin and I get to use crypto with any purchase which was always my dream since I entered the crypto space.

I wonder which one I should use. If I‚Äôm going to use my Coinbase card for expenses like food then the idea would be to deposit $400 per month (more or less) and use that while getting 4% back on stellar. Problem is that stellar, just like any crypto, fluctuates on a daily basis. I would need to deposit say 20% more to account for a possible 20% drop on price. Good thing is that I have the option to deposit USDC but there are no rewards for that as I‚Äôve seen.

Or I could opt to use my credit card. Price of the dollar is stable, I get 1.5% cash back that I can use to pay down my balance and put towards other rewards, and I get to further improve my credit score. Seems like the more attractive option to me honestly.

A third option: I could use both. Just divide expenses between the two. But for now, other than the excitement of using crypto, it seems more financially beneficial for me to use my credit card.

but technically 
DeFi is short for ‚Äúdecentralized finance,‚Äù an umbrella term for a variety of financial applications in cryptocurrency or blockchain geared toward DISRUPTING financial intermediaries.

DeFi draws inspiration from¬†blockchain, the technology behind the digital currency¬†bitcoin, which allows several entities to hold a copy of a history of transactions, meaning it isn‚Äôt controlled by a single, central source. That‚Äôs important because centralized systems and human gatekeepers can limit the speed and sophistication of transactions while offering users less direct control over their money. DeFi is distinct because it expands the use of blockchain from simple value transfer to more complex financial use cases.

Bitcoin and many other digital-native assets stand out from legacy digital payment methods, such as those run by Visa and PayPal, in that they remove all middlemen from transactions. When you pay with a credit card for coffee at a cafe, a financial institution sits between you and the business, with control over the transaction, retaining the authority to stop or pause it and record it in its private ledger. With bitcoin and more importantly ETH those institutions are cut out of the picture.

i wanted to do an updated review after using my [crypto.com](https://crypto.com) visa card (ruby) as a daily driver for a month:

My original post can be found here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/o8tj4c/as\_a\_european\_a\_cryptocom\_visa\_card\_honest\_review/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/o8tj4c/as_a_european_a_cryptocom_visa_card_honest_review/)

In my linked post ive talked about alternatives pros and cons and the reason i went for crypto.com

**TLDR**  As germany doesnt offer any decent credit / debit card with cashback besides Amazon if u are a heavy shopper. I decided to go into the cryptosphere and binance and [crypto.com](https://crypto.com) are the only decent one available (Still waiting on maybe NEXO).  Decided for the [crypto.com](https://crypto.com) ruby (Why? Check my linked post)

\+ 2% Cashback

\+ 10,63 Cashback in Spotify

\+ Premium feeling metal card

\- u have to stake 350 Euro worth their Currency without interests

\- Cashback in CRO (Can be swapped in any Currency details below)

\- Debit Card u always have to top it up. Takes usually 24h until SEPA arrives

&amp;#x200B;

1 Month with my [crypto.com](https://crypto.com) ive also followed them a bit more. They got some really nice partnerships. One is Formula 1 the other is UFC (If im not mistaken UFC is a 10 years deal.) Im sure this will be a huge way to get more people into crypto. 

Topping up my card usually is no hassle and i just use a template which takes 15 seconds to send the SEPA transfer and 24h til it arrives. I use CURVE as an APP so i can use my Card virtually. All in all my cards works fine virtually and physical. I had a few payments issues in super small shops like backeries and thats why i just carry my regular bank card (i could also use google pay linked to my bank account).

&amp;#x200B;

So far i got regular cashback worth 4 Euros, and additional 4 Euros for normal spendings (Fly ticket, new wallet...) - In germany using my bankcard would gain my zero money back (!)

Cashback is like payback it is instant. 

Ive changed my payment plan in spotify and also received my spotify cashback instantly. Super rat.

I also recommended the ruby card to a few communities on reddit and gained referal money.

&amp;#x200B;

All in all i can say im super happy that im an early adopter to it. I have a set limit to spend money on crypto and i dont wanna increase it. With the cashback and spotify im able to put an extra amount of 15 Euros in crypto every month, for basicly free. Only risk is staking their CRO Coins, but as in every alt coin it can be risky.

Well one big reason is because shilling is very common practice and is done in attempt to positively increase the price of a coin, knowing what you are buying from an unbiased opinion is very important. So to try to help some beginners, I'm going to summarize some of the key points of areas to look at when doing your own research.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Read the White Paper - Arguably one of the most important source for solid information on a project is the White Paper. The White Paper is normally quite technical and long and can be difficult to understand but essentially a white paper is used to describe a problem the project is trying to solve as well as solutions to said problem. The White Paper can also include things like the roadmaps, how funds will be used (important) and the team behind the project. I highly recommend giving the BTC white paper a read also to give you a feel.
2. Research the Team -  Is the team anonymous? If so then do they have a good reason to be? BTC's Satoshi Nakamoto was anonymous and many people believe it is what made BTC able to grow organically without a single figure of authority. However, nowadays an anonymous team is usually not a good sign as many rug pull and scams can occur without anyone being held liable due to anonymity. Always use extreme caution investing in a project with an anonymous team. 
3. Look at the Tokenomics -  Tokenomics is the understanding of the supply and demand characteristics of a cryptocurrency.  We've all seen the shitcoins with a quadrillion supply talking about burning and promises of getting to that sweet sweet 1$ price tag. If you know anything about market cap you know its simply not possible. Dogecoin has an infinite supply and the hopes behind this is essentially that it will be able to maintain a stable price later on in its life, however, we have no idea if this will be the case and is another thing to consider. On the other hand we have BTC with a finite supply of 21,000,000 created via mining. The number of coins decreases by half every four years essentially creating a scarcity driving prices up. One last thing to note is how much of the supply is held by whales and the devs.
4. Social Media - Look them up on social media and check how active they are.  If they are only posting scarcely and have low community interaction  you should do more research as to why this, is it a dead project? 
5. Github (This one is a little more technical) -  A good project goes a long way, but not all work done are made equal. It's important to have a project in the works. This is one of the possible indicators you could use to make sure the team you're hodling for are doing something relevant to their promised road-map 

These are five points I would consider essential in researching when doing your own research, I'm sure there are some thing I have missed that you could mention in the comments below or anything else you would add to this please let me know. Thanks!",How to do your own research,1626638871
CryptoCurrency,"OK, so obviously I need to start this with the disclaimer of nobody knows shit about shit that's gonna happen, BUT, there is also a lot of talk on this sub about double peak bull runs, and in general people seem to think we might have seen a replay of the 2017 peak with and expected 2018 style bump before hitting the true bear market. Obviously there are all sorts of reasons why this wont happen exactly the same and TA is pretty much all bullshit, but things are boring right now so lets play with some ""what ifs"".  

So, looking back at history, if we repeat ourselves exactly, this is what to expect.:

Summer of 2017, Bitcoin was trading around $3400 USD. By early December it reached a peak around $13,000 before dropping to roughly 50% over the next ~4 months. In the spring, BTC got a bit of a second wave and made its way back up to around $7500 in the summer of 2018, and then  crash  over the  fall and winter of  2018 before revisiting  around the $3500 level in the spring of 2019.


If we assume that our preamble to this bullrun was back in the summer /fall of 2020 when BTC was trading around $10,000, our peak of $60,000 this spring  then led to our current price  around $30,000. While the peak this time around was ~6x the preamble vs the 2017 rate of 4x, the current drop is still about  50% which matches  up nicely with the early 2018 drop.  Since our peak was a bit higher this year  we may still have  a bit more dipping to go before the real bounce, but if it does happen in roughly the same manner we might expect to see bitcoin hitting around  $45,000 this fall/winter before dropping back down to around  $10,000 at the lowest of lows in late 2022 sometime.


Clearly this is all bullshit, but its been fun loosely comparing this and last bullrun, so thanks if you actually got this far.","IF we are expecting to see a similar cycle to 2017/2018 (big if), here is what to expect...",1626638850

It might not happen today, this week or even in the next year, but if this is the bear market you're going to lose interest and forget about a lot of things.

In 2014 when the bear came I cashed out roughly half of what I'd been mining and forgot about crypto for a couple of years. Then when I got interested again I couldn't remember shit. I found most of my wallet seeds written down in a notebook.

What I couldn't find though was the seed to [this wallet with 0.05 BTC in it.](https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/18cNTbaDBjC6373M2QcKXusNfyBGYaGc3P?page=1) A relatively small amount in the grand scheme of things, but still enough to piss me off. It's not as if I have the blockchain address bookmarked and I look at it all the time though.

Then in 17/18 it went fucking insane, the ICO mania absolutely had my pants down. I ended up with a decent stash of the top coins but then probably 50+ shitcoins.

Again, the bear came and everyone forgot about crypto and I definitely didn't learn my lesson. Cryptopia getting hacked rekt me and the majority of the other ICO tokens died within a couple of months.

Then in 2020 we go again and yet again I cant remember shit. I'd done a bit better this time as I had most of my stash on a Trezor and a lot of things backed up in a password manager, but there is definitely some crypto with my name on it floating around the universe all lonely.

CryptoCurrency,"I've never been a huge proponent of ""not your keys not your crypto""; I've held crypto on various exchanges since 2015, and I've lost less than a dollar in total on cryptsy thus far (knock on wood). 

A month and a half ago, I saw super lucrative rates for staking on Binance (like 43% for MATIC), and decided to give it a try.

But now, after trying it out for a month and a half or so, I've realized that it's not nearly as good as it seems.

**- You get tempted to buy coins you don't believe in**

I didn't even buy any ""shitcoins"". All the coins I bought were legit; MATIC, DOT, KSM... Even so, and despite being a veteran in crypto since 2014, I should have known better than to buy coins I didn't believe in. Not only is it a bad financial decision, it's also bad psychologically because you get more nervous during dips; I've held my VET from 30k down to 1k back in 2018 and I didn't even bat an eye because I believed in the project. But every drop on a coin you don't believe in really hurts.

**- Your APY is not nearly as high as it seems**

This is the big one. The above would be fine if it wasn't for this. First of all, if you don't actually have the coin and have to buy it, you incur a fee for exchanging whatever coins you do have into it. And then you incur another fee when you exchange it back to BTC or USDT. You might even have to incur double the fees if you were switching from another coin like I did (VET to USDT to MATC/DOT/KSM etc), and if you wanted to switch it out back to say ETH or something which doesn't have a direct pair with your coin, you, again, have to pay double the fees.

The fees aren't huge, but considering you only bought the coins for staking, and most of the high APYs are for 15-day staking... you aren't making all that much money in the first place. Often times, ***you're not even making enough to cover the trading fees***. 

**- Even if you believe in the coin and already own it, the APY still isn't as good as it seems**

The staking periods are 15 days or 30 days or 60 days or 90 days. But in actuality, they hold your coins for another 2 days before the release it back to you. That's 2 days you're not getting any rewards on; if you're doing the 15-day staking, that's 2/17, or 11.7% of the time you're not staking. It's a bit better if you go for the longer options, but even then, you'd have to pay attention and re-stake them asap. 

**- Most of the popular coins are often ""sold out""**

Coins like ALGO, ONE are almost always sold out, so you wont' even be able to re-stake your coins for days or even weeks; that's even more downtime that lowers your total APY.

And often you'll only be able to do the 30-day staking, which gives the lowest rewards, sometimes even lower than if you just staked the coin yourself. 

--------------------
so tl;dr: with all things considered, there are a lot of ""hidden fees"" baked into binance's staking system that inflates its APY, but you won't be able to get anywhere near the advertised amount. 

It's probably better to just stake in your own wallet for a peace of mind and only on coins you actually believe in.",Why Binance Staking is not as good as it seems,1626635974

CryptoCurrency,"I agree with most on this forum that there are far too many BS/meaningless Moon related posts.  Here are my thoughts:

\- We're super, super early in the Community Points game (as evidenced by the 7 figure market cap), where the aftermarket price on derivative tokens (xMoons, xBricks, etc), including any ATHs, is arbitrary.

\- If you're a speculator, like me, this is a 100x or bust bet, with the latter scenario the more likely outcome.  I'm completely aware that this could all disappear with the click of someone's mouse.

\- People on this forum will endlessly debate utility; but taking a step back, Reddit has created a compensation system for micro-form content (comments/engagement).  YouTube has pioneered rewarding long form content creators.  FB and Tiktok are trying to build a system for creators of short form content.  The community points program is probably 3 years ahead of the game.  There's a still a ton to figure out; but at the end of the day what's a rewards/compensation program without tangible value?  

\- The obsession on this forum about short-term price is a freaking joke, as the market is so thinly traded.  Look on Coingecko, the 24hr volume has been under $2K for the past few days!  

For shits and giggles, market experimentation, to spread FOMO and/or FUD, I'm going to commit to match the current 24hr volume in a single buy ($2K USD) on Saturday (7/24) on Honeyswap, regardless of where the price is at.

CryptoCurrency,"Anchor protocol is based on the Terra ecosystem and offers around 20% APY on UST deposits. UST is the native stablecoin of the Terra ecosystem. However, Anchor by itself does not provide any insurance or guarantee of the interest rate, so it is susceptible to 2 types of risks: 

1. Smart contract risk and 
2. Stablecoin Peg loss risk. 

All DeFi platform and their tokens have exposure to various types of risks risks. DeFi protocols have inherent **smart contract risks**, which come into play when there is a bug that can be exploited or if there are any oracle failures or breaches in the protocol. Hacks, funds drained via flash loans are all examples of these risks playing out and people end up losing their money deposited in these protocols. 

**Stablecoin peg risk** occurs when the peg drops below $1 and does not recover. This can also be caused by smart contract failure of the stablecoin's protocol, or by loss of collateral value etc. For instance, the DAI stablecoin's peg could crash if the MKR protocol gets exploited. Recently, Iron stablecoin had lost its peg irreversibly. In Binance Smart Chain, several stablecoins have lost their pegs. Hence, for users of stablecoins in Defi, it makes sense to obtain a peg protection as well if you are considering holding non-trivial amounts in stablecoin.  

The 20% APY that Anchor provides can be considered as a risky return, no matter your trust in Anchor/Terra and its developers. To mitigate these risks, we will look at 2 insurance products that offer smart contract risk protection and also stablecoin peg risk protection. 

**Nexus Mutual Anchor Protocol cover:**

This cover provided by Nexus Mutual offers protection for contract bugs, economic attacks, including oracle failures and governance attacks. In all, this should sufficiently cover for majority of risks associated with the smart contract and defi operations.

[Nexus Mutual Anchor Cover](https://preview.redd.it/cugiitmkj0c71.jpg?width=3096&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=19a909cdcf82e20b9c1d34f125498f5c21024c50)

Nexus Mutual is a prominent player in the defi insurance segment, and has a track record for paying out claims. If the Anchor protocol/smart contract/oracles gets attacked, you can file a claim and get back any funds that may have been lost due to the attack. This insurance is provided at a premium of around 2.6%. I.e for a 1000 USD cover, the premium is around $26 per year!

**Unslashed UST Peg Protection**

The second insurance we will be getting is the UST peg protection by Unslashed finance. As I mentioned earlier, UST is a decentralised algorithmic stablecoin and thus has a peg risk. To mitigate this risk, it makes sense to get a peg protection. Now, it is hard to find stablecoin peg cover for most stablecoins, however UST has been around for a while and is the largest algorithmic stablecoin, and the 5th largest stablecoin in crypto today with a market cap of $2bn and backed by big partners like Arrington Capital, so there is a UST peg cover provided by Unslashed Finance. 

&amp;#x200B;

[UST Peg Cover by Unslashed Finance](https://preview.redd.it/jq17c7c4l0c71.jpg?width=2178&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2a173b1d2f98b53207e3a6c0c19fdb27fe11e823)

The premium for this cover is around 1.41% a year. So for a cover for $1000, it would cost you $14.1 paid in ETH. 

As always, it is advisable to read the policy cover documents. Both Nexus Mutual and Unslashed Finance have detailed policy documents that go into depth and explain the protection offered, and the exclusions. This is similar to obtaining car or life insurance, you need to acquaint yourself with the insurance policy documents and terms.  

So summing up both the insurance policies, to cover a capital of $1000, we will be paying $26 per year for Nexus Mutual's Anchor cover and $14.1 for Unslashed Finance's UST Peg cover. The Total cover = $40.1 per year. The return from Anchor is around 20% (currently 19.5%), so for $1000, you will be getting around $195 a year, minus the cover, your risk adjusted return = $155. 

With this, you have covered both the significant sources of risks in using any DeFi lending protocol, and still continue to earn a decent 15% return on your stablecoin. 

Considering the low yields on other protocols, and the fact that the yield on Anchor can be insured for both common types of risk, this makes a great play for those looking to earn extra on their stablecoin holdings, but also looking for a non-risky approach! This is a great example to show how far the DeFi industry has come in the last year or so, now you can earn interest and also insure it within DeFi itself!","How to earn around 15% return on stablecoin via Anchor Protocol, with full insurance (Both smart contract risk + Stablecoin peg protection).

At first in May, there was a lot of negative metrics like miners capitulation, whale and retail capitulation.

But since the middle of June, miners are accumulating, whales are accumulating, retail is mostly selling but also the number of wallets keeps trending up. In long bear markets, this will not happen.

The current situation looks exactly the same as the middle part of 2013 and 2017. Some boring months and then suddenly the mother of all bull runs out of nowhere.

First it was Elon FUD. Then in the last 3 to 4 weeks, Bitcoin has overcome being banned by the world's most populated country. It only made a slight impact on price. Difficulty adjusted and now miners are relocating and coming back online with renewables.

Remember China also banned Bitcoin in the middle of 2017. These attacks never work on Bitcoin. It always makes Bitcoin stronger, so expect a raging bull run to start soon.

Bitcoin history shows that dip buyers have always won. Dip sellers just end up buying at higher price. So take your opportunity or you will regret later.

My test withdrawal was successful and I followed up with the remainder. The test amount transaction cost .00105 ONE, and .00000005 ONE in gas. The remainder cost the same. In all it was .0021+.0000001. Very quick and affordable so far.

After adding the contract address as a custom token (ETH style) I was able to see my project in Metamask. 
  
Finally I wanted to add liquidity the the token. I decided to take my business to https://ViperSwap.one to pair my token with ONE. I chose ViperSwap because they have a fairly large amount of liquidity across their platform. To approve my token it cost .000099304 ONE, and .000000002 ONE in gas. The second approval cost .000057064 ONE, and .000000002 ONE in gas. To add the supply it cost .00083763 ONE, and .000000002 ONE in gas. Lastly I added the VENOM-LP to my wallet.

CryptoCurrency,"Today, all crytpocurrency networks are maintained through inflation.  Even the deflationary / fixed supply currencies are maintained by the timed release of the supply (despite the fact that there is a hard cap on eventual total supply, the bitcoin supply continues to inflate with each block).

At the current blocksize BTC can handle about 27.5k transactions per block, and nearly all of the block reward is the timed release block reward.  Only a small percentage of the total reward is furnished through fees.

This question applies broadly to all cryptocurrencies with a hard cap, eventually, the computers maintaining the network will have to be paid through only fees, and it remains to be seen if this model is sustainable. 

Can cryptocurrency networks remain sustainable once the inflation rate drops to 0? Or is inflation the optimal solution to incentivize those providing compute power to network security?

Sometimes I feel anxiety when I read a post where someone is sure the bear market is hear and tells me to ‚Äòprepare‚Äô for it. Then I feel scared. 

But then I think about my brother, who always beat my ass when I was a kid, and how certain and belligerent he is even though he talks out of his ass like 95% of the time. I‚Äôve learned by now just to not pay attention to him at all because I know that he doesn‚Äôt know what the fuck he is talking about, but it just makes him feel smart to pretend like it does. 

And that makes me happy again, until the prices drop more, and then I just keep hodling and get worried again, and it‚Äôs pretty much a big cycle. 

Sometimes when I‚Äôm really anxious I talk to my dad (he‚Äôs sold on Btc and eth) and I worry about the price and when it‚Äôs going to go up, and he says ‚Äúwhat are you going to do, sell it like a little paper hand bitch? It‚Äôs gonna go up again someday.‚Äù And then I feel embarrassed, because I guess I know it‚Äôs going to go up someday too, but sometimes it‚Äôs easy to forget and want to sell it all for dollars.

* **Banksocial** \- Promoted by **Faze Banks** on May 27 after which it peaked at high of around $0.000015 and has since fallen to  $0.000000647. Another member, Faze Kay, was also involved (just as he will be in another scam).
* **MILF Token** \- Promoted by Twitch streamer Adinross (4.4m followers). [Clip Here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_V4qr51Mhw&amp;t=437s) Three weeks later he then went on to saying he only did it [for the money](https://clips.twitch.tv/TriangularAssiduousDumplingsDancingBaby-wDwTkDBIEZ-KJR3V) and ""hoped"" none of his fans bought into it.  If one of Ross' fans invested $100 in MILF Token during his stream, they would have approximately $5.80 today. 
* **Titscoin** \-  On April 30, Tana Mongeau posted a video to her Instagram Stories telling people how her stake in this coin bought her a Rollsroyce and that they should get theirs now. If you invested $100 on the day Mongeau claimed her Titscoin investment resulted in the purchase of a Rolls Royce, you would have approximately $0.0000000000000000001664 today. Faze Kay also promoted this coin.
* **Save The Kids Token** \- This has made headlines recently and guess who was involved? You're right Faze Kay. He along with other members of the **Faze clan** and people like **RiceGum** promoted the launch of this token acting as ""ambassadors"". Save the Kids hit as high as $0.04 on launch day. Just hours after that high, it tanked. If you invested $100 in Save the Kids on launch day, it would be worth around $3.39 today.

* Mark Cuban [promoting](https://blogmaverick.com/2021/06/13/the-brilliance-of-yield-farming-liquidity-providing-and-valuing-crypto-projects/) TITAN. It fell from an ATH of $65 to now somewhere near $0.0000008907

CryptoCurrency,"Hey guys! Hope you are not fully bored of these stories, but just wanted to share.

I am 27-year old student, been a crypto believer from somewhere around 2017 when I started my small mining phase. That lasted for 2 years, and I saved majority of bitcoin that I got from mining.

I bought an apartment at the age of 19 with my girlfriend, and after 6 years of living there, we sold it. I invested around 10-15% of my net worth into cryptos after that in the summer of 2020. (Bitcoin &amp; ETH)

Gotta say it has been a rollercoaster ride with this market during the last year. Recently I have noticed the trend of me checking in on my investments multiple times during a day. It has taken a toll on me both mentally and physically. If we had green candle days, I feel like I am on top of the world. If we got red candles, I got scared and thought I should consider selling because I do not want to be left holding the bag, getting too greedy.

I had a solid plan of unloading off 0,5% of my investments everyday, which had appreciated in value around 7x, and I did that for 20 days. Well, the fear of bagholding got me to sell everything in May.

Essentially selling everything doubled my net worth. After that I was able to buy two apartments with my girlfriend to rent out for.  Basically crypto just secured me a rather safe cash-flow for the future.

I do not have any sound advice for you guys who are probably in the same situation that I was in. Just that if we consider the basics of investing (invest only what you can afford to lose) the amount of money in my cryptos got to a point that was so much I wasn't ready to lose.

CryptoCurrency,"I mean, don't get me wrong- exchanges definitely have their place, like spot transactions to turn fiat into crypto while satisfying all the KYC stupidity (neither USD nor physical precious metals have KYC, never will).  But when it comes to doing literally anything else- rudimentary customer service, financial advice, taxation advice, literally anything else...  They are abjectly and demonstrably terrible, with absolutely no help or assumption of any liability when things go poorly, in an ecosystem rife with people incentivized to create poor outcomes.  Even my small, hometown credit union with a meager 3 locations gives rudimentary financial advice, and will insure my deposits ($250K per account) if there's a run or robbery.

Yeah, yeah, most exchanges ""check the box"" and state your funds are insured against a hack or robbery, but if you can't actually call them and ask for help, if you have to *tweet them* to get any semblance of communication weeks later, that's not insurance, that's creative marketing.  They can stake a few million bucks' worth of \[our collective\] coin in a cold wallet and call it ""insurance"" so they can re-class the capital taxes on it (ah- now it's an operating cost doncha know), knowing no one can get to it if they need to.  It's the new fractional reserve lending.  Pagan, spud-less, f\*\*\*ers.

And to be clear- this isn't a call for governance, either.  I don't want governance, I don't want someone to control or correct the bad outcomes or limit my freedom in ***any way***; I just despise the illusion of safety and/or investment professionalism the exchanges flaunt when there is none.

**Monday July 12th**



Ive spent the last 24 hours riding a series of parachutes on the way down trying to nickel and dime where I can. Sold at 2170, bought at 2140, stop loss trigger sold at 2000, bought at 1975, stop loss triggered at 1960, bought at 1920.¬† Eyes on the charts all day trying to take advantage of this dip.¬† Trying to get an idea of where the bottom might be but as of now I dont really know either way.¬†



**Tuesday July 13th**



After spending the last day or so catching a couple parachutes down, I see a massive sell wall begin to form in the 1950-1960 range. The downward trend alongside the sell wall and recent spike in shorts compels me to sell and set a stop loss at 1965.



As the price dips below 1890 I see a large amount of resistance starting to pile up on Bitcoin around 32200 so I set the stop loss at 1895, it triggers, and I walk away happy with the gains.



**Wednesday July 14th**



Wake up to see Ethereum has bounced back to just above 2000.¬† My experience tells me you don't see a 150 point surge without some sort of pullback so I sell my Eth at 2010, I later buy it back for 1985.¬† It feels like it may start to rebound and I dont want to be on the ass end of it.



**Thursday July 15th**



I am super salty today.¬† All day yesterday I sat on my sale at 2010 waiting for things to drop to around 1960.¬† I watched it surge up to 2040 and held my sale position, and then it went down to 1980 or so for an hour or two.¬† I lost my nerve and took the profit at 1982, and within 5 minutes it fell to where I predicted it would fall down to 1960, went to bed just to wake up to it being 1910.



Bah, mother fucker.



Anyway, moving on.



**Friday July 15th**



My fingers got alittle itchy and with weekends more often than not having low volume and slight price drops, I decide to sell at 1925 but I am not in any way confident so I set a super tight stop loss buy back at 1935.¬† It triggers, I took the loss.¬† Bad fundamentals.¬† Bad Dave.



Later that night I swapped my Eth into Bitcoin for a second.¬† Bitcoin was at 31400.



**Saturday July 16**



Sold the Bitcoin at 31950 then bought Eth at 1895.¬† Eth starts to move hot, i watched it shoot up and around 1945 I set a stop loss at 1935 but it continues to shoot right up.¬† I sell eventually yat 1970, however, I get alittle nervous at it rises to 1990.¬† Fundamentals.¬† It should come down.¬† Fundamentals.¬† Stop looking at it.¬† I set up some price alerts to notify me if it drops below 1940 or 1950, or if it goes above 2000.¬†¬†



Shut the laptop, out for the day,

\#Mission Statement

The purpose is to see what I can do with $1000 day trading in crypto. I will be live tweeting each decision as I make it and do a weekly diary update here on reddit.¬†¬†

USD value is not my concern, because I know people only care about USD value I will post it, but my goal is to accumulate total coin.¬† That is to say I want to see if I can make .01 BTC = 1 BTC, not $1000=$30000.¬† It's important to say this because I do not care if the market crashes or pumps, I'm here for the long haul, so my goal is to increase my total held.

Leverage trading has officially been retired.¬† From this point on I will be sticking to spot trading.¬†

\#About Me

I am mid 30s, own a house, married, work from home, semi retired, cars paid off, dog had his shots, no kids, wife has 401k/IRA, and cash emergency funds.

The point, Ill be fine if this fails miserably.¬† Don't stake your decisions on mine.¬† This is for entertainment, it is not financial advice.

I have three other accounts, two hard wallets, that I put my DCA/set it and forget it type crypto into.¬† This is it's own project.

With all that said¬†

Total Trades this Week - 18

\*\*Monday July 12th\*\*

Ive spent the last 24 hours riding a series of parachutes on the way down trying to nickel and dime where I can. Sold at 2170, bought at 2140, stop loss trigger sold at 2000, bought at 1975, stop loss triggered at 1960, bought at 1920.  Eyes on the charts all day trying to take advantage of this dip.  Trying to get an idea of where the bottom might be but as of now I dont really know either way. 

\*\*Tuesday July 13th\*\*

After spending the last day or so catching a couple parachutes down, I see a massive sell wall begin to form in the 1950-1960 range. The downward trend alongside the sell wall and recent spike in shorts compels me to sell and set a stop loss at 1965.

As the price dips below 1890 I see a large amount of resistance starting to pile up on Bitcoin around 32200 so I set the stop loss at 1895, it triggers, and I walk away happy with the gains.

\*\*Wednesday July 14th\*\*

Wake up to see Ethereum has bounced back to just above 2000.  My experience tells me you don't see a 150 point surge without some sort of pullback so I sell my Eth at 2010, I later buy it back for 1985.  It feels like it may start to rebound and I dont want to be on the ass end of it.

\*\*Thursday July 15th\*\*

I am super salty today.  All day yesterday I sat on my sale at 2010 waiting for things to drop to around 1960.  I watched it surge up to 2040 and held my sale position, and then it went down to 1980 or so for an hour or two.  I lost my nerve and took the profit at 1982, and within 5 minutes it fell to where I predicted it would fall down to 1960, went to bed just to wake up to it being 1910.

Bah, mother fucker.

Anyway, moving on.

\*\*Friday July 15th\*\*

My fingers got alittle itchy and with weekends more often than not having low volume and slight price drops, I decide to sell at 1925 but I am not in any way confident so I set a super tight stop loss buy back at 1935.  It triggers, I took the loss.  Bad fundamentals.  Bad Dave.

Later that night I swapped my Eth into Bitcoin for a second.  Bitcoin was at 31400.

\*\*Saturday July 16\*\*

Sold the Bitcoin at 31950 then bought Eth at 1895.  Eth starts to move hot, i watched it shoot up and around 1945 I set a stop loss at 1935 but it continues to shoot right up.  I sell eventually yat 1970, however, I get alittle nervous at it rises to 1990.  Fundamentals.  It should come down.  Fundamentals.  Stop looking at it.  I set up some price alerts to notify me if it drops below 1940 or 1950, or if it goes above 2000.  

Shut the laptop, out for the day,

\*\*Sunday July 17th\*\*

Wake up to price alert hitting.  Bought back the Eth at 1910.

Did pretty well this week.

That's all for this week.

This is an exchange and wallet idea for Latin America, the objective is create an exchange that accept as funding method every local currency of Latam, this is a feature that we haven't seen before, we also want to create an easy to use with academy platform, with all this features we want to impact the whole region, avoiding the unnecessary comissions.

We also want to create a ERC 20 Token that would give to the holders a part of the profits of the entire exchange, every holder is going to be like a shareholder of the profits of the exchange.

CryptoCurrency,"I‚Äôve started seeing posts on here acknowledging that we actually might be in a bear market. I want to tell you that this isn‚Äôt necessarily a bad thing. If you have conviction and believe in the fundamentals for why crypto is valuable in the first place, you know it will go back up.

So if you liked something when it was expensive, shouldn't you like it even more when it's cheap? If you bought BTC at 60k or ETH at 4k, but you're not buying more now, you are investing purely based on emotions. The ones who truly make life changing gains are the ones with true conviction, who keep buying when there's blood on the streets. I know it's a meme but you gotta truly be ""in it for the tech"". You should take this time and truly research what this space is about and the revolutionary technology you're investing in.

If this is your first time investing and you're scared watching all your money go down the drain- I completely understand. I'd be scared too. But that loss is only realized when you sell. Remember this really important fact, everyone who bought the very top of the last cycle are still in the green today. Don‚Äôt make the mistake of selling at the wrong time and miss out on the massive inevitable recovery like many will. Investing is all about having a longer time preference. DCA is always the best strategy starting out.","‚ÄúBull Markets Can Make You Money, Bear Markets Will Make You Rich.‚Äù",1626623199

CryptoCurrency,"I have been thinking about this for sometime and have a couple ideas but also want to hear what you all think. 
I recently got in to crypto like many others, with the thought of making bags of money in a short period of time.  I wanted, and still want to, pay for my kids college educations someday.  I still believe I will be able to do so, but have also learned a significant amount about the tech behind my two favorite crypto‚Äôs (ETH and ADA). 
My mind set has now changed to holding my bags for the long term.  That is made a little easier with my kids only being 5 and 7.  That means in have at least 10-12 years before they are off to college.  
I want to share my new found passion for crypto but have had a hard time getting people excited about it.  I recently stumbled across the game Coin Hunt world.  It is very similar to Pok√©mon go,  earning rewards by traveling to points of interest in your local area.  This game gives free ETH and BTC as rewards for unlocking vaults in your area.  I love it and of course am all in.  I think this would be an easy way to get people involved to DCAing into crypto without have to actually invest.  It is minor amounts of free crypto but the only thing they can lose is time playing the game.

So the post a few days ago about the Coinbase Visa debit card inspired me to sign up for one, but that also got me thinking about how I can use the reward points from my current card on crypto. 

I have one of those 3% reward cards so it is a decent return over time, but currently I can only use it on amazon, or have them send me one of many different gift cards. There is a cash option but I think you can only use it to pay off your card balance. I did some googling but haven't found anything informative about doing something like this.
