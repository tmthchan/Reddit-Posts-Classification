stocks,"Hi,

I'm looking for the best software to track stock trades and create reports to help develop greater insight into what to do, and what not to do, given current market conditions. I've ruled out all websites because they try to get you to pay $80+/month in a never ending subscription. 

No. Way.

The only way to go, without being completely ripped off, is an application that you can install on your computer. I've found one called ""TradingDiary Pro,"" which is $150 to buy, and $50/year thereafter for maintenance. I've kicked the tires a bit, and it looks pretty good. The only problem is that it's a Windows application, so if you've got a Mac, the only way to run it is under Parallels or VMWare.

It's hugely important to have software like this to know what's going well and what's not. It can literally give you an edge. 

I'm using TradingDiary's 30-day demo, and I'm considering buying it. Is there anything better out there that anyone knows about? (Again, please: no websites. They are all massive rip-offs.)

Jacqueline D. Reses has been newly appointed as the executive chairman of Wish. She has previously worked for **Goldman Sachs** in M&amp;A and investments (7 years), **Alibaba**, where she helped lead its IPO (2 years), **Yahoo!** (4 years), **Square** where she managed Square Capital, the company’s start-up small-business lending program.

**Jackie will get a 8-figure net worth if the stock reaches $18-$36 by mid-2023.**

I was doing my research and reading some SEC filings from Wish parent company (Context Logic) and found some golden nuggets. According to an 8-K Form from May, 2021: Jacqueline D. Reses have a not-so-mind-blowing base salary of $35K/year. Keep in mind that her net worth is over $50M.

Let's go back a bit. While Jacqueline has always been wealthy, she built \~90%+ of her net worth by working for Square through performance-based salary (i.e. paid by SQ stocks if financial targets were met). Guess what? **She's doing it again with Wish.** And assuming her net worth is currently at around $60M, she has the opportunity to double it through performance-based vested stocks.

If my calculations are correct, she could double her wealth if the stock price of Wish hits 36$ by mid-2023: *Target of 200% vested \[300%\] \* closing stock price on April 20, 2021 \[$12.07\] = $36.21→ At this price, Jacqueline D.

Today, the market pulled a remarkable reversal and clawed back most of the losses from yesterday, one of the worst days for the three major indexes all year. Despite fears surrounding the coronavirus delta variant and potential inflationary pressures, the volume of buys going into the major indexes yesterday suggest market participants remain unperturbed and eager to buy up any significant dips in the market. If anything, today teaches us not to succumb too quickly to fear, uncertainty, and doubt. Today reinforces the remarkable strength of the markets in the US. Potential risks will always be present in the market, and one always has to be prepared to act in case of a downturn, but one shouldn’t make decisions based on fear. We have seen dips like this in the past before the year, yet the three main indexes continue their monster uptrend. The Russell 2000 (IWM) broke it’s downtrend and outperformed, climbing roughly 3% today. In other news, Q2 earnings season continues and is shaping up to be another record breaking quarter.

Yesterday, it seems fears surrounding the coronavirus delta variant came to a head, with LA county reinstating its mask mandate and the Japanese government reportedly discussing potentially cancelling the Olympics after a slew of infections among athletes and staff. In the US, despite roughly 50% of the population being vaccinated, in the past two weeks, infections across the country have roughly doubled, with cases jumping from 13,200 on July 4 to 32,300 on July 18, according to data compiled by John Hopkins University. However, as I said yesterday, it is important to understand that the rising infections are broadly concentrated in areas with higher vaccine hesitancy. According to data from the CDC, 97% of people who have died or been hospitalized with COVID-19 since the vaccine became widely available are unvaccinated. Dr Rochelle Walensky, Director of CDC said of the rising cases, “There is a clear message that is coming through. This is becoming a pandemic of the unvaccinated. Our biggest concern is we are going to continue to see preventable cases, hospitalizations, and sadly deaths among the unvaccinated.” Sadly, despite the widespread availability of the vaccine in the US, hesitancy in certain places remains very high.

In Japan, things are going from bad to worse with the Olympics. Despite reinstating a state of emergency and banning spectators from attending the events, the games have so far been beset by a slew of infections by both staffers and athletes. Today, the head Tokyo Olympics Committee did not rule out the potential for the games to still be cancelled last minute.

Like I said yesterday, it’s unclear how the situation will play out, but I continue to urge market participants not to panic just yet. While the rising cases are concerning and very unfortunate, on the positive side, the current vaccines have so far proven effective against the delta variant and countries around the world are quickly ramping up their vaccination efforts. But as always, one has to acknowledge the risks that are present in the market. 

Q2 earnings season is shaping up to another record-setting quarter, similar to Q1 of this year. So far, analysts are looking for S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 61.9% year-on-year in aggregate, according to FactSet data – an estimate UBS's Head of Equity Derivatives Research Stuart Kaiser said may still be ""need to be revised higher."" 

A big part of the strong Q2 earnings growth is easy comparisons to the year-earlier period that represented the bottom of the Covid-19 earnings impact. But Q2 estimates also reflect genuine growth, with total index earnings expected to be up +8.8% compared to the pre-Covid 2019 Q2 period. In other words, even when compared to an earnings season 2 years ago, well before the coronavirus pandemic, this earnings season is expected to show very strong growth. Estimates for Q2 and beyond have been steadily going up, with the current +60.5% earnings growth rate up from +50.6% at the end of March and +41.6% at the start of January 2021.

And this yeat have seen my portfolio go from the previous sum to as high as £60,000, back down to £30,000. And within the last 7 days I've lost £3,500 or so day trading. Losing £30,000 didn't kill me. But losing the last £3,500 had.

In the time I've been trading I've invested another £6,000 of my own money on top of the £8,500, probably, and have borrowed £3,000 from the bank to buy an exciting dip in the market, which if I had sold at the high would have made me 40% or so on the trade, from the borrowings. Now I just feel like I'm bleeding money. I'm still up overall fortunately, but my confidence is blown. Whatever I buy or sell I'm just losing.

stocks,"Hi there. I had a couple thought about bond yields, and was hoping someone could confirm/correct me on this thinking. 

1. Bond yields are falling, and have been steadily falling for years. Accelerated decline in yields demonstrates increased demand.

2. People with a brain of their own (as opposed to brain from financial press) know inflation is coming.

3. Bonds do poorly compared to stocks in inflationary periods because their payouts are locked for the buyer based on the price/yield when they buy.

4. Stocks tend to do better in inflationary periods because they maintain their purchase (selling) power.

Conclusion: Smart big money investors are fleeing to bonds to hedge against a market correction/collapse, that they expect to come before inflation really starts kicking us in the ass. With inflation coming quickly, the correction should be expected in the very short term.

Hello investors,

I wanted write a piece about the market conditions right now because recently, a few of the growth stocks that I have mentioned have been performing ""less than ideal"".

These include FVRR, UPST, W, PDD, TTD, FUTU, OZON, TIGR, etc.

These are great businesses with top line growth rates greater than 20% and so much potential to 5-10x in the next 5-10 years.

When I mentioned these names in my previous posts, the valuations were not cheap but they certainly were not ""stretched"". **They were at reasonable premia**, meaning the prices represented a reasonable amount of revenue growth rates, unlike Tesla stock price that was pricing 50% annual sales growth for the next 7 years, which is certainly not reasonable (even Google in their peak growth period grew at 30-40% annually for 4 consecutive years).

The key here is that these stocks were priced at reasonable premia, so as long as these companies achieve certain growth rates, they will be able to sustain those price levels.

The **only** thing that has changed since then is their **stock prices.**

Let's not forget that their businesses are still performing incredibly well. They still have the potential to 3-5x in the upcoming years.

\[large chunk of the memo deleted because it didn't follow the ""guidelines""\]

Right now, I only see the depressed valuation levels as better entry points.

Does that mean stocks will go up in the next month? Obviously not.

In fact, when you invest in businesses, you need to be ready for the stock to go down 50% and stay there for the next three years.

I mean who knows if the Delta variant will bring another liquidity crisis seen in March 2020, or if we'll see another solvency crisis seen in 2008.

My contention is that we won't likely see either. Despite the inflation readings and Fed's talking of tapering, investors are overestimating the hawkishness and the Fed will remain dovish for longer than many expect, providing a continued boost to the risk assets.

Great businesses, however, will shine at some point because the markets can no longer ignore their earnings power.

That's one of the main reasons why private equity outperforms most of the asset classes because there are no short-term price movements that investors or the management are concerned about. More often than not, equity owners in a public company see a decline in a stock price and they immediately call for revised business plan to cut costs and boost earnings, which can dampen the company's growth.

Main point I wanted to get across in today's post is always focus on the business's ability to generate cash flow and diversify your investments, despite what the markets are doing.

As is true for most of the times in history, the chances are low.

\[deleted because it didn't follow the ""guidelines"" of the forum\]

Here's an interesting figure to illustrate my point.

\[deleted because it didn't follow the ""guidelines"" of the forum\]

Again, these are just my opinions. You could very well may have different opinions and I respect that.

Back to the point, remember that the markets follow the earnings growth. If FVRR proves to produce sufficient earnings, the markets will inevitably recognize that and adjust the prices accordingly.

What that means for us is that at current levels of trading multiples, they've gotten cheaper than a few months ago.

Many people ask ""why are the growth stocks going down?"" ""Why are your stocks performing worse?"" ""Should I sell?""

As an investor/trader, you will most likely receive lots of these questions throughout your life and you get used to them at some point.

To them, I answer ""the stock market is only a distraction to your business investments"", a quote I borrowed from some wise investor whose name I've forgotten since.

If you can invest in a great business at a reasonable price, that's all that matters. If you can invest in them at lower prices, even better.

Right now, I only see the depressed valuation levels as better entry points.

Yesterday's thread deserves the logical follow up.  Well, media said Delta caused the market to drop yesterday.    Ok, well, the markets are up nicely today.   How come no financial media outlet is saying Delta is now cured, since the market is just as green today as it was red yesterday?  Because that would be ludicrous to say.  As someone else said, maybe the markets dropped because of the Jamie Spears conservatorship developments.

If it really was Delta that caused the market to drop, the market would drop again today, because Delta is not cured in one day.

Yes, news absolutely moves markets.  But, I will reiterate to ignore all hindsight fluff news that tries to explain events after the fact.  Today, the market is up because there are more buyers than sellers. Not because Delta variant is now cured, which is supposedly why the market dropped yesterday.","UPDATE: If news media had any logical consistency they would now be saying ""The market is up today!

The only thing preventing FDA approval for their latest drug Rolontis was a site inspection that was delayed because of travel restrictions to the Hanmi factory in Korea. Inspection took place 1/6, and so approval should be due any day now. Rolontis is for the treatment of neutropenia in Chemo patients. Currently they like all other drugs were aiming for it to be given the day after Chemo.  However an update now says they believe it is good to give to people 30 minutes after people have had Chemo, which would be more convenient for patients and hospitals alike, saving time and a lot of money. It would allow them to dominate the market, being able to be given just 30 minutes after Chemo treatment. 

In addition they have a second drug designated on the FDA fast track 11/3, so in theory that should be due approval 11/9 or thereabouts, for the treatment of small cell lung cancer, which has reported good results to date.

stocks,"Hey everyone,

There’ve been a lot of phenomenal trackers around WSB, and wanted to give a results-first take on that approach — what I did was create an app that focuses just on what people in this sub are talking about. I’ve built an app to track stocks, automatically pull data and analyze fundamentals. It helps to pinpoint spikes in comment volume for any ticker that is mentioned on the WallStreetBets and other stock related subreddits. If anyone has any feature recommendations, comments, or concerns post here!

Some nifty things this app does:

* View most popular stocks on Reddit
* View mention frequency over time (24hrs - 30days)
* View related posts for tickers on Reddit
* The app automatically filters out mentions created by bots
* Search stock tickers to see the sentiment on reddit
* Notifies when there is a new top stock and when mentions increase or decrease by a certain threshold

You can find all that in [https://apps.apple.com/ae/app/wallstreetbets-tracker/id1551610314](https://apps.apple.com/ae/app/wallstreetbets-tracker/id1551610314)

stocks,"Good morning everyone. I figured this was actually an important topic 

This is very important because it even kind of happened to me on Monday. On Thursday my last entry on NYCB was 11.10. I was trading this a few times from 11.10-11.40.... just this friday.... Monday morning it opened under 11... I felt hey my last sale was 11.30... let me just comfortably set a bid to buy at 11..... it fell to 10.78... I didnt check the level 2's or the charts that also will would have shown selling pressure, instead I used the fact that I was trading it Thursday and sold at 11.30! In my defense, it isnt much of a defense, but I work full time and I trade on my phone. I do not recommend it, however we do the best we can with what we have.

Each day is different, even several hours is different. Interest rates, earnings reports can change things. Also, in general from 12-2PM eastern time is a slow down time. Alot of big banks and firms which account for 80% of trading go out for lunch and stocks that are supported by them may come off a little and you can get a deal! However, the biggest movement is still... 9:30AM-9:45AM and 3:45PM-4PM......

If you made a trade at 10AM... then you can safely make it probably to 12 by copying the same order but after that it is very important to see if there is still the same support via Level 2's, or by graphics the chart.... Trading is in my blood now, it courses thru my veins so without looking at a chart I can actually draw it with candle sticks, RSI, DMI curves based on movement and volume.... however I can not tell Level 2s. So the most important thing for day trading is level 2s!!! Level 2 is 90% and chart is 10%... Over time you will already know what the chart will look like by the stock movement. Yes, it will take time but thats 2nd nature.

The past few days we have tried to enter the same orders on NLS and LAKE... I am trading on phones but I can tell you when the volume builds on NLS, the Level 2s show tremendous buying support in order to drive this from 6.30 to 6.90. It had to have 2-5x more buyers than sellers.....

So in short do not assume that a price/order that was entered yesterday should work for today. Even a trade in the AM may not work in the PM.

If you are doing swing trading, this may make sense..... if you are long term, try not to watch intraday quotes it will drive you crazy!!!",Please do not assume that a price entered yesterday or in the morning will work again the same way,1626781688

The whole truck industry is watching.

While there are already a few electric trucks on the road, none of them have the specs enabling longer range hauling in a class 8 semi-truck, like the Tesla Semi is promising.

When launching Tesla Semi in 2017, the automaker said that the electric truck’s production versions, a class 8 truck with an 80,000-lb capacity, will have 300-mile and 500-mile range options for $150,000 and $180,000, respectively.

It would also have the lowest cost of operation of any semi-truck, making it extremely disruptive in an industry where every cent counts.

However, the electric vehicle has seen many delays that cost it its momentum.

When unveiled in 2017, Tesla said that it would come to market in 2019, and it started taking reservations from many companies looking to electrify their fleets.

Tesla couldn’t deliver the truck in 2019. So it was delayed in 2020, which became 2021, but now things are really starting to move.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

\&gt; Heat wave! Climate change! Market goes down. Ooops, when that was the news, the market went up. Condo collapse! Market goes up. Europe flooding! Market goes down. Nope, it went up. 

Every event does not have the capability to influence the market. Who exactly said these events are equal in scale to a multinational shutdown? Are we really surprised the condo collapse in Miami didnt effect the market? 

\&gt; Delta variant has been in the news for months, and NOW the market goes down because of Delta? Maybe yesterday the market went up because of Delta. Just as stupid.

again, the argument that its been in the news before therefore it can't effect the stock market. Why ""NOW""? *48 states are now seeing new case numbers rise at least 10% higher than the previous week.  Coronavirus-related hospitalizations have gone up, rising 35.8% between July 7 and July 13 compared with the previous week.* These things effected share prices just last year. 

Keep in mind these news agencies have contacts and sources that work on Wall Street. I would be willing to bet they asked them about this drop (in fact, some articles quote them). Also, the stocks that went up today are the ones whose model works well with a shutdown like Etsy and Pelton, both had a good day. Just like they did during early pandemic days. And shares for companies that benefit the most from an open economy did poorly. The articles say this btw. They also mention other potential factors like inflation. 

\&gt; Ignore all news. The market dropped because there were more sellers than buyers. The scapegoat just happens to be some arbitrary event. 

Theres typically a reason/reasons for these large movements. Perhaps the market overreacted but legitimate fears of more lock downs isnt some ""arbitrary event"" thats just happening in the background and disconnected from the worlds economy. The Miami condo example they provided is an ""arbitrary event"". The comparison of these things is baffling. And i dont even know what to think or say about the scapegoat part.

People who dared question whether insane profits off of mortgage bonds were sustainable were told, frankly, to shut the f\*\*\* up.

I was reading a book recently that takes place post-Spanish Civil War. The bullies came out on the side of the fascists to beat up the ""f\*gs"", the commies, and the degenerates, all in the name of upholding the good social order.

They're the ultimate cowards, because as soon as the tide turns against them, you'll find them go into hiding until they can find some other supposedly righteous cause to use to express their hatred.

I'm not saying the market is going to collapse, nobody knows if that will happen or when, but the bullies love to come out and play in an environment when things appear to be going well. Dissent is mocked and belittled, because hey, look at the profits. Look at the charts. If it's going up, you must be a dumbass to think otherwise.

Dissent is healthy. If you think bears are stupid, then ignore them, or refute them. Anyone who believes that dissent is silly, the Catholic Church could have used you in the Middle Ages.

stocks,"The last couple of days have been very tough. The Nasdaq down nearly 200 each day 1.5%. Honestly, it is surprising because for the most part earnings have been very good. GS, JPM, BAC, PACW, AN alot of companies coming with amazing numbers..... VOXX blew out top and bottom and was crushed!

Unfortunately, if you thought Friday was a dip… wow today! It is just very hard to time it, like the most of us...(we cant time it perfect), you found yourself buying the dip all day long! Yesterday for instance, I bought TIGR at 18.50 at first dip, thinking this was a steal it was just nearly 21.... then at 17.25... I told the elite group this is ridiculous I am going in..... I also mentioned today with examples why if I went completely defensive every single trade would have been green, but instead I was faked out by new highs on the market indexes.

So what we should do is buy what I call super defensive stocks which pay dividends anywhere between 8-10%. The reason being is when money flows from tech that alot of money will seek a safe haven. There is nothing more safer then a company that pays in cash 8-10% a year of the initial cost of shares. Unfortunately, as the stock price rises the yield comes down, which means if everyone follows this strategy we all cant win....unfortunately, the truth is on almost every trade there is a winner and a loser.... When you sell a stock you are doing so because you believe it is a higher and you can buy it again cheaper, or at a later date. When you buy a stock you are thinking you are getting an opportunity of a lifetime.

The reason we dont follow this principle always is because those stocks are not volatile and you are not able to make a lot on these trades. PSEC moves 20 cents a week.... TIGR moves 20-25% a day sometimes. Timed right TIGR is both a gift and a curse....

If things get bad. We must change strategy.","When the market gets very tough/choppy and turns red, sometimes our best strategy for trading is to go with what I called super defensive.",1626746846

The shares you buy are voteless Class C shares which can be upgraded to normal one-vote Class A shares on a case by case basis. In other words, Robinhood tells all the corporate raiders to bug off.

The growth of the company has been huge. Revenue [growing by 309%](https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/how-robinhoods-explosive-growth-rate-came-to-be/#:~:text=The%20fintech%20unicorn's%20revenue%20grew,a%20gain%20of%20around%20309%25.) between 2019 and July 1st. The amount of hate mail they get, poor reviews, SEC fines, growing competition from other low-commission brokers, and at least one guy indiscriminately assaulting Robinhood employees this past year has not stopped new accounts from coming in. From 7.2 million in March 2020 to 18 million [as of July 1st.](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/01/robinhood-has-18-million-accounts-managing-80-billion-after-rapid-one-year-growth-ipo-filing-shows.html) This growth has occurred despite many veteran users leaving the platform.

The reason for these trends can be found by how the average Robinhood user is:

1. 31 years old.

2. Has an account size of $4,500 (compared to E-Trade's $100,000).

3. Is a buy-and-hold investor (only 2% of accounts are flagged PDT).

4. Has 2 positions.

5. Did not have any investment account before Robinhood.

You see how Robinhood has become the Walmart of Stock Brokers, making money off economies of scale and the least common denominator. Robinhood's easy to use platform should continue to be millions of young people's first introduction to stocks for many decades.

Another point is Robinhood is now offering early IPO access. This is where they, as an institutional investor, buy large blocks of IPO starter shares and immediately resell them for a little more to their clients. The benefit of this is normally small orders don't have a chance of getting filled during an IPO.

One oddity from this is that Robinhood is, AS OF THIS MOMENT, offering their own shares on the app. The funny thing is, the many Robinhood users here can be sure your buy order will be filled during the IPO because their broker is making a huge amount of money selling you shares and if nothing else they can create more shares in order to sell them to you. I don't know for a fact they are planning to do that, though.

stocks,"**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, July 19, 2021**

The market sank today, with all three major indexes falling, the largest overall drop in at least two months. The market gapped down after the remarkable rally in mega-cap technology stocks, which had been driving the market higher, paused. It seems the market is being pressured by concerns surrounding inflation and rising concerns of a resurgence of coronavirus infections among the unvaccinated caused by the highly contagious delta variant. Q2 earnings season rolls on, with more big banks and industry-leaders like Johnson and Johnson (JNJ) and Netflix (NFLX) reporting this week. So far, earnings have been encouraging but have so far not impressed Wall Street. 

Since the release of the June Consumer and Producer Price Indexes (CPI &amp; PPI), which showed price inflation growing at a higher than expected clip, the market has become increasingly volatile, not unlike what happened in mid-May, where the SPY lost roughly 4% in two or three days. The CPI, which measures changes in the prices of consumer goods, rose 0.9% in June, accelerating from May’s 0.6%. Year-on-year, the CPI is up 5.4%, exceeding the 4.9% expected by economists and the fastest rate of growth since 2008. Core CPI, which excludes the volatile price energy and food and is therefore considered a more accurate representation of general price inflation, was up 4.5% year-on-year as prices bounced from last year’s pandemic-era lows. PPI, which measures the average changes in prices received by domestic producers for their output rose 1% in June, accelerating to a 7.3% rise year-on-year, while still reflecting base effects. Core PPI rose 5.5%. This is the fastest rate of increase since 2009. 

Concerns about the coronavirus delta variant are rising across the globe. Recently, Japan reinstated a state of emergency and banned all spectators from attending the Olympics, which are kicking off soon. In the US, despite roughly 50% of the population being vaccinated, in the past two weeks, infections across the country have roughly doubled, with cases jumping from 13,200 on July 4 to 32,300 on July 18, according to data compiled by John Hopkins University. In response, LA country reinstated its mask mandate, with other places in the US expected to follow suit. However, it is important to note that infections in the US are concentrated in areas with higher vaccine hesitancy. According to data from the CDC, 97% of people who have died or been hospitalized with COVID-19 since the vaccine became widely available are unvaccinated. Dr Rochelle Walensky, Director of CDC said of the rising cases, “There is a clear message that is coming through. This is becoming a pandemic of the unvaccinated. Our biggest concern is we are going to continue to see preventable cases, hospitalizations, and sadly deaths among the unvaccinated.”

It’s unclear how the situation will play out, I urge market participants not to panic just yet. While the rising cases are concerning and very unfortunate, on the positive side, the current vaccines have so far proven effective against the delta variant and countries around the world are quickly ramping up their vaccination efforts. But as always, one has to acknowledge the risks that are present in the market. 

Last week, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell gave his semi-annual monetary policy testimony before Congress, where he largely reiterated the same thing he has been saying for months. Powell said “inflation will likely remain elevated in the coming months before moderating” and that the US economy was “still a ways” off from reaching the threshold of “substantial further progress” that would trigger the Central Bank to roll-back pandemic-era policies. In short, Powell basically said while he expects higher inflation prints in the coming months, pressures are transitory and due to pandemic era disruptions and the Fed’s goal for economic recovery have not been met. [Here is Powell’s complete testimony, but here are two of his most important quotes.](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/testimony/powell20210714a.htm)

**On the labor market:** “Conditions in the labor market have continued to improve, but there is still a long way to go. Labor demand appears to be very strong; job openings are at a record high, hiring is robust, and many workers are leaving their current jobs to search for better ones. Indeed, employers added 1.7 million workers from April through June. However, the unemployment rate remained elevated in June at 5.9 percent, and this figure understates the shortfall in employment, particularly as participation in the labor market has not moved up from the low rates that have prevailed for most of the past year. Job gains should be strong in coming months as public health conditions continue to improve and as some of the other pandemic-related factors currently weighing them down diminish.”

**On inflation:** “Inflation has increased notably and will likely remain elevated in coming months before moderating. Inflation is being temporarily boosted by base effects, as the sharp pandemic-related price declines from last spring drop out of the 12-month calculation. In addition, strong demand in sectors where production bottlenecks or other supply constraints have limited production has led to especially rapid price increases for some goods and services, which should partially reverse as the effects of the bottlenecks unwind. Prices for services that were hard hit by the pandemic have also jumped in recent months as demand for these services has surged with the reopening of the economy”.

In other news, Q2 earnings season rolls on. As of today, roughly 8% of companies in the SPY have reported, with 85% of those beating expectations, according to FactSet. It seems like this quarter is shaping up to be another record-breaking season, with corporate earnings super-charged by rising demand from savings-laden consumers.

I'm sure some of you have already heard (or use) [TIKR.com](https://TIKR.com). They recently launched their global equity screening tool and it is fantastic. 

One of my favorite things about the screener is that it scans every global market, which is something you don't find in a lot of online screeners. 

What is everyone's favorite screen to run? One of my favorites is looking for high growth stocks that are trading at a reasonable valuation (GARP). 

I like businesses that have grown revenues at a 5%+ CAGR, FCF at a 10% CAGR, and trade at less than 30x NTM P/E. 

Currently that screen yields 690 results in TIKR.

stocks,"I have been investing for the better part of 10 years now and into swing trading for the last 3 years. I have been a bull almost my entire time investing, with the exception of a few of the black swan events we have had.  I feel that I have a pretty high risk tolerance and typically do not even hedge my long positions. However, my hypothesis is that we will soon see a steep stock market correction. To be fair my hypothesis is pretty narrow and does not account for the countless factors that drive the market. My hypothesis is that we are early in the 4th wave of COVID.  I am a physician assistant and I work in an urgent care and two ERs in Louisiana.  I can tell you that all of my colleagues and I have been seeing a marked increase in COVID cases in the last 3-4 weeks. Even more so last week.  I can tell you hospitals in my are near capacity and almost all are on hospital wide diversion (meaning they aren't accepting noncritical transfers). Looking at the national and Louisiana new case rate you can see small uptrend in cases in the last few weeks, but keep in mind this data is delayed. It does not account for the most recently cases ( I believe it is delayed by a week or two). I believe that this is the beginning of the 4th wave and soon we will see numbers like we did back in November-February.  Counter point obviously is vaccination. Unfortunately, Louisiana does have some of the lowest vaccination rates in the country, at around 39%. Nationally the vaccination rate is around 48% fully vaccinated. I spend so much of my time trying to educate, but it seems that most of the people that wanted to get vaccinated already have. I don't see a drastic uptick in vaccination rates especially in southern states where conspiracy theories run rampant.  I ask every single patient that I diagnose with covid if they have been vaccinated and I can tell you about 8-10% of my patients are vaccinated. The vaccine obviously provides protection, but I fear that at under 50% is not high enough. Additionally, covid fatigue is a real thing. I know most people are tired of hearing about it. Our guard is down. I am not sure how it is in the rest of the country but, in my state everything is pretty much 100% open and back to normal. No one wears masks in public anymore and I do not see that changing unless a masks again become required to enter businesses (as of now they are not my area).  People are back to gathering in large groups.  I believe this is the prefect situation for us to see a rapid increase in new case rates leading to the 4th wave. Now here is where it gets more complex. Once we are in the fully into our 4th spike what will happen? Do we have massive lockdowns again, restaurants, bars, schools etc closed. If so I think so we will see another big dip in the market. Or do they simply recommended masks use in public places. If this happens I'd imagine we still have  a dip from covid case spiking fears, but not as much as if we are locked down again.  I do realize my hypothesis uses a lot of information from my first hand accounts and may seem to others to be short sighted. That is why I would like to hear form you and see your feelings on the upcoming 3,6,12 months.  As for me, I am bearish at least in the short term. 

&amp;#x200B;

Disclosure: I hold only long positions at this time. I am not short any individual stocks, options, or indexes at this time, but am considering going some short SPY positions soon.

TLDR: I work in healthcare and in my opinion we are in the early part of the COVID 4th wave. Question is how will the market react.

Bought back nearly $9 billion of its own shares in 2019.

No share repurchases were made in 2020 and no shares have been repurchased through February 2021. As of February 2, 2021, Pfizer’s remaining share repurchase authorization is $5.3 billion. Current 2021 financial guidance does not reflect any share repurchases in 2021.

In 2020 Pfizer's sales popped 2% to $41.91 billion. That excluded the Upjohn unit, which Pfizer merged with Mylan to create Viatris (VTRS). The Upjohn business housed Pfizer's older drugs, including those facing generic competition. Negligible BNT162b2 sales in 2020. Decision to divest its off-patent division should result in faster growth. 

Strong cash flows generated from a basket of diverse drugs.
 
Large size confers significant competitive advantages in developing new drugs as well as economies of scale, strong R&amp;D capabilities.

Its innovative biopharma business includes growth drivers such as Ibrance, Eliquis, Vyndaqel, Xtandi, Xejanz and Prevnar13 as well as a robust pipeline of biologics. 

Pfizer is now launching several potential blockbusters in cancer, heart disease, and immunology. cardiovascular drug Vyndaqel is a potential game-changer in the rare disease area.


Threats-

Facing pressure since President Joe Biden and U.S. Trade Representative Ambassador Katherine Tai voiced support for waiving the patent rights protecting Covid vaccines.

Concerns have also emerged that the Covid vaccines using messenger RNA technology could be tied to heart inflammation in people younger than age 30. Studies conducted on vaccines from Johnson &amp; Johnson and AstraZeneca show no link between these vaccines and similar heart conditions.

In January Pfizer stock tumbled close to 3% on a single day after the company said rheumatoid arthritis drug Xeljanz failed to outperform a rival medicine in a post-marketing study.

Covid-19 vaccines work too well.

Pharma legislation, competition, lawsuits - all the usual suspects.


Covid-19 -

PFE's COVID-19 vaccine, BNT162b2, uses messenger RNA technology or mRNA, which tells the body to make a single spike protein, mimicking the outside of the virus.

Has increased its guidance for BNT162b2 revenue to $26 billion from $15 billion and lifted its EPS guidance on May 4, 2021. 

Both Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech are negotiating new contracts and remain best positioned to develop the first vaccines against new variants. Moderna has released the first data for a third dose with its mRNA-1273.351 variant vaccine that imply stronger and more consistent protection across variants and Pfizer expects data from its own variant vaccine in July. Pfizer also noted that future variant vaccine updates may only need a lead time until regulatory authorization of roughly 100 days.

Pfizer is scaling up manufacturing to meet its commitment to deliver billion doses of its coronavirus vaccine by the end of 2021.

Expect COVID-19 vaccine sales will create very strong growth in 2021, but likely weigh on growth by 2023 as competitive vaccines erode pricing and demand for Pfizer's vaccine. 

Expect improved bottom line on increased annual revenue over the next three years as cost-cutting plans and share buybacks (currently paused) take shape.

BNT162b2 was granted an emergency use authorization (EUA) in the U.S. in December 2020.

Instead of mRNA, China’s leading vaccine makers, state-owned Sinopharm and private firm Sinovac, rely on inactivated vaccine technology and their effectiveness is poor especially against the Delta variant.  CCP sponsored unfounded concerns and negative reviews around mRNA. CCP vaccine diplomacy failing miserably as Chinese non-mRNA vaccines are maybe 50% effective.   

Variants of concern — 
Alpha - Britian - ~ twice as contagious as the original
Beta - South Africa
Gamma - Brazil
Delta - India - about 60 percent more contagious than Alpha

The FDA has said Pfizer can transport and store their BNT162b2 at more standard freezer temperatures.

Testing out a booster to the original vaccine. From a PFE financial perspective, they would benefit if booster doses are needed.

Effectiveness against Delta variant, the most contagious variant, seen at 64% in Isreal and about 71% almost everywhere else.

FDA 

Submitted applications for full approval vaccine (Biologic License Application) to the FDA on May 7, 2021.
Full approval expected within 6 months typically, so latest expected approval 11/7/2021, unsure now; FDA (7/15/2021) set January 2022 target to decide on approval of Pfizer's COVID-19 shot for those at leat 16 years old although noted highest priority and earlier possible.
Full approval allows their Covid vaccine to stay on the market after the pandemic ends and PFE could also market directly to consumers and change the vaccine's price.

On May 10, the FDA authorized the companies' Covid vaccine for emergency use in teens ages 12-15. European officials followed on May 28.

In September, Pfizer expects to have the test results of its Covid vaccine in children ages 2-5 and 5-11. It will then ask for emergency authorization for those groups. In November, the company expects to have data from tests in children age 6 months to 2 years.

The possible need for booster shots could further extend vaccine sales.

Per FDA, emergency authorization for Covid-19 vaccines in children under 12 could come in early to midwinter. The agency hopes to then move quickly to full approval of the vaccine for this age group.

Study published in the Lancet Microbe found PFE vaccine showed 10 times more antibodies than the Chinese one from Sinovac.
The U.S. vaccine program has all but stalled with just 48.3% of the population fully inoculated and cases are rising in the U.S. again and have more than doubled in the last two weeks. The average daily case rate stood at 28,315 on 7/15/2021.

7/13/2021
Meets with top U.S. health officials yesterday to discuss the authorization of a third dose of its COVID-19 vaccine. Biden’s chief medical adviser acknowledged that ""it is entirely conceivable, maybe likely” that booster shots will be needed.  Health officials need to see more data to know if additional shots could raise people's risk of serious side effect. The second dose for two-shot COVID-19 vaccine regimens was associated with higher rates of side effects.

PFE's booster study suggests people’s antibody levels jump five- to 10-fold after a third dose, compared to their second dose months earlier.

Currently only about 48% of the U.S. population is fully vaccinated.

7/12/2021
RBC Capital  increased the target price from $43 to $44 and reiterated a Hold rating.

In early July PFE disclosed it's developing a specific vaccine to tackle the Delta variant.  Hopes to start testing in August.

PFE is also testing a third dose of its vaccine as a booster shot.

In the Europen Union 77 million doses of Pfizer’s Comirnaty and 20 million doses of Moderna’s Spikevax vaccine had been administered as of May 31. 

Israel became the first country to offer boosters, authorising third doses of the BioNTech/Pfizer shot to adults with serious pre-existing medical conditions. Other countries are considering whether and when to follow suit.

Some expect that booster Covid shots will be necessary in the years to come as the virus continues to circulate, much like with influenza, for which annual revaccination is required.

Researchers are increasingly encouraged by breath tests that can detect Covid-19.

The Food and Drug Administration is adding a warning label to the Johnson &amp; Johnson Covid-19 vaccine following reports of 100 cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome in vaccine recipients. Ninety-five of those cases were serious enough to require hospitalization and one person died.

Pfizer said that it planned to ask the FDA for emergency approval for a third dose of its vaccine and that it was working on a shot that offered more protection against the Delta variant. PFE noted that vaccine efficacy MAY decline six months after immunization. Scientists were critical of the announcement, pointing to evidence that the current two-dose regimen is powerfully effective against the coronavirus. 
FDA and CDC responded that fully vaccinated people generally did not need boosters — yet.

From May 15 to July 12, of the 29,380 COVID-19 cases reported in Ontario, 83.2 per cent had not been vaccinated at all and 15.6 per cent were partially vaccinated. About 1.2 per cent were fully vaccinated. 

United Kingdom is suffering another major coronavirus outbreak. There appear to be both outbreaks in clusters of people who are not vaccinated yet and also a significant number of breakthrough infections that got past the vaccine — though importantly, vaccination still seems to prevent almost all serious illness. The U.K. has mostly used the AstraZeneca vaccine, which is not as good as the Pfizer and Moderna versions used for most American inoculations.

Brazil approved a new clinical trial of a COVID-19 vaccine candidate to be developed and tested by Sanofi Pasteur, the vaccination division of French pharmaceutical giant Sanofi. The phase 1/2 trial is also expected to take place in the United States, Honduras and Australia.

New Zealand has approved use of the Johnson &amp; Johnson coronavirus vaccine, after earlier in the year approving the Pfizer vaccine. But New Zealand is staying with its plan of primarily using the Pfizer vaccine to inoculate the population of 5 million.

South Korea is in talks with mRNA vaccine makers including Pfizer and Moderna to produce shots in the country and is ready to offer the capacity to make up to 1 billion doses immediately, a senior government official said.

5/4/2021- 1st Quarter 2021 reported
1st Quarter 2021 revenues of $14.6 billion, up 42%.
Adjusted diluted EPS of $0.93, beating the consensus estimate by $0.15 and rising 47%. 
GAAP net income was $4.877 billion or $0.86 per diluted share, compared to $3.355 billion or $0.60 per share.

COVID-19 vaccine sales are providing a major lift to sales and earnings in 2021 and likely into 2022.

Total sales increased 42% (up 8% excluding COVID-19 vaccine sales)

COVID-19 vaccine sales contributed $3.5 billion in the quarter and are guided to be almost $26 billion in 2021, above previous guidance of $15 billion and ahead of our $23 billion estimate. 

Top drugs Eliquis (cardiovascular),Vyndaqel (rare disease) and Xeljanz (immunology) all posted strong gains based on leading efficacy driving market share gains. 

Cancer drug Ibrance fell 1% as economic hardships (likely related to the pandemic) are increasing the need for Pfizer assistance programs, but this should reverse as the pandemic eases.
 
Pneumococcal vaccine Prevnar fell 57% in U.S. adults, where guidance against co-administration with COVID-19 vaccines pressured results, but a new co-administration study of nextgeneration Prevnar 20 with the COVID-19 vaccine (data later in 2021) should help reinvigorate the franchise.

Excluding Revenues for BNT162b2 of $3.5 billion, revenues grew 8% operationally including a negative 5% impact from pricing.

Raised full-year 2021 guidance for revenues to a range of $70.5 to $72.5 billion and adjusted diluted EPS to a range of $3.55 to $3.65, primarily reflecting updates to anticipated contributions from BNT162b2 partially offset by additional R&amp;D expenses for vaccines to protect against COVID-19 as well as other mRNA-based development programs and COVID-19 antivirals.

Now anticipates revenues of approximately $26 billion for BNT162b2, reflecting 1.6 billion doses expected to be delivered in 2021 under signed contracts as of mid-April 2021.

Enters into contracts to supply BNT162b2 to Canada and Israel for periods beyond 2021; ngotiating similar potential contracts with other countries.

Maintains quarterly dividend for second-quarter 2021 at $0.39/share; dividend will not be reduced as a result of the initiation of a quarterly dividend by Viatris Inc. 

2/2/2021 - 4th Quarter 2020 and Full Year 2020

Quotes from the earnings release -

In the fourth quarter, achieved double digit operational revenue growth driven by a wide range of products and geographies, including growth within all of our therapeutic areas.

Guidance -
The midpoint of the guidance range for revenues represents 44% growth from 2020 revenues, including an expected $1.4 billion, or 3%, favorable impact from changes in foreign exchange rates. The midpoint of the updated guidance range for Adjusted diluted EPS reflects a 42% increase over 2020 actual results, including an expected $0.09, or 4%, benefit due to favorable changes in foreign exchange rates.

Financial guidance for Adjusted diluted EPS is calculated using approximately 5.7 billion weighted average shares outstanding, and does not currently assume any share repurchases in 2021.

Revenues for BNT162b2 approximately $15 billion, contributed $154 million in sales in the fourth quarter.

The BNT162b2 revenue projection incorporated within Pfizer’s 2021 financial guidance primarily includes doses
that are expected to be delivered in 2021 under existing contracts, and may be adjusted in the future as additional
contracts are executed.

Guidance for BNT162b2 incorporates the current expectation for revenues for the product, less anticipated Adjusted costs to manufacture, market and distribute BNT162b2, including applicable royalty expenses and a 50% gross margin split with BioNTech, as well as shared R&amp;D expenses related to BNT162b2 and costs associated with other assets currently in development for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.

*This list is geared towards day trading. With the momentum watchlist especially, I am typically in and out very quickly, only occasionally longer than a couple minutes, usually faster scalps.* Always have a plan when you enter a trade (for profit taking and for taking a loss), and use proper risk management for your account.

**Main Watchlist:**

Gapping UP:

* FIVN: Gapping up over relevant SMA's. Could find potential support around 188, I'll be watching price action around that level. If it holds up, it could see more upwards movement.
* FLOW: Looking to open at new ATH after this large gap up. Potential premarket support at around 77. I'll be watching for potential shorting opportunities, as I think it could get over-extended. 
* UVXY: Worth keeping an eye on this if we see more selling off. I suggest getting in and out, as it can be risky to hold over the course of multiple days. 

Gapping DOWN:

* TSLA: Currently gapping down below the SMA(200), looking to open around the SMA(50). Could see more downwards movement if it can't hold up over 627. 
* AAPL: Daily chart was looking extended, and now gapping down below SMA(9). Could retrace to SMA(20) if it continues to show weakness (\~139.57). 
* BA: Gapping down below SMA(200) after breaking down below it and 220 support on Friday. I'm taking this as a bearish indicator, but it could potentially find support around the 210 level. If it breaks down below 210 and cannot recover, I'll be looking for short opportunities. 
* UAL: 44 could serve as a key level. If it can get back above, I'll be looking for opportunities to go long. If it rejects that level, I'll be looking for shorting opportunities down towards 42, maybe even 40. 
* CCL: 20 could serve as a resistance level, with 19 and 18 as potential support levels. 
* BABA: Gapping down below relevant SMA's. 210 could serve as resistance level, I'll be watching for shorting opportunities and a retrace towards the 200 level. 
* NIO: Currently looking to open below relevant SMA's. I'll be watching price action around 41.25 (SMA(100)), could provide shorting opportunities if it continues to show weakness. 
* CPE: Gapping down below SMA(100) after testing that level in Friday's trading. I'll be watching for shorting opportunities back down towards the support level of 36 if it continues to show weakness. 
* MP: 32 could serve as a resistance level. Potential support levels at 30 and 28. 

**Market Outlook:**

Stocks are looking to open lower this morning, as earnings season is set to heat up this week. We've seen concerns about growth slowing, inflation, and COVID, and we are seeing some selling off this morning. Multiple indices are looking bearish (according to my own TA), so I'm going to proceed with caution today. It could be a good day for shorting opportunities. SPY is trading a bit over 426, and things are looking pretty bearish on the daily chart at the moment. We could see more downwards movement towards the SMA(50) (\~423). DIA is trading a little under 342, and gapped down below the significant support level around 345. Could find potential support at 340, or retrace to the SMA(100) at around 337.25. QQQ is trading just over 354, and could see more downwards movement, particularly if it can't get back up and hold over 355. Gold and silver are down at the moment, with crude oil sliding even further. Marijuana stocks continue their recent weakness and are down as well. Meme stocks are not immune to the weakness we are seeing this morning, and are down as well. 

Not much strength in the market this morning, and we could be in for more volatility and indecision. Stay disciplined in your trading and don't force trades. There will be opportunities, even on a day like this. Especially on a day like this. 

Remember to use proper risk management, by making sure you size appropriately for your account and have a plan for every trade you enter (both for taking profits and cutting losses). Happy trading everyone :)","Morning Update for Monday, 07/19/21",1626699526

stocks,"Hi gang,  


Wondering if anyone can shed some ""professional"" light on the current and ongoing risks of investing in Alibaba (BABA) listed on the NYSE as American depositary shares (ADS/ADR). In addition, what happens if the ADR shares eventually did get delisted?  


Here are some thoughts or added questions to consider:  


\-It seems many people have begun the process of converting their US ADR shares to Hong Kong shares. For those left holding US ADR shares, are there any downfalls to this, or could it continue putting downward pressure on the US ADR shares? For non-Chinese investors, it seems like there are risks either way to holding US ADR or Hong Kong shares.

\-If the SEC / NYSE did move ahead with delisting of BABA ADR shares (as well as other companies), would an investor suddenly lose their investment or would the shares simply begin trading over-the-counter? Recent article quote "" If Chinese or other foreign ADRs are delisted, they could move to be traded only on US over-the-counter (OTC) markets rather than the NYSE or Nasdaq exchanges, or potentially barred from trading in the US entirely"".  I'm guessing the share price would likely be hammered regardless, but would the stock in my brokerage account simply switch ticker symbols for example?  


\-On the flip side, there are those who don't think BABA shares will get delisted in the end. A delisting would obviously have negative impacts for both China and US investors, and Alibaba has always seemed to be on the good side of the SEC. Recently, Charlie Munger also invested roughly $37 million into BABA ADR shares through the Daily Journal, and you would think they considered the delisting risk as minimal unless they were okay with potentially losing that much money. 

As full disclosure, I do own BABA ADR shares and would like to remain a long-term holder as I'm comfortable with some of the political risk involved. However, the prospect of losing my investment entirely is not so appealing. With all the delisting talk aside, I do believe Alibaba is undervalued for many reasons and remains a great long term investment.  


So is investing is BABA right now really as risky as going yolo Gamestop (GME), haha. I understand the political arguments, but do most people believe China would actually take such huge steps backwards by halting outside investments and / or the SEC hurting a large number of US investors and ETF funds holding BABA shares?  Definitely seems counterproductive and possibly overblown. Thoughts?",The Risk Outlook of Investing in Alibaba (BABA) ADR,1626697439
stocks,"So I'm sitting 70% cash right now - so if we're not in for a correction then I will be kicking myself. With that said here's some targets I'm looking at for new entries, I have limit buys set on all tickers below:

PINS - &lt;$60: We've retraced to this level in May and seen a bounce, I love the company but I sold at $76 when we started to lose steam, high conviction for $100 on this ticker but it could be years away still, looking to take profit around the $75 region again.

SPCE ~$15: Meme stock I know, and I think people are starting to see how poor the revenue model actually is for this company, with that said I think the buy wall at $15 is massive and cannot be ignored, with the price bleeding towards that value for the second time in 3 months after breaking ATH, both before and after said $15 crash. I think this one may be a dumb money move.

CRSR ~$30: I love this stock already and own many Corsair products. I'd be going all in now if I had the balls but there is a steep cliff edge on this stock, next support may be far away if we can't hold above $29, will be watching this carefully and maybe stopping out below $28 as this is one of the only stocks in my portfolio currently

AMD - &lt;$75: Another favourite of mine, again sold around $81, similar principle to PINS but with the recent chip shortage (bullish long-term imo) and market losing steam I'd look for a cheaper price, it's relatively stable which is why the entry is still pretty high for what it is

NIO - &lt;$34: Not sure if we'll see this price again due to the unpredictability of China/EV Market/Memes but I see it running again if it hits around these levels - I actually avoided this stock in early May when I thought I saw a head and shoulders forming on the 1-month chart and still chastising myself for that one

Ships that have unfortunately sailed for me: NET, NVDA, TSLA, change my mind?

When I go to the “sell” screen it shows an Ask of $0.43 for the Call. If I choose to sell does that mean I still retain $43? And if I “sell” early am I still required to provide the actual shares by expiry?

stocks,"I am not a market expert but I have been observing red flags piling up recently and it’s wise to pay close attention to them as they point to a near market correction including: 

**Low market breadth and divergence:** there are fewer stocks rising versus ones declining, and a larger number of stocks are hitting the 52 week low than the ones hitting the 52 week high. 

**Overbought stocks:** such as AAPL, AMZN, MSFT, NVDA, and ARKK all have recently breached the 70 RSI overbought marker and are now dropping fast. This ties in well with the poor market breadth as allot of the money existing other stocks as they sell off is just pilling in few top stocks in an unstained way, hence the overbought flag. 

**Reduced volumes:** signal weakness in the market and provoke profit taking. For example the Russell 2000 average volume has dropped to just under 3 billion per day from a three months average of 3.7 billion. Incidentally this index tracks 2,000 small cap US companies which have been dropping for most of the last 3 weeks for a total decline of 7.3% thus far. 

**Major trend line broken:** for the second time in less than one month the S&amp;P 500 has dipped under its major trend line. The first time on May 18th, it reversed and went back up on the back of decent labor and production reports plus earnings expectations. Now that earnings are underway and most economic indicators are pointing to growth peaking it might not be able to reverse the drop. 

Obviously all of the above are technical indicators that try to explain market behavior based on historical metrics, but they don’t explain the reasons behind such changes. We have to look at economic news to identify causes including: 

**Peaking economic recovery:** several reports this month point to an economy that has reached peak recovery. For example, both the services PMI 64.6 vs 65.2 vs 64.8 (actual, forecast, previous) and ISM 60.1% vs 63.3% vs 64.0% reports for June show a declining rate of expansion. Also, industrial production is showing similar pattern 0.4% vs 0.6% vs 0.7%.

**Mixed Q2 banking results:** also point to the same issue above. While the overall figures are up, the details point to absence of loan growth and net interest margin weakness. 

**Declining consumer sentiment:** while consumer spending came in higher than expected for the month of June consumer sentiment declined from 85.5 to 80.8. The main driver behind this is inflation.  

**Inflation rising:** the FED has been harping on inflation being transitory because of the “base effect” and some temporary supply constraints. Their timeline for all of that to sort out was few months. Now it’s more than few months and inflation continues to rage registering the highest figures in over a decade with Core CPI (the Fed’s favorite metric) registering 0.9%, the highest increase since 2008.

Furthermore, the PPI (producer price index) also continues to rise at a rate of 1% in June indicating that consumers are still going to see higher prices in the coming months and that overall inflation will overshoot the FED’s 2% threshold by a wide margin. 

**Reemergence of a new variant:**  the delta variant is causing allot of lock downs and interruption throughout the world. While its effect in the US might be limited, a slowing world economy does not bode well for stocks in general, hence perhaps the reason why bonds have gone up. 

**Bond yields going down:** usually indicates that an economy is slowing and investors are looking for safer assists. Many have pointed out that bond yields usually peak 3 months in advance of the stock which they did in March. Since we are in July and bond yield continue to decline many think the bond market is sniffing out something and reacting to it. Remember, the inverse relation between bonds and yields. 

**China’s Crack on tech:** has rattled some investors especially that it came at a time when that market was showing sign of bottoming out. 

All of those events point to a possible correction sometime in the near future. Most experts expect that sometime after Q2 earnings, but it could be starting as we speak, especially that corrections don’t play out in one straight line. They tend to move in a series of several lower lows and lower highs until bottoming out. 

It’s important to also point out that a correction is not a market crash. Corrections are a much smaller event, ranging around a -10% drop on the low end for the leading S&amp;P 500 index and much more for individual speculative stocks. They are a healthy event that helps reinvigorate the market with new buyers. 

A crash on the other hand is a much larger event that’s usually provoked by a combination of events or a single major event. Crashes usually last much longer than people expect, well past the initial large drop. 

There are several catalysts for such an event such as the emergence of a virus variant that outsmarts vaccines or a collapse in the reverse repo facility. The most prominent of them however, is QE tapering (quantitative easing) and increase in interest rates. 

Massive QE and low interest rates have been the driving force behind this bull market. They are the justification given for the current astronomical valuation where the S&amp;P500 Shiller P/E ratio is reaching a whopping 38%! That is a historic high only second to the Dotcom bubble in 2000 (44%) and is in general an unsustainable level in the long term. 

Some argue that the FED will manage to taper QE and increase interest rates gradually in a very controlled manner and avoid any meltdown, but given rising inflation beyond expectations, the FED might very well be forced to act much sooner than it would like.

stocks,"For two decades Chinese tech firms have flocked to the U.S. stock market, drawn by a friendly regulatory environment and a vast pool of capital eager to invest in one of the world’s fastest-growing economies.

Now, the juggernaut behind hundreds of companies worth $2 trillion appears stopped in its tracks.

Beijing’s July 10 announcement that almost all businesses trying to go public in another country will require approval from a newly empowered cybersecurity regulator amounts to a death knell for Chinese initial public offerings in the U.S., according to long-time industry watchers.

“It’s unlikely there will be any U.S.-listed Chinese companies in five to 10 years, other than perhaps a few big ones with secondary listings,” said Paul Gillis, a professor at Peking University’s Guanghua School of Management in Beijing.

The clampdown, triggered by Didi Global Inc.’s decision to push ahead with a New York listing despite objections from regulators, is already sending shockwaves through markets. A gauge of U.S.-traded Chinese stocks has dropped almost 30% from its recent high. For investors in companies that have yet to list, there’s growing uncertainty over when they may get their money back. Wall Street firms are bracing for lucrative underwriting fees to dry up, while Hong Kong is set to benefit as Chinese companies look for alternative -- and politically safer -- venues closer to home.

Chinese shares fare far better in the U.S.
It’s hard to overstate the importance U.S. markets have held for Chinese firms. The first wave began selling American depositary receipts -- surrogate securities that allow investors to hold overseas shares -- in 1999. Since then more than 400 Chinese companies picked U.S. exchanges for their primary listings, raising more than $100 billion, including most of the country’s technology industry. Their stocks later benefited from one of the longest bull markets in history.

Hong Kong-based website operator China.com Corp. began the trend when it went public on the Nasdaq in 1999 during the dotcom bubble. The stock, under the symbol CHINA, surged 236% on its debut, enriching founders and backers, and showing Chinese internet firms a pathway to foreign capital -- if they could only find a way around the Communist Party’s strict regulatory controls.

Unlike companies in Hong Kong, whose laissez-faire approach to business meant there were few rules on company fund-raising, mainland-based private enterprises faced much higher hurdles. Foreign ownership in many industries, especially in the sensitive internet industry, was restricted, while an overseas listing required approval from China’s State Council, or cabinet.

To get around these obstacles, a compromise was found in the shape of a variable interest entity -- a complex corporate structure used by most ADRs including Didi and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. Under a VIE, which was pioneered by now-private Sina Corp. in 2000, Chinese companies are turned into foreign firms with shares that overseas investors can buy. Legally shaky, hard to understand, this solution nonetheless proved acceptable to U.S. investors, Wall Street and the Communist Party alike.

relates to China Signals End to $2 Trillion U.S. Stock Listing Juggernaut
Back in China, the government was taking steps to modernize its stock market, which only reopened in 1990, having been shut forty years earlier following the Communist revolution. In 2009, the country launched the Nasdaq-style ChiNext board in Shenzhen. Under Xi Jinping, who became president in 2013, access to the outside world was greatly increased, including exchange trading links with Hong Kong that allowed foreign investors to buy mainland equities directly. In 2018, China began a trial program to rival ADRs, but it failed to gain traction.

The most radical step came in 2019 when Shanghai opened a new stock venue called Star board, which minimized red tape, allowed unprofitable companies to list onshore for the first time, and got rid of a cap on first-day price moves. It also scrapped an unwritten valuation ceiling which forced companies to sell their shares at 23 times earnings or less. But mainland exchanges still don’t allow for dual-class shares, popular with tech firms because they give founders more voting power. Hong Kong introduced the structure in 2018.

The goal was to create an environment which would enable Chinese tech firms to list successfully at home, and be less reliant on U.S. capital. This need became all the more pressing as tensions between Beijing and Washington increased during the latter part of former President Donald Trump’s presidency. Trump introduced tough new rules that mean Chinese firms may be kicked off exchanges in a few years’ time if they refuse to hand over financial information to U.S. regulators.

Why China and U.S. Are Clashing Over Stock Listings: QuickTake

While secondary listings in Hong Kong picked up, Chinese firms still preferred New York, where it takes weeks rather than months to process an IPO application. China’s strict capital controls meant domestic exchanges couldn’t compete with New York on liquidity and far higher valuations for tech companies. China Inc. raised $13 billion through first time share sales in the U.S. this year alone.

After Didi’s contentious June 30 IPO, it appears the Communist Party decided it had had enough.

“The death of ADRs was inevitable,” said Fraser Howie, author of ‘Red Capitalism: The Fragile Financial Foundation of China’s Extraordinary Rise.’ “What’s interesting is the mold and template that’s achieving that result. It’s coming from a mindset of control and clamping down on business. That’s very different to a mindset of reform and building markets domestically.”

Beijing’s move to regulate overseas IPOs coincides with stricter controls over China’s technology firms, many of which have near-monopolies in their fields and vast pools of user data. This campaign to rein in the tech industry has accelerated in recent months as Xi seeks to limit the influence of the billionaires who control these firms.

For Chinese companies already listed in the U.S., what happens next largely depends on what China does with VIEs. Banning them outright would be unlikely, as it would force firms to delist from foreign exchanges, unwind that structure and then relist -- a costly process that would take years. The updated regulations are expected to be ready in a month or two, people familiar with the matter have said.

Hong Kong is increasingly looking like a viable alternative. For one, China plans to exempt Hong Kong IPOs from first seeking the approval of the country’s cybersecurity regulator, Bloomberg reported last week. In a forced U.S. delisting, firms that already sold shares in Hong Kong -- like Alibaba and JD.com -- can migrate their primary listing to the city. The delisted U.S. receipts, which can still trade off-exchange, won’t be worthless because they represent an economic interest in the company. Hong Kong’s open markets and greenback-pegged currency should facilitate the conversion.

Holders can sell their ADRs before they are delisted or convert them into the Hong Kong-listed common stock without much disruption. A company choosing to terminate its ADR program entirely can also pay out a dollar amount to investors.

Either way, it seems that the two-decade era that saw China’s most successful and powerful private firms list in the U.S. is coming to a close. The message from Beijing is clear: the Communist Party will have the final say on pretty much everything, including IPOs.

“It’s really important to own companies that are aligned with the direction of the Chinese government,” said Tom Masi, co-portfolio manager of GW&amp;K Investment Management’s emerging wealth strategy fund, which has half its money invested in Chinese stocks. “I would not be financing companies that are going to circumvent anything that the Chinese government wants to accomplish.”

stocks,"**Intro:** Owlet (OWLT), a company who helps parents keep their babies safe and greatly reduce the risk of SIDS (the leading cause of death among infants), has likely become the most shorted stock in the world. WTF? Yes, but how is this possible and why are short interest websites not showing this yet? Read on to find out:

**Background:** OWLT just officially IPO'ed last Friday after going public through a SP@C (formerly SBG) and so all the financial websites have not updated its short interest and/or total float yet. One of the unique things about a SP@C is that right before the official IPO or ""merger,"" a shareholder can trade in their shares for their net asset value of $10 instead of actually holding shares in the company. What’s been happening recently though is that large hedge funds buy up all the shares they can get at \~$9.98 right before merger and then trade them in for their $10 cash trust value for a guaranteed 0.2% profit. For every share that is traded in, the company will receive $10 lesson funding and there will also be one less share in the total float after the official IPO.

**The Short Position Is Taken:** With SP@Cs getting smacked across the board recently, a profitable strategy has been to short shares prior to the official IPO since that is when the $10 floor is removed for a SP@C. Therefore, Hedge Fund ABC sees an opportunity in shorting OWLT in anticipation of it dropping in price after merger. So, they short as many shares (1.77 million) as they can.  More specifically, a large chunk of those shares were shorted at the end of June when the stock was at $10, which for the most part would only be done by a principle short planning to hold their short into deSP@C (merger). At the time, OWLT had 23 million shares total, so it wasn’t THAT high of a short interest ratio.

**The Total Available Shares Reduces by 86%:** As mentioned in the background, there have been an increasing amount of SP@C shares bought by hedge funds and traded in to secure a 0.2% profit. So, Hedge Fund XYZ decides to do this with OWLT, which was trading at $9.97-9.98 for about a month before the official IPO date. Ultimately, they buy up an incredible 86% of the float trade them in for $10 before merger. Sure, Owlet now has 86% less of the cash in the SP@C trust  to make their life-saving baby products but oh well, hedge funds gotta get paid their 0.2% ya know? As a result, this removes 86% of the shares available from the total float, which means that the original 23 million float is reduced to only 3.24 million shares.

**Putting It Together:** With these two moves, OWLT now has a float of only 3.24 million shares with 1.77 million of those shares sold short based on the most recent data from the end of June. (Could there more or less shares shorted since that time? Yes, but I'm guessing if anything short interest got even higher since almost every SP@C these past two weeks has been dropping like a fly after their official IPO debut, further confirming the hedge fund's short strategy.)

With 1.77 million shares sold short, this would equate to a short interest ratio of 54.6%, which according to [highshortinterest.com](http://highshortinterest.com/) would make it by far the most shorted stock in the world with second place coming in at 39.14%. They don't have OWLT at the top of the list right now because financial websites have not updated the total available float as the company technically just went public on Friday (July 16).

Given the information, I wouldn't want to be short the stock in a situation like this. I'm betting that the people who are, are unaware of the situation and might get caught very off side. Being caught off side, in size, is a very tough spot to be in especially considering the low volume/float. It'll be interesting to see what happens in the coming days.

**TL;DR:**

* Hedge Fund ABC shorts OWLT as much as they can (1.77 million shares) before the official IPO date and $10 floor is removed.
* Hedge Fund XYZ buys up as many of the shares as they can (86% of the float) and trades them in to make 0.2% profit, subsequently reducing the total available float by 86%.
* As a result, based on the latest data, OWLT now has a total float of only 3.24 million shares with 54.6% of those shares shorted. With this small of a float and high of short interest, Hedge Fund ABC's short position would be incredibly vulnerable if people start to catch on.

**Data backing this thesis:**

As a result, there will be approximately $32.4 million remaining in the trust account following redemptions.""* (Note: originally, there were 23 million shares available for a total trust value of $230 million).

If you've read this far, I might as well also share a bit about the company itself. From what I can tell, Owlet actually a pretty good company. Here's their [investor presentation](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1004/3036/files/Owlet_SPAC_Presentation_Deck_Feb-2021_Final.pdf?v=1613532833).

From slide 24, you can see their smart sock and baby monitoring product has an NPS score of 76 and 68, which is very high, on par or higher than any Apple product. From slide 24, you can see that they are developing a whole platform of products beyond their smart sock and cam to help parents take care of their babies. On Glassdoor, they have a 4.6 rating and 100% CEO approval. Amazon product reviews are all 4.5+ stars with a Fakespot score of B. Nice.

On slide 7, it shows their valuation was $1.39B at a price of $10. At its current price of $9.10 and reduced cash position as a result of the shares traded in, the valuation is now $1.1B. Considering that they are growing at \~50%, have expected 2022 revenues of $175M, gross margins of \~50%, it honestly doesn’t seem like a bad valuation to me.  Mainly though, I'm in this play for the squeeze.","Why Owlet (OWLT), the baby cam/sock company, has likely become the most shorted stock in the world at 54.6% SI without people even realizing",1626661886

stocks,"(Bloomberg) -- Zoom Video Communications Inc. has agreed to acquire Five9 Inc. for $14.7 billion in stock, targeting a cloud service provider that could shore up its popular virtual meeting app.

Five9 stockholders will receive 0.5533 shares of Zoom’s Class A common stock under an agreement announced Sunday. The target firm will become an operating unit of Zoom’s after the deal, which is subject to shareholder approval and slated to close in the first half of 2022.

Zoom rose to prominence after the pandemic hit in early 2020, becoming ubiquitous as people forced home by lockdowns used the service to connect remotely to work, school, friends and family. But investors have raised concerns this year about whether that growth will continue as vaccinations increase and shutdowns end. Zoom’s stock soared about five-fold during 2020 and its market cap has pushed past $100 billion.

stocks,"in my experience, Ive come to the conclusion that market sentiment matters more than any fundamental aspect of any company.

You can have a company making zero revenue be worth billions of dollars, and as long as no one sells their shares, the company will maintain this value.

On the other side, if a company has zero traction, no matter how well they do, if there are zero buyers, it will stay stagnant.

As for ratio multipliers, these only remain relevant so long as there are buyers and sellers. For example,
if there is zero demand for shares but increasing assets, then the book value will decrease.

With stocks often trading at multiples higher than revenue, some as high as 30-50x, how can you reasonably justify valuations higher than this?

My belief is

- fundamentals and technicals of companies drive buyers to buy shares, leading to increased price.

-in the absence of buyers, the share price will stay the same.

stocks," 

Hello investors,

It's been about a month since I last posted and there are a few updates that I wanted to share before I get down to today's memo.

1. I finally created an official mod account with user ID midasinvestors. This will be the official mod account going forward.
2. I will be posting weekly memos again. I was settling into a new city and lots were happening in the past few weeks. Apologies for the lack of activity in the recent weeks.
3. Due to new compliance requirements by my new employer, I will be restrained in sharing/speaking to some of the topics. I appreciate everyone understanding that in advance.

With that said, let's get straight down to today's topic.

As a background, I have worked in investment banking and equity/credit research. When I was getting started, the best way I learned was by reading books like Peter Lynch's investing series, Warren Buffett, Bill Ackman, etc.

However, I've been increasingly noticing that a lot of people are leaving out some very important components to a stock analysis or taking big leaps in assumptions.

For instance, many people nowadays seem to be making premature conclusions along the lines of

""the US government is pushing for clean energy initiatives and therefore, Tesla stock will be going up"" or

""the real estate market in the US is very hot right now and it's a great time to buy a home"" or

""Amazon will report amazing quarterly earnings so the stock is a buy"".

And by the way, it's very natural and understandable why they make these kinds of arguments. In fact, it's human nature to think in this way.

The reason is that we have a cognitive bias called **""hindsight bias"".**

It basically means that people tend to believe they knew the results before they happened.

For example, when the Bucs won the Super Bowl last year, some claimed they knew it was inevitable.

Or some claim that they knew that the stock market would recover in less than a year.

Because of this strong belief that we already ""knew"" the results before they happened, we can also predict results going forward, which leads to a **confirmation bias** but I won't get into details in this memo.

**My point is that we need to be aware of all the cognitive biases affecting our decision-making because we all have them.** Some are more easily influenced by them than others.

The reason why I bring up these biases is that a stock analysis needs to contain a bias-free forecast.

I'll provide a sample pitch that I made a while back for illustration purposes (**for those who'd like a copy of this sample pitch, please add your email to the memo distribution list in Midasinvestors page and you'll receive a copy).**

\[chart deleted because the forum doesn't allow it\]

Now, I understand that some of you may be just getting started and I'm not saying you need to know the ins and outs of this one-pager.

I want to emphasize the three components to the analysis:

1. Investment Thesis
2. Valuation
3. Risks
4. Investment Thesis

Most people are aware of the first part. We know to invest in ""companies that produce things we are familiar with"" like Apple, Disney, Spotify, etc. But that's not enough of an investment thesis.

It's because what if a competitor comes out with a better product at a better price point? What if the industry dies in a matter of years (which can happen as evidenced by Blackberry, Xerox, iPods, etc.)? What if the management executes a terrible merger?

My point is that a thesis should explain why there is a **strong competitive advantage that's durable in the company.**

What's to keep Thor Industries the largest manufacturer of recreational vehicles? Because it has the largest and most efficient manufacturing plants and largest dealership network in the world. There is a high barrier-to-entry for any new entrants to compete. Management has been known to be great capital allocators, meaning they know when to issue debt to build a new manufacturing plant, acquire a business, or buy back its own stock.

These points back up the claim that Thor has a durable competitive advantage and will keep the business growing.

2) Valuation

**Second part to a stock analysis is arguably the most important component: the valuation.**

All great investors argue your entry point is one of your biggest factors in making an investment decision.

Yes, the company's growth can explain the heightened valuation but when I hear that argument, I always point to this graph below.

\[chart deleted because the forum doesn't allow it\]

It took Microsoft 15 years to recover from its peak at the dot com bubble.

Now I know some of you will immediately argue back that this is not a dot com bubble but that's not the point I wanted to make.

I'm trying to say that leaving out a valuation analysis is like buying a house without knowing what the price is.

**""Amazon is a buy because it's got 1), 2), 3), etc."" without talking about its valuation is like saying ""this house is a buy because it's in a great location, newly remodeled, etc."" without saying how much it is selling for.**

Valuation can be represented in multiple ways. Here are some basic ratios to look at.

Growth companies: because they earn negative income, you should pay more attention to the growth story.

P/S, EV/S (enterprise value to sales), P/Gross profit, PEG (PE to growth ratio)

Mature companies: because they have peaked in their growth cycle, they have consistent cash flows

EV/EBITDA, P/E, EV/FCF (free cash flow)

Next step is to assess whether these ratios are reasonable.

Going back to the real estate example, if you knew the house you were looking at is priced at $1.5 million, that doesn't really tell you anything.

You need to look at how much rent you can charge the house for, what nearby houses are selling at, and recent transactions in the neighborhood.

Similarly, you need to look at the P/S ratios and gross profit margins of competitors in the same industry to see if your computed numbers line up well.

If Thor is trading at 15x PE ratio, it may sound cheap but when you realize that its competitors are trading at 8x PE ratio, you know that it's overvalued compared to its peers.

You need to figure out why your company is overvalued/undervalued compared to its peers and whether it's justified. If it is undervalued for no good reason, such as there is a CFO scandal, then it could be a good opportunity.

3) Risks

This is also one of the most overlooked component to a stock analysis.

In any investment, there are risks. The simple reason is that nothing is ""guaranteed"" in the world.

Are you guaranteed to be healthy tomorrow? No, but the chances are, you are much more likely to be healthy than sick.

Is Amazon guaranteed to go up in the next 5 years? No, but chances are high.

**Your role as an analyst is to increase your odds in your bet.**

The more analysis you do, the more you eliminate the risks of making a bad investment.

To summarize today's memo, I strongly encourage you to approach a stock analysis from a multi-dimensional level.

Don't buy a house just because it's newly built, or it's in a great location, or your rental incomes are high.

Buy it because the price doesn't reflect the upcoming developments in the neighborhood that'll result in home price appreciation, or because your house is undervalued compared to recent houses that sold in the nearby area, or because the house has an opportunity for price appreciation through minor renovations.

stocks,"I have this cool freeware free compound interest calculator.  Not sure where I got it.  Anyways I was fooling aroumd with some minimums today to see how much can be earned from just a little saving.

Anyways I plugged in a modest 8% interest rate and a $200 month deposit and set it for 5 years.  

I started from scratch with 0 initial deposit and see that after 5 years my deposits of $12k were more than the $2080 interest I earned with 8% interest rate.

I noticed that with the same contribution rate ($200 month) and a initial $20k deposit the deposit and interest earned after 5 years were almost equal.

After an initial $20k deposit and the same 5 years, 8% return rate your interest earned started to outweigh your deposits after 5 years.

For example, if I start with $30k and contribute $200 a month at 8% interest rate after 5 years my deposits were $12k and interest earned was $16k.

LON:SLP - Sylvania Platinum

Actually derives most of its revenue from Rhodium these days. 
This company is trading on a tiny p/e - it’s just too cheap I think. 
£280m market cap. 
Net cash over $100m at end March
Last quarter net profit of $40m. 

Operations are all based in South Africa. The company produces platinum group metals by processing the tailings of other producers. It’s lower risk than mining, but means they are reliant on their host-mines for tailings inputs. 
Huge margins, dividend paying. Final quarter update should be this month, with annual report in September. 
They will hopefully give an indication of what they will do with all that cash!

The company that owns the Warhammer series of worlds. 

I used to play the table top war game as a kid, and the game is stronger than ever. 
Revenue has tripled since 2015. 

I love this company because of the richness of the IP. The worlds are enormous and they keep building up the story.  That’s an incredible asset, and the company is getting better and better at monetising it.

So the first thing you would like to do is to identify this early morning. US securities are traded as early as 4AM east coast time. These trades come worldwide and in the US come VIA WEBULL. I trade mainly with a TD, ETRADE and FIDELITY and these start at 7am. Same as Schwab. So once you are up you can look at the most heavily traded stocks. These will all be MEMEs..... why? because if the volume is 20-30% normal daily volume by 7-8am you better believe it has been hyped! The Memes at times have traded near 50x normal! Check ORPH and even CLOV when CLOV hit 30!

The next step is to try and get yourself familiar with LEVEL 2 along with a minute chart nearby. Unfortunately, for myself I use 2 cell phones as I am working. I did have a very good look at TD Think or SWIM desktop and was able to see magic with CRSR! Once you have level 2's it will be easier to identify the auctions, buyers and sellers. What I didnt say in the video is if you plan on doing this alot it is ok to setup a stop loss...I have never actually done that. If you make 5 of these trades and 1 is a loss you will still come out ahead.

I got stuck.....now what? You're in luck if it was a meme then Reddit Army. Your best bet is circling the wagon and being a cheerleader. Contact the Mods, the Posters and see if they will allow more posts to get fuel for the army.. If you garner enough interest maybe the army can save you!

These 3 company's make money and have growth. You do not have to look out 1-2 years. Pray for the army to save you.

stocks," **Overview**

What is exactly is Global-E? They are a company that integrates with e-commerce platforms to remove complexity with international transactions and provide localized solutions that improve the online shopping experience. The core of the services revolve around the following (from the S-1):

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;“The vast capabilities of our end-to-end platform include interaction with shoppers in their native languages, market-adjusted pricing, payment options tailored to local market preferences, compliance with local consumer regulations and requirements such as customs duties and taxes, shipping services, after-sales support and returns management. These elements are unified under the Global-e platform to enhance the shopper experience and enable merchants to capture the cross-border opportunity.”

&amp;#x200B;

They are the “plug and play” of making e-commerce international. Their vast network of APIs allow a customer to simply integrate their platform and seamlessly begin selling across different borders and languages. Here’s what they do.

&amp;#x200B;

Currently, Global-E supports:

* Local messaging in over 25 languages
* Purchases in over 100 currencies
* Accepts over 150 payment methods
* A multitude of competitively-priced shipping options

&amp;#x200B;

**Business Model**

Global-E generates revenues by charging a fee (“service fee”) for the integration of their platform into a merchant’s services. Service fees are highly variable based on transaction volume, destination markets, level of customer service provided, etc, and are generated as a percentage of the Gross Merchandise Value (“GMV”) that flows through the platform. Global-E mandatorily bundles certain components of their integrated platform solutions that they believe are essential for achieving improved sales conversions from international traffic. However, their fulfillment services are offered on an optional basis and merchants can choose to utilize those services or cancel at any time. Think of it as bundling service A and B to have the greatest effect, while offering service C as an add-on component. Service fees make up for approximately 35% of revenue while fulfillment services are currently accounting for roughly 65%.

&amp;#x200B;

**Partnerships &amp; why they use Global-E**

Global-E has formed many key technological as well as service partnerships. These third-party e-commerce platforms include: Salesforce Commerce Cloud, Shopify, BigCommerce, Magento Commerce, SAP, WooCommerce, PrestaShop, and others.

&amp;#x200B;

*What they do for merchants?*

Some of the key benefits they provide for merchants are:

* increased sales conversions: converting international traffic
* offloading complexities: handling local pricing, payment collection, import duties, fraud, etc 
* reduction of risk: reduce legal complexity, manage import duties and taxes, handle compliance
* enabling growth to new markets: allowing merchants flexibility to expand to cross-border opportunities

All while emphasizing merchant branding. The customer always faces the digital store-front and never leaves the brand page to check-out.

&amp;#x200B;

*What they do for shoppers?*

Global-E’s goal is to offer a frictionless shopping journey, regardless of the origin of the customer. This means:

* Localized languages
* Re-pricing in local currencies
* Handling cross-border payments
* Accurately pre-price import duties and taxes and include them in the final cost of the product
* Delivery: using an extensive network of over 20 shipping carriers they are able to offer multiple shipping modes at attractive rates.
* After-sale support and returns

Merchants integrating Global-E into their platform generally experience a significantly higher international traffic conversion rate (often exceeding 60%). The Global-E platform removes many complexities involved with international expansion. They already have more than 400 merchants, from small companies to globally-recognized retailers, on the platform across various diversified verticals.

&amp;#x200B;

**Shopify Deal**

As mentioned above, one of Global-E most lucrative partners lies with Shopify making them the exclusive third-party and cross-border solution across the large network of Shopify merchants. Shopify knows what kind of business that will bring for Global-E and thus Shopify has bought 7.75 million shares and acquired a **6.5% stake** in the company. As Shopify grows Global-E grows and Shopify knows this, hence the stake in a company that reflects their own revenues by proxy.

&amp;#x200B;

**TAM, &amp; CAGR**

First came the transition to domestic e-commerce as well as sourcing and reselling products from China (aka Dropshipping). Next is going to be the transition of global e-commerce and cross-border sales. According to this 225 page **research by GlobeNewsWire**, the global cross-border B2C e-commerce market was 780 billion in 2019 and expected to grow at a CAGR of 27% through 2026 where it will become a 4.82 trillion market.

&amp;#x200B;

**Global-E’s Smart Insights**

One of the company’s strengths lies within sophisticated “Smart Insights” they use to scale their applications. Smart Insights is a “big data” network that uses various metrics such as country, price-point, and shopper behaviors allowing Global-E to provide highly-optimized experience for shoppers. This ends up driving increased conversion rates and revenues for the merchant and a better overall experience for the shopper. The company has noted by integrating big-data into their platform they can experience “economies of scale” as well as “economies of skill” enabling them to optimize merchants’ cross-border sales. These insights are continuously expanding as they collect additional data points along the purchasing journey.

&amp;#x200B;

**Competitive Advantage &amp; Growth Opportunities**

What seems to be becoming more of a trend since 2020 and even more so now in 2021 are corporation’s use of big data. I’m not talking about basic user data such as age, gender, location, but more on the lines of vastly large information networks. These networks can utilize things such as time spent on page, scrolls, and clicks all in one massive database. Global-E differentiates themselves through their main data asset (“Smart Insights”) that informs them on certain decisions and is able to optimize how merchants sell their product across different borders. They integrate this data network into a flywheel effect, for example: their current analytics drives more sales to merchants, which then feeds new data back into the system, which then allows for higher optimization and better conversions. They feed into each other back and forth getting smarter with each website visitor and purchase. This aligns perfectly for their products “Net Dollar Retention Rate” of 134% and 172% in 2019 and 2020, respectively.

&amp;#x200B;

Global-E attributes much of their growth to being a first mover (and doing it right) in the cross-border e-commerce space. Their success has been accelerated by several key factors, such as:

* Accelerated shift towards e-commerce outpacing traditional retail
* Cross-border e-commerce growing faster than domestic e-commerce
* Their merchant’s strategic focus on D2C sales, maintaining relationship with shoppers globally
* The complexity and limitations of leaving the merchant responsible for implementing what Global-E offers. This doesn’t come down to just a cost, but also time-intensive as well as being difficult to maintain and scale
* Covid-19 tailwinds

&amp;#x200B;

As a result of the above and other market factors, the cross-borders e-commerce market is expected to continue the surge in growth. I previously mentioned the forecast in TAM however, Forrester, a research company, also expects the cross-border e-commerce markets to reach $736 billion by 2023.

Global-E has several opportunities to expand on existing channels and capture new markets. This can be done with:

* Growth through existing portfolio of merchants and strengthening relationships
* Acquiring new merchants in existing geographies
* Expanding in new geographies that they don’t have exposure to
* Continue to expand and innovate their platform
* Continue to develop strategic partnerships (with key brands and players)

&amp;#x200B;

**Risks**

Many of Global-E’s risks fall under the category of general business risks. Some of these include: retaining old merchants and attracting new ones, failing to enhance the platform as well as successfully competing against new and existing competition, failing to manage growth, pricing pressures from competition, and being highly dependent on cross-border regulations, sales, and operations.

&amp;#x200B;

**Revenues, Scale, &amp; Profitability**

In FY 2020 Global-E helped process 4.6 million orders for their merchants generating $136.4 million. Their Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) also grew to 774 million for the same period. Other impressive metrics were their net dollar retention rate and gross profit as % of revenue both of which continue to climb at 172% and 31.9%, respectively. Stellar!

&amp;#x200B;

Although the company has recently turned a profit while growing top-line revenue and GMV at a high pace. The company suggested that short-term profitability might be sacrificed due to the expansions they are making to cover larger markets. As noted from the S-1:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;“We expect our operating expenses to significantly increase over the next several years as we hire additional personnel, expand into new geographies, expand our partnerships, operations, and infrastructure, continue to enhance our platform, develop and expand its features, integrations and capabilities, expand and improve our service offering and increase our spending on sales and marketing. We intend to continue to build and enhance our platform through internal research and development and we may also selectively pursue acquisitions.”

&amp;#x200B;

Let’s take a quick peak at their consolidated statement of operations. Note the revenue growth and total operating expenses that *decreas*e, as a percentage of total revenue, as revenues increase (almost doubles YoY).

&amp;#x200B;

**Valuation**

Looking at GLBE’s valuation it is clear that you pay a premium when owning this company.

&amp;#x200B;

*The Good*

GLBE is growing revenue at 134% YoY.

Gross margins are improving while the company continues to scale.

Many tech and services partnerships they can piggy back on.

&amp;#x200B;

*The Bad*

Consistent profitability could be years away as the company is investing heavily into their own expansion of current and new markets.

GLBE is currently trading at roughly 50x price to sales and 260 forward P/E.

&amp;#x200B;

*Up for Debate*

Global-E has almost no long-term debt, but current liabilities are stacking up while the company is not generating much FCF. I wouldn’t expect them to be generating this much FCF this early in the game after their IPO.

Lock-up expiration on August 11, 2021.

&amp;#x200B;

**Final Thoughts**

In my opinion Global-E is top of the class when it comes to their business. They are growing extremely fast while improving margins and this is the premium you would pay versus investing in a “stable” company generating tons of FCF, but not much growth. Due to the nature of being a high-growth stock there will naturally be more volatility around the trade. While it’s currently trading at 50x price/sales I am more likely to shy away from entering a new position. We could see this stock swing to 40x p/s and potentially enter on the dips.

This is somewhat of a chicken or the egg situation because there might not be any dips to buy with this kind of growth. For example, at current growth rates (100-135% YoY) if stock price is maintained it would only be trading at less than half it’s price/sales valuation only one year from now. This is definitely a stock to monitor closely if you are wanting to find the right entry point for a long-term hold.

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR;**

1. Global-E is an “enabler” that allows e-commerce and digital stores to seamlessly integrate international transactions. They deal with tasks from translations, currency re-pricing, international shipping &amp; returns, compliance &amp; tax regulations, etc.
2. GLBE integrates their proprietary “Smart Insights” application that analyses customer shopping and transaction data to continuously improve on sales conversions. The feedback loop is always learning as it collects more and more data along each customer’s purchase journey.
3. GLBE is trading at a rich valuation given their total revenue was $136 million in 2020. However, they are growing top-line revenues and Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) over 130% Y.o.Y. Shopify holds a 6.5% stake in Global-E as GLBE facilitates a large amount of transactions on the Shopify network. As Shopify grows, GLBE grows.
4. GLBE is growing through many tailwinds such as those from covid lockdowns and accelerated shift toward e-commerce outpacing traditional retail. They’ve got an opportunity to expand into more international regions, strengthen relationships with existing merchants, while continuing to expand and improve their platform.",The Weekly DD - Global-E Online (GLBE): The Uncut Diamond,1626620915
stocks,"As the title says this post is just going over some basic rules of thumb. If anything it can be positive reinforcement to the seasoned trader 

So naturally, when we see a stock thats $1 or even pennies we just feel like it isnt much to invest. We feel like we have more leverage and can buy more. What we should be concerned about though is % gain as well as risk. You buy a $1 stock and the risk is 90% and invested $100. What you actually did was roll the dice and gambled. How about buying a stock thats $10 that will go up 10%. We all make those mistakes at some point.

OTC or AMEX arent as regulated as the Nasdaq or NYSE so personally the only OTC stock that I have traded the last several months is FNMA. It has been a few months but I do not feel like I am taking a huge risk trading it.

Personally, I do not buy penny stocks at the moment. I have in the past and if you're willing to take the risk/bet you can be rewarded. I do not take to many risks personally, if any. Many times these penny stocks are a pump and dump and in the old days were sent via emails to the masses. It is much easier now with social media and Reddit!

A company under $200 million you just have to investigate. There are alot of good companies under $200. Just make sure you really check out the financials and sales. It is very easy for a company under this market cap to be manipulated. They may trade under $1 million a day and you can have a small group making it seem that the stock is hot!

Lastly, we can not assume that a stock under $5 is a deal. There are good company's under $5 but like above we must do some research. Does the company have cash, sales, debt? Are they making money? Generally company's do not like to be under $10. It is offensive and many times people on the street assume a stock price reflects a company's health so they do not like the thought of being a bad company.

Good luck everyone.","Just a rule of thumb when buying a stock on the OTC, AMEX or other Exchanges. Also, be careful of Penny stocks, Must do Due diligence",1626620869

stocks,"I know I’ve spoken to people on here in the same situation as me. You started investing at the beginning of 2021 and you’ve been trading sideways since you started. Your portfolio has been jumping between positive and negative all-time. I’m not worried and you shouldn’t be either. 

I would assume that most people finding themselves in this scenario aren’t index fund or “safe” investors. You’re trying to build a high growth portfolio for the long term like I am. 

For reference, here is my portfolio breakdown:

“Safer” steady growers - HON, WMT, ABBV, GE, SONY, CLF, NEE*, and BHVN*. I see NEE and BHVN as safer compared to the other high growth stocks I own. BHVN has a very promising pipeline of drugs and has grown a lot as of late. NEE may be the most promising renewable energy company in the market. 

Mega-cap tech - AAPL and GOOGL.

More speculative, high-growth - BABA, AMD, ZG, NIO, NOK, PSFE, PLTR, SOFI, DKNG, MTZ, ETSY, and STEM.

That’s my portfolio. 22 positions as of now. Out of those, here are the ones I’m currently negative in - BABA, ZG, PSFE, PLTR, SOFI, DKNG, MTZ, and GE. Besides GE, the rest of those are more speculative and more or what I would consider high growth. That’s what has been getting hit as of late. I’m not worried because I am confident these companies will do well long term and the stock prices will inevitably go up. In the short term, I’ll continue to average down through DCA. I’ll grit my teeth through the risks of inflation and rising interest rates. Short term it may be rough, but long term I think it will pay off. I will not sell any of these companies. I may add a few “safer” companies or buy up some VTI, but I think this aggressive approach will be well worth it.","If you started investing this year, don’t fret.",1626619065

So is the only motivation for buying a stock is that you can sell it for more later to someone else?

Im a bit confused on how these rates come about. As I understand it, the interest rates are determined by market forces and the inverse relationship between yields and price. If more people buy a bond, price goes up, and yield goes down because the coupon payments are fixed. But if yields are low, people would want to sell bonds because they can get better returns elsewhere. 

Basically I’m confused as to what leads what. It seems to me that decisions about what to buy or sell are dependent upon interest rates and yields.

stocks,"&gt;The first three rounds of stimulus checks helped families cover household expenses and other needs during the pandemic. But a fourth payment isn't included in the [draft bipartisan infrastructure](https://www.cnet.com/personal-finance/bipartisan-infrastructure-deal-what-does-it-really-promise/) plan or any of President Joe Biden's recent proposals. The one definite form of aid going to millions of families in 2021 is the expanded [child tax credit](https://www.cnet.com/personal-finance/taxes/child-tax-credit-irs-is-sending-15-billion-in-payments-this-week-heres-what-to-know/) program, which started this week. This year, even parents who don't make enough to pay income taxes can qualify for the monthly payments of up to $300 per child.   
&gt;  
&gt;Though some lawmakers had called for more stimulus money in the spring, many now argue it's less of a priority due to signs of a post-lockdown economic rebound -- like [new jobless claims](https://www.dol.gov/ui/data.pdf) dropping to the lowest since last year. But the call for ongoing relief aid is gaining public support. With over 2.6 million signatures, a [Change.org petition](https://www.change.org/p/give-2000-month-to-every-american-moneyforthepeople-covid19) states: ""The true unemployment rate for low-wage workers is estimated at over 20% and many people face large debts from last year for things like utilities, rent and child care.""  
&gt;  
&gt;So what does this mean about the fate of a fourth stimulus check? We'll explain below. As for other money matters, new rules for the child tax credit give parents the [option of receiving the advance monthly checks](https://www.cnet.com/personal-finance/taxes/opting-out-of-child-tax-credit-checks-3-reasons-why-you-might-want-to-before-aug-2/) for extra cash this year or receiving one lump sum for up to $3,600 per kid in 2022.

stocks,"CureVac N.V. is a German biopharmaceutical company that develops therapies based on messenger RNA. Legally domiciled in the Netherlands and headquartered in Tübingen, Germany, the company was founded in 2000 by Ingmar Hoerr, Steve Pascolo, Florian von der Mulbe, Günther Jung, and Hans-Georg Rammensee.

CureVac reached $120.43 in February per share and was battered upon news their COVID vaccine was 48% effective against all COVID variants (77% efficacy in preventing moderate to serious illness and 100% efficacy in preventing hospitalization or death -- among participants ages 18 to 60.)

However, what most fail to realize is the COVID vaccine is a small part of their product pipeline/portfolio. 

The German government has invested more than 300 million euros into CureVac. 

CureVac has both appointed a new COO and that one of the company’s cofounders has resigned from the board to focus full-time on improving the manufacturing process for its RNA vaccines.

CureVac has received funding from the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation.

The company's focus is on developing vaccines for infectious diseases and drugs to treat cancer and rare diseases. CureVac has entered into various collaborations with organizations, including agreements with [Boehringer Ingelheim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boehringer_Ingelheim), [Sanofi Pasteur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanofi_Pasteur), [Johnson &amp; Johnson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnson_%26_Johnson), [Genmab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genmab), the [Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_%26_Melinda_Gates_Foundation), [Eli Lilly and Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eli_Lilly_and_Company), [GlaxoSmithKline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GlaxoSmithKline), [Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_for_Epidemic_Preparedness_Innovations), the [International AIDS Vaccine Initiative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_AIDS_Vaccine_Initiative), and the [government of Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_of_Germany)

In October 2013 CureVac launched a collaboration with [Janssen Pharmaceuticals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janssen_Pharmaceuticals) Inc., a [Johnson &amp; Johnson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnson_%26_Johnson) company, for the development of novel flu vaccines. Also in 2013, CureVac announced the fourth in a series of partnerships with the [Cancer Research Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_Research_Institute) and [Ludwig Cancer Research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_Cancer_Research) to enable clinical testing of novel cancer immunotherapy treatment options.

In March 2014, CureVac won a €2 million prize awarded by the European Commission to stimulate new vaccine technologies. Later, in July 2014, CureVac signed an exclusive license agreement with [Sanofi Pasteur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanofi_Pasteur) to develop and commercialize an mRNA-based prophylactic vaccine. By September 2014, the company licensed the global rights for its Phase I candidate – CV9202 – to [Boehringer Ingelheim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boehringer_Ingelheim). Boehringer was to conduct trials using the [mRNA vaccine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MRNA_vaccine) in combination with [afatinib](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afatinib) in advanced and/or metastatic [epidermal growth factor receptor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermal_growth_factor_receptor) (EGFR) mutated [non-small cell lung cancer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-small_cell_lung_cancer) (NSCLC) as well as inoperable stage III NSCLC.

In March 2015, a CureVac investor, the [Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_%26_Melinda_Gates_Foundation), agreed to provide separate funding for several projects to develop prophylactic vaccines based on CureVac's proprietary mRNA platform. By September 2015, CureVac entered into a collaboration with the [International AIDS Vaccine Initiative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_AIDS_Vaccine_Initiative) (IAVI) to accelerate the development of AIDS vaccines, utilizing immunogens developed by IAVI and partners, delivered via CureVac's mRNA technology. That same month, CureVac announced it would open a United States hub in [Boston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston), [Massachusetts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts).

In accordance with its deal with Lilly, the company began construction on a production facility in 2016.

I know the COVID vaccine was a huge letdown ... but the hit the stock took was way too extreme for a 21-year-old company that now has the sturdy research bones necessary to continue building healing vaccines well into the future. Their RNA printer is now ready to start new trials and they have so much more in the pipeline (rabies vaccines, lassa/yellow fever vaccines, Respirational syncytial virus vaccine,  Other infectious diseases vaccines, Rota, malaria, universal influenza vaccines, Cutaneous melanoma cures, adenoidcystic carcinoma cures, squamous cell cancer of skin, head and neck cures, Non-small cell lung cancer cures, Tumor associated antigens (TAA) cures, Shared neo-antigens, Cas9 gene-editing, Ocular diseases, Lung respiratory diseases, Therapeutic antibodies).

This is a $10+ billion company that has a fantastic future ahead of it for long-term investors. Short term, they suffered a blow, but the ding their stock took was way too large.

IMO, shilling stocks and manipulating the market, like many people argue is happening, isn't nearly as lucrative as you'd think. I'm not saying it hasn't happened, or couldn't happen, but that's not where their bread is buttered. As we all know, nobody knows anything! So, sure, they might recommend a pump that gets dumped, but they could just as easily promote a stock that moons. Nobody knows wtf they're talking about!

I think it's more advantageous for them to appear as reputable and trustworthy as possible and NOT shill stocks. That way, more people think they're legit and tune in. 

If there is anything underhanded going on, it would be convincing people like you and me that we can beat the indexes. The computers and algos know how to take advantage of retail investors much more handily than TV personalities can. And it's widely understood that the majority of stock-pickers underperform the indexes. Yet if you listen to these shows enough, their underlying message is clear.

Hope some of the new guys will get benefitted from my post who are less than 1 year in stock market and will learn a lot definitely from comment section if anyone share their experience. Here are from my experience -

1. **Always 30% Cash on hand. --&gt; Very Important  while everything is going down and I can't buy because  I got no money.** 

2. **Maximum 20% allocation on any stock.** 

3. **When I think about “Should I get out” is the right time to get out.** 

4. **Get out when you have achieved your target and take re-entry after 4 weeks minimum ----&gt; Locking profits** 

5. **Don’t buy in rush**. Observe and then take entry at good price. Stocks always gives a chance. Buy in 2 different stage. 50% + 50% 

6. **Don’t buy any stock that I will not hold for long.** Buy 50% of allocated capital (20%); when I buy and it goes deep down, buy the rest 50%. 

7. **Don’t fall in love with a stock**. 

8. **Don’t panic sell**; Never ever if you have high conviction on your stock selection. Those always came back and went even higher. 

9. **Once account gets bigger--- buy 50% index fund, 30% cash and 20% risky stocks** for high growth. 

10. Down trend Cycles in 2020 – September 3rd, 2.5 weeks before election Oct 2nd, from 2nd week of December. Cycles in 2021 --- Sell February 20th to re-entry March 8th , Sell March 16th to Re-entry March 25th , sell April 6th to re-entry April 20th, Sell April 28th to re-entry May 13, Sell June 17 to re-entry July 16th. **So, you see, there are lot of clear re-entry point.** It is hard to time the sell but need to sell when I’ve a descent profit and have a feeling time is getting bad. 

11. Long term secured big gains are possible only from blue stocks, established growth stocks and index funds/ ETFs**. Risky stocks are not for long term secured gains. So follow 80%/20% rule.**  

12. NO SHORT CUT

13. Payoff margin as soon as you have gains and can afford paying off. 

14. **Look at trading plan on regular interval and always follow, if you break blame yourself onlyyyyyyyyyyyy--&gt; So Never break**

I see a lot of people here being confused about pre-/post market. Allow me to explain. I was able to do so in the past and I hope it works this time as well. English is not my first language but I'll be using simple terms a kid would understand. I think it's what works best. 

Imagine you want to buy some fish. You come to a fish market before it opens. You've written a price you are willing to buy fish at on a cardboard. This is your bid. You see a few people gathered at the gate. Some of them are buyers like you with their cardboards. And some are selling fish and you can see their price tags on display - that's their ask price. You can also see a market price which is a price at which a trade happened. A trade is when a person who buys fish finds a person who sells fish at a matched price. For it to happen someone will have to give in. Negotiations happen. 

You look around and you don't see a price that satisfies you. You know that once the market opens you'll see how much fish is available for sale. If there is a lot of fish -&gt; the price will inevitably go down. If there is a shortage in fish -&gt; the price will inevitably go down. Before gates open you can't know how much fish will be on the market. You can only speculate. People at the gate might know more than you do or they might only appear like they know more than you do. Some of them think there will be a lot of fish, so they lower their prices much lower than the market price from yesterday. Sometimes they are right, sometimes they are wrong. Almost no one knows for sure how much fish will be for sale today.

As gates open up and everyone flocks inside you now see the actual picture. You see how much fish is being sold and how many people are willing to buy it. It is all about the demand - are more people willing to buy or are there more people willing to sell? Now it's time for buyers to meet sellers. People negotiate and thus move the market price higher or lower. If people know that the storm is coming and there will be a shortage of fish, it will be known before market opens up, so even those who showed up to a closed gate will know that the price will go higher and continue going higher by the end of the day. But on most days no one can know for sure how much fish will be brought in and how many people will want to buy it.

So here you have it. You don't know if those early birds are correct. They don't set the mood, nor they can confirm how much fish is going to be sold and bought that day. You see how those few people move the price for them, not for everyone involved. Therefore it's best to wait until the gates open and you can make a better judgement of what's going on. Better but still not perfect, because buyers and sellers come and go. Lunch time is typically slow, while by the end of the day people begin to have a better idea about how much fish is (still) available, so it picks up again. Sometimes there is a momentum when a lot of people are wrong - this is when you see a quick rise and fall. Or the amount of fish will fluctuate as more boats come in. 

Personally I try not to let premarket or post market prices affect me mentally. I don't get too upset if the price is suddenly 10% down from yesterday at a premarket, not do I get too excited if I see a price going 10% up after the market closes. Those prices are not a real reflection of the market. They only represent what happens outside the gate, among a few people. All that price means is what ""they"" were able to agree on. I wait for more ""players"" and more information to really show me what's going on. 

If you want to watch this in real life so to speak look at $MTN for example. You will see a huge gap between bid and ask prices at premarket. Wait until the bell and watch what happens. Bids and asks will begin to change, indicating who is giving in and who is gaining strength. Once a trade happens you will see a market price 

I hope this helps some of you understand what happens. This is just a tip of an iceberg and a very exaggerated simplification.

stocks,"**The Rundown (sources at the bottom):**

* 49.72% Short Interest
* Now the #1 most shorted stock (Not sure why [highintereststocks.com](https://highintereststocks.com/) has yet to list it. If someone knows, let me know)
* $38mil - $50mil market cap (For reference, GME and AMC are both in the billions)
* Closed today at $3.18

**Here's why I bought the dip today:**

The fact that it's now the #1 most shorted stock will certainly draw attention from the media and retail investors. If it was #4 or #5, I would be more on the fence. But being #1 comes with a spotlight.

Moreover, its very low price is also enticing to retail investors and its low market cap allows for immense volatility. We've seen how it's gone from roughly $3 to $7 in a single day. And now, it's currently trading at $3.18.

Considering that CRTD has a floor around $2.50 - $3 that it has pretty much never fallen through, it is a safe bet to buy in around this price. Then, factor in that it's the #1 most shorted stock and has a very low market cap, and you have what amounts to a short squeeze (a.k.a. the next CARV). All we need is some volume. That's why I'm here.

The company is obviously young and not profitable, hence why it is shorted. So there are, of course, some concerns that they could go under and investors would lose their entire investment. They acknowledge this in the most recent [10-K report](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001357671/000121390021018972/f10k2020_creatdinc.htm), but they also explain that they expect to ""have adequate financing for the next 12 months."" And with the [recent press release](https://www.nasdaq.com/press-release/creatd-inc.-hits-key-milestone-of-over-30000-vocal-subscribers-and-confirms-revenue) that touts an increase in revenue and a decrease in costs, they are not going under anytime soon (""soon"" meaning within the next month, at least, which is all the time we need for a squeeze anyway).

I am not an expert. I am not a financial adviser. But too many things are lining up for this shit to pop, and with how low the price is, y'all can make bank.

I ain't no bullshit artist, so let me know if any of this information is incorrect. I appreciate the advice.

# **Earnings could be the biggest driver for markets in the week ahead as investors watch bonds - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/16/earnings-could-be-the-biggest-driver-for-markets-in-the-week-ahead-as-investors-watch-bonds.html)**
*****
&gt; Stocks enter a busy week for earnings news with two perplexing questions hanging over the market.
*****
&gt; One is whether the big gains in corporate profits will start to boost stocks with solid earnings reports. That was not the case for some financial sector stocks this past week. The other question is whether the surprise decline in the 10-year Treasury note yield is sending a message that stock investors should heed.
*****
&gt; The benchmark 10-year yield, which moves opposite price, was at 1.30% Friday, after dipping below that level on Thursday. Stock indexes slipped for the week, with the S&amp;P 500 down nearly 1% and the Dow down about 0.5% for the week. The Nasdaq, which has typically benefited from lower yields, was off by more than 1.9% for the week.
*****
&gt; Stocks had a rocky day Friday, selling off into the closing bell. Defensive sectors, like health care, consumer staples and utilities gained in the session, while cyclicals, like energy and materials were hit hard.
*****
&gt; Airlines, railroads, drug companies and tech are among the many industries reporting results in the week ahead. Netflix reports Tuesday, while Johnson &amp; Johnson, Coca-Cola, and Verizon issue results on Wednesday. Intel and AT&amp;T report Thursday. American Express and Honeywell release quarterly earnings Friday.
*****
&gt; “Earnings have the spotlight in the coming week,” said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. “You’re not going to see economic data upstage earnings.”
*****
&gt; # Data takes a backseat to earnings
&gt; Among the handful of economic reports are housing starts Tuesday and existing home sales Thursday.
*****
&gt; Stovall said he is watching earnings report to see if stocks rally or languish after results. He said earnings for the S&amp;P 500 companies are now expected to be up more than 66% for the quarter.
*****
&gt; “I think what it means is investors are looking at this quarter as a peak quarter in the earnings cycle,” he said. “We’re getting what analysts had expected and then some, but because we are now on the leeward side of the earnings cycle, I think investors are probably going to be taking some profits because their expectations have been met and will not be exceeded in coming quarters.”
*****
&gt; James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at The Leuthold Group, said earnings may be more of a factor for stocks in the much quieter week ahead. In the past week, the market focus was on two days of testimony from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and important data, like the consumer price index and retail sales.
*****
&gt; # Bonds are in the spotlight
&gt; “I think the biggest issue is still going to be the 10-year bond yield,” Paulsen said. He said the key will be whether the 10-year yield falls back to its recent low of 1.25% or breaks above the important 1.4% level.
*****
&gt; “I think the continued drop in the bond yield is scaring investors overall — but particularly equity investors,” said Paulsen. The falling 10-year yield has recently been viewed favorably because lower interest rates are positive for tech and growth stocks. But the yield is now getting attention for continuing to move lower, contrary to the reflation trade and defying forecasts for higher yields.
*****
&gt; Bond strategists have been surprised by the decline, which they blame on a variety of factors. One is a massive repositioning by investors who were short the longer duration Treasury issues and were betting on higher yields. Another reason is there is less new issuance than expected from the Treasury.
*****
&gt; But there are also troubling worries about the economy.
*****
&gt; “What the heck is it telling us? The fears are it’s giving a better read on Covid and maybe a coming slowdown. Growth is good, while it’s not going to be near as good as people thought,” said Paulsen. One worrisome scenario factoring into the lower yields is that the Fed may be forced to tighten policy sooner than expected because of hot inflation, and that could slow the economy.
*****
&gt; Stovall said there’s a chance the bond market is sending a warning for stocks, and it is acting as a canary in a coal mine. But he also sees the yield reversing and moving higher.
*****
&gt; “Our belief is it will move higher by the end of the year, and economic growth will be strong,” he said. “I think the market will continue to watch that because interest rates are so crucial to intrinsic value models and it’s also doing what most people did not expect it to do.”

&gt; # Main Street Sentiment Remains Strong Despite Risks from Speedy Recovery

&gt; Sentiment on Main Street remains strong as the U.S. economy continues to move towards normalcy, but concerns about the impact of a strong but uneven recovery are rising as higher prices, supply chain bottlenecks, and trouble finding qualified workers weigh on businesses’ ability to expand.

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, Main Street sentiment is at its second highest level in over a decade according to LPL Research’s proprietary Beige Book Barometer (BBB), topped only by the June 2021 BBB reading. The result is based on our analysis of the Federal Reserve’s (Fed) Beige Book, a publication released two weeks before each Fed policy meeting that captures qualitative observations made by community bankers and business owners—what we like to think of as “Main Street” rather than “Wall Street.” The BBB gauges sentiment by looking at how frequently key words and phrases appear in the text.

&gt; In the most recent Beige Book, “strong” words had declined slightly while “weak” words fell to their lowest level since the BBB’s inception in 2005. However, expressions of uncertainty had increased and the report did note broad-based pricing pressures. Our sub-index of inflation-related words in the Beige Book remained at its highest level since we created the inflation sub-index in 2015.

&gt; “The economy is picking up speed but has not yet returned to pre-pandemic levels,” said LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “We expect the return to normalcy to continue to support economic growth, but the speed of the recovery also comes with some hazards.” (For more on LPL Research’s economic outlook and its potential impact on markets, see its recently released Midyear Outlook 2021: Picking Up Speed ).

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/7.16.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Mentions of COVID-related words (virus, COVID, pandemic) continued to fall in the most recent Beige Book, as they have in every Beige Book since January, even falling below the level of their initial appearance in March 2020. More concerning, in addition to the persistence of inflation-related words, supply chains also received frequent mention and mentions of shortages remained elevated. The downside of the economy’s rapid acceleration has been a mismatch between demand, which can ramp up quickly, and supply, which comes on line more slowly, while labor markets have also been slow to keep pace with reopening.

&gt; Nevertheless, the fundamental backdrop for the economy remains positive. Upside risks from inflation and disruptions from the Delta COVID variant are on-going risks, but we continue to expect inflation to start to subside as the economy normalizes. Global vaccine distribution will help limit the impact of the Delta variant, although it has led to some new restrictions. US economic acceleration will probably peak in the second quarter, but there’s still plenty of scope for growth to moderate and still remain above average. Much of the positive news is already priced in for equity markets, which are forward looking, and gains may not come as easily, but we still see solid potential for upside as the economy continues to rebound and potentially gains additional support from an improving global economy.

&gt; # A Check-In on Inflation

&gt; This week has provided investors with a fresh batch of data carrying the potential to heavily affect the inflation debate. Tuesday brought us the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for June, while Wednesday saw the release of the Producer Price Index (PPI) for June as well as the start of Federal Reserve (Fed) Chair Jerome Powell’s two-day testimony to Congress providing an update on the economy.

&gt; So has any of this materially changed our view (or the Fed’s) on the great inflation debate? Not really.

&gt; This may surprise some given CPI’s and PPI’s large beats relative to expectations, but at least for the next few months we believe that the composition of the inflationary increases is more important than the headline numbers. Headline CPI jumped 0.9% month over month vs. estimates of 0.5%, while core CPI jumped 0.9% month over month vs. estimates of 0.4%. Base effects from rolling off weak numbers a year earlier meant the year-over-year numbers were even more eye-popping. Meanwhile, headline and core PPI both rose 1.0% month over month vs. expectations for 0.5%. Under the hood, though, the theme of both reports is quicker-than-anticipated reopenings are stretching supply chains. The good news there is that those supply chain dynamics have the potential to improve quickly to meet demand and mitigate the lasting effects.

&gt; This is especially true in the auto, travel, hospitality, and food industries. Semiconductor shortages, which are already showing signs of subsiding, are driving shortages in both the new and used car marketplaces. As rental car companies increase their fleets to meet demand, they are increasingly being forced to bid up a limited amount of existing supply. Similarly, labor supply shortages in the leisure and hospitality sector, as well as airline travel, are restricting supply and causing prices to skyrocket. These components all tend to be relatively small parts of the overall CPI basket, but at the moment they are driving an outsized degree of the volatility.

&gt; All of these phenomena can be described as supply chain bottlenecks, which should eventually resolve themselves. For example, the elimination of supplemental unemployment benefits in September should help increase the supply of labor. Rent prices, though, have a greater impact on overall CPI as they account for 41% of the basket, and increases tend to have greater staying power. While they have risen slightly, they are still under control by historical standards, and play a major part in informing our view that inflation will eventually prove to be transitory.

&gt; Fed Chair Powell’s testimony did not break any new ground on the debate either. While the market did perk its ears up when Powell mentioned that the committee is in “active consideration” over when to begin tapering asset purchases, his characterization of inflation as being mainly transitory and affected by supply chain bottlenecks remained steadfast.

&gt; “The composition of recent data suggests that inflation will largely prove transitory as the Fed has stated,” said LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Just how long ‘transitory’ will prove to be is the big question. We are in the middle of the season when we expected to see some hot prints, so this week has not necessarily been a surprise. But with each passing report market participants will be increasingly anxious to see those numbers start to moderate.”

&gt; What is market pricing telling us about inflation? As seen in the LPL Chart of the Day, the market seems to be largely buying into the Fed’s narrative of transitory elevated inflation so far.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/7.16.21-Blog-2-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Breakeven inflation rates, market-based measures of inflation expectations over given timeframes, rose steadily until roughly the release of the April CPI report when we started hearing about peak inflation concerns. Though that report beat consensus estimates, the subsequent drop in both 5- and 10-year breakevens suggests the market accepted the Fed’s characterization of inflation as transitory.

&gt; And while the levels of these series can be volatile, we believe the divergence that began around the New Year is telling. 5-year breakevens began outpacing 10-year breakevens, suggesting that inflation may run hotter in the near-to-intermediate term, but that the market still has faith in the Fed to keep long-term inflation under control. 5-years making a new local high in the last week without 10-years following suit suggests that while the market is slightly concerned that transitory may prove to be longer than originally thought, it does not believe it will cause concerns on a longer horizon.

&gt; Rents and wages continue to be areas we monitor as tells on whether inflation may be “stickier” than the market anticipates. Our next good look into wage pressure comes on July 30 when we will receive the second quarter Employment Cost Index (ECI) from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. This report is important because it keeps the jobs mix it looks at constant. If there is wage pressure it may not show up in average earnings data if the job mix is shifting to lower wage jobs, as we likely have now, but the ECI would capture it.

&gt; # S&amp;P 500 Equalweight Lagging Badly

&gt; If you've been following the market over the last couple of months, you've likely noticed that the ""mega-cap"" stocks have been the main driver of the broad market's move higher. You can really see this trend when looking at the performance disparity between the cap-weighted S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and the equal-weight S&amp;P 500 (RSP). (Just to be clear, the main S&amp;P 500 index that's tracked closely across the investment landscape is a cap-weighted index, meaning larger stocks have a bigger impact on its performance than smaller stocks. The lesser-followed equal-weight S&amp;P 500 weights all 500 stocks in the index equally. In the equal-weight S&amp;P 500, Apple (AAPL) -- the largest stock in the index -- and Unum Group (UNM) -- the smallest stock in the index -- have the exact same impact on the index's performance.)

&gt; Yesterday was once again a bad day for most stocks as the equal-weight S&amp;P 500 (RSP) fell more than 0.90% on the day. At the same time, the cap-weighted S&amp;P 500 actually closed slightly higher on the day. As shown below, RSP has been stuck in a sideways pattern for the past two months, essentially going nowhere. SPY, on the other hand, has experienced a nice leg higher and is now very extended above its 50-day moving average. Over the last 12 trading days, SPY has closed at a new high 8 times while RSP has averaged a daily move of -0.02%. While the mega-cap growth stocks spent the time from late 2020 through early 2021 in consolidation, it's not the smaller cap stocks in the index that look to have fallen asleep.

&gt; While RSP has been trading sideways for the past couple of months, it's actually still slightly ahead of SPY on a year-to-date basis.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/07/rspspyytdchg.png))**

&gt; As shown below, RSP's YTD lead over SPY has been declining rapidly since peaking in May/June, however.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/07/rspspyytd.png))**

&gt; It's the last two months that have caused RSP to give up nearly all of its 2021 outperformance versus SPY. As shown below, RSP is only up 0.33% over the last two months, while SPY is up 4.64%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/07/rspspy2mth.png))**

&gt; The recent underperformance we've seen from RSP is definitely outside the norm. Below we show the rolling 2-month performance spread between RSP and SPY since RSP began trading in 2003. There have only been two other periods where we've seen the 2-month performance spread turn more negative for the equal-weight S&amp;P versus the cap-weighted S&amp;P. The first was in late October/November 2008 when the entire market was falling rapidly during the Financial Crisis. The second was in late March 2020 during the COVID Crash. These two examples show that we normally see RSP significantly underperform SPY like this when the broad market is falling; not when it's rallying to record highs on a seemingly daily basis.

&gt; # Fewer Bulls Without More Bears

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 is flat on the week but the index did tag record highs on Monday. In spite of this, sentiment has turned lower as the AAII survey showed bullish sentiment fall four percentage points to 36.2% this week. That took out the low of 36.4% from the week of May 27th to make for the lowest reading since the last week of October.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/07/071521-AAII-Bull.png))**

&gt; Some of those declines were picked up by bearish sentiment which rose to 26.8% from 24.5%. Whereas bullish sentiment is at one of the lowest levels in months, that is only the highest level in bearish sentiment since May 13th.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/07/071521-AAII-Bear.png))**

&gt; With bearish sentiment having risen only slightly while bullish sentiment experiences a more significant decline, the bull-bear spread has fallen to 9.4. That is at the low end of the past several months' range.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/07/071521-AAII-Bull-Bear.png))**

&gt; Instead, the losses to bullish sentiment have been picked up by the neutral sentiment camp as this week's reading topped 37%. While late May and early June saw similar to slightly higher readings, that level of neutral sentiment is elevated relative to the historical average of 31.43%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/07/071521-AAII-Neutral.png))**

&gt; Overall, the AAII survey has shown individual investors have become increasingly less optimistic, albeit not outright bearish, over the past few weeks. And while that may be the case for this group, equity newsletter writers have been another story. The sentiment survey from Investors Intelligence (II) covering this section of the market participantshas maintained a more optimistic outlook. This week, 61.2% of respondents reported as bullish which is the highest reading since April. That also comes in the top 5% of all readings since the start of the survey in the early 1960s.

&gt; In the chart below, we show the spread in the bullish sentiment readings of the AAII and Investors Intelligence surveys. This week, that spread fell down to -25 (meaning the percentage of respondents reporting as bullish in the AAII survey is 25 points lower than in the Investors Intelligence survey). That is the lowest reading in the spread since October and it is also in the bottom 5% of all periods.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/07/071521-AAII-II-Spread.png))**

&gt; There have been 20 times in which the spread has dipped below -25 without having done so in the prior six months. As shown, these instances are not particularly rare with about a year or two between each one. But what is notable about the current instance is how elevated the bullish sentiment readings are for each survey. As for what this means for the performance of the S&amp;P 500, in the near term performance has tended to have a negative bias, but moves higher are much more consistently seen in the months to a year after.

I've been buying GME at various points in time @ 40, 130, 200, ext and my average was at 170. I've been following it for a while now and saw some opportunity to make some money day trading it since it has been so volatile. 

In total, I have 180 GME. A couple of weeks ago I bought 50 @ 200 and sold 50 @ 210\~220 and I did this couple of times.  So fast forward now, GME has dipped down and now I see my average is well above 170 and now I am down a couple of grand instead of breaking even right now (plus the profit I should have made). I see now, when I sold, it sold my stock I bought @ 40 instead of when I bought at 200.

Volatility in the markets continued today, with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) falling for the third consecutive day after recording new intraday highs earlier in the week. The Dow Jones (DIA) also fell while the Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, continued its streak of underperformance, pulling back more than 1% for the fourth consecutive day. Market participants continue to digest Q2 earning reports, mixed economic data regarding inflation, and commentary by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. 

Ever since the release of the June Consumer and Producer Price Indexes (CPI &amp; PPI), which showed price inflation growing at a higher than expected clip, the market has become increasingly volatile, which is not super surprising given the SPY and QQQ have been on a remarkable rally as of late. The CPI, which measures changes in the prices of consumer goods, rose 0.9% in June, accelerating from May’s 0.6%. Year-on-year, the CPI is up 5.4%, exceeding the 4.9% expected by economists and the fastest rate of growth since 2008. Core CPI, which excludes the volatile price energy and food and is therefore considered a more accurate representation of general price inflation, was up 4.5% year-on-year as prices bounced from last year’s pandemic-era lows. PPI, which measures the average changes in prices received by domestic producers for their output rose 1% in June, accelerating to a 7.3% rise year-on-year, while still reflecting base effects. Core PPI rose 5.5%. This is the fastest rate of increase since 2009.

On a positive note, according to a report by the Department of Commerce, retail sales in the US unexpectedly increased in June, despite massive supply-side constraints affecting a swath of consumer goods, most notably, vehicles. The report showed spending was increasingly shifting back to services, like travel and entertainment, an encouraging sign that the reopening of the economy is going fairly well. Retail sales rose 0.6% in June, better than the decline of 0.4% expected by economists. Retail sales in the US are up 18% from June 2020, reflecting base effects as the economy continues to rebound from the pandemic-induced recession. 

Mike Loewengart, Managing Director of Investment Strategy at E-Trade Financial said, “*""*The unexpected rise in retail sales combined with yesterday’s pandemic-era low of jobless claims are two more strong proof points that we are edging closer to a full economic recovery. While we are seeing consumers broadly look more towards services and activities, the expectations that people would be turning away from goods seems to have been a little overblown.""

Earlier this week, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell gave his semi-annual monetary policy testimony before Congress, where he largely reiterated the same thing he has been saying for months. Powell said “inflation will likely remain elevated in the coming months before moderating” and that the US economy was “still a ways” off from reaching the threshold of “substantial further progress” that would trigger the Central Bank to roll-back pandemic-era policies. In short, Powell basically said while he expects higher inflation prints in the coming months, pressures are transitory and due to pandemic era disruptions and the Fed’s goal for economic recovery have not been met. [Here is Powell’s complete testimony, but here are two of his most important quotes.](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/testimony/powell20210714a.htm)

**On the labor market:** “Conditions in the labor market have continued to improve, but there is still a long way to go. Labor demand appears to be very strong; job openings are at a record high, hiring is robust, and many workers are leaving their current jobs to search for better ones. Indeed, employers added 1.7 million workers from April through June. However, the unemployment rate remained elevated in June at 5.9 percent, and this figure understates the shortfall in employment, particularly as participation in the labor market has not moved up from the low rates that have prevailed for most of the past year. Job gains should be strong in coming months as public health conditions continue to improve and as some of the other pandemic-related factors currently weighing them down diminish.”

**On inflation:** “Inflation has increased notably and will likely remain elevated in coming months before moderating. Inflation is being temporarily boosted by base effects, as the sharp pandemic-related price declines from last spring drop out of the 12-month calculation. In addition, strong demand in sectors where production bottlenecks or other supply constraints have limited production has led to especially rapid price increases for some goods and services, which should partially reverse as the effects of the bottlenecks unwind. Prices for services that were hard hit by the pandemic have also jumped in recent months as demand for these services has surged with the reopening of the economy”.

**Highlights**

* Ford Motors (F) issued three safety recalls affecting more than 800,000 in response to six injury allegations stemming from issues with the “rear suspension toe link which significantly diminishes steering control, increasing the risk of a crash.”
* Twitter (TWTR) and Square (SQ) CEO Jack Dorsey said SQ is launching a business dedicated to “decentralized financial services”. Through Twitter Dorsey said the company is “focused on building an open developer platform with the sole goal of making it easy to create non-custodial, permissionless, and decentralized financial services.”
* Tesla (TSLA) vehicle registrations in California rose more than 85% in the second quarter versus last year, largely due to the success of the company's Model Y, according to data from research firm Cross-Sell
* Import prices were up 1% in June over May, adding to a 1.4% increase the month prior. This marks the eighth straight month import prices have risen and brings the annual price increase to 11.2%
* Netflix (NFLX) has announced it plans to eventually stream video games on its platform and hired a former Electronic Arts (EA) executive to lead the push. 
* As earnings season continues, big bank stocks continue falling despite, in most cases, posting great earnings. 
* Microsoft (MSFT) is betting hybrid work will provide an opening to make its Windows operating system more widespread, launching a new service aimed at getting users of Apple (AAPL) and Android products to use the software. Windows 365, the company said, will be accessible on any device running any operating system that has a web browser, such as Apple Mac computers, iPhones and iPads, or those running Android software made by Alphabet (GOOGL)

stocks,"So, Boeing is currently trading at $218, and I was planning to get in anywhere below $225. The price seems like a good deal given that Boeing has plenty of outstanding orders, and that Boeing is also part of the duopoly that is the global aircraft manufacturing industry. They also have their defence division, which I think is a good safety net for them, I believe the US relies on them quite a lot.

Of course, their safety record is called into question slightly, but I feel that they’ve learnt from the 737 MAX. Boeing continues to have a good safety record, and continues to be dominant in the airline industry.

My one and only big concern is COMAC. I can almost guarantee to you that the CCP will push Chinese airlines to use COMAC aircraft. We don’t know how big COMAC can become in the future, but my first impressions of the company are very poor. Firstly, I can never see the US allowing anything of that sort into their airspace, or even getting FAA approval to start with. Secondly, COMAC looks like complete joke right now. They don’t even have a secure website, so the whole thing seems like a big fantasy project from China to try and compete with larger aircraft manufacturers.

However, everyone laughs at a company until it actually starts doing well. People laughed at Mark Zuckerberg’s idea, and now look where we are.

As of the end of Q1-21, PSTL’s owned portfolio was 100% occupied.

PSTL leases its properties nearly **exclusively** to the USPS with most leases being modified double-net leases, whereby the tenant (USPS) is responsible for utilities, routine maintenance, and the reimbursement of property taxes and the landlord (PSTL) is responsible for insurance, roof, and structure.

PSTL’s owned portfolio is split across last mile (&lt; 2,500 SF), flex (2,500 – 5,000 SF), and industrial (&gt; 50,000 SF) and as of May 4, 2021, split as a percentage of SF 19.8%, 50.8%, and 29.4%, respectively. At yesterday’s (July 15) close of $18.65/share, PSTL had an enterprise value of $399 million, including $98 million in debt and $4 million in cash (using Q1-21 balance sheet items).

**HERE’S WHY I LIKE THE STOCK**

* Q1-21 property net operating income (NOI) of $6.9 million (annualized to $27.6 million) translates to a 6.9% cap rate
* Q1-21 AFFO of $4.3 million (annualized to $17.2 million) translates to a 17.9x P/AFFO multiple
* Dividend yield of 4.7%
* Loan to value of 23%

Compare the above to another government-only REIT – Easterly Government Properties (NYSE: DEA). While DEA has exposure to more than just one government agency, they are trading at a 6.0% cap rate, 18.1x P/AFFO multiple, 4.7% dividend yield, and 32.9% loan to value.

While this may not seem like PSTL has **too much** room to run, consider a sum of the parts on their owned portfolio. We all know that the industrial sector has been on a tear recently and is the next big thing since sliced bread because of COVID and e-commerce acceleration, etc. PSTL’s 1.0 million square feet of industrial assets produced $4.5 million in annualized rent as of May 4, 2021. I’ll assume that this portion of the portfolio is triple-net (i.e., $4.5 million annualized rent = $4.5 million NOI) since that is how industrial properties tend to lease. Industrial REIT comps trade at an average 4.2% cap rate (note: the largest comp Prologis trades at 2.7%!), meaning the industrial portfolio within PSTL should be worth about $107 million.

Back to sum of the parts: considering the above, at yesterday’s price, you’re buying the rest of the PSTL portfolio of last mile and flex properties totaling 2.6 million square feet and generating $23.1 million NOI for $292 million or a **7.9% cap rate.** If this were valued at the same 6.0% cap as DEA, that is an **upside to PSTL of 30%.**

Some other great points – PSTL was just included in the Russell 2000 and management seems to be **extremely** invested. The CEO, Andrew Spodek, has been investing in USPS properties for 20 years and sits on the board of directors of the Association of United States Postal Lessors. Spodek is the largest individual investor owning 5.8% of the company. He also personally guarantees almost $3 million in PSTL’s indebtedness.

**RISKS**

I fully understand that PSTL’s single-tenant exposure is a risk. I understand that PSTL’s weighted average lease term remaining being only 4 years further compounds that risk. However, consider this:

* USPS made 100% of rent payments on time throughout the COVID-19 pandemic
* PSTL historic lease retention rate (going back to 2011) has been 98.4%
* USPS lease payments in fiscal year 2020 totaled approximately $1.4 billion, representing only 1.7% of the USPS’s total operating expenses so cost cutting programs at the USPS are unlikely to look at real estate first

I also don’t love that the majority of PSTL leases are double-net instead of triple-net.

The dividend AFFO payout ratio is also rather high at 84% so there’s not much room for the dividend to increase barring any fundamental changes.

**HERE’S WHY I REALLY LIKE THE STOCK**

Remember how I made a distinction between PSTL owned and managed properties? The 399 managed properties are also USPS-leased properties, but they are owned by the CEO’s family. The managed property count doesn’t seem to be growing so I’m not so worried about conflicts of interest between the CEO’s personal vs. PSTL acquisition pipeline.

PSTL is an internally managed REIT with $10.3 million in annualized general &amp; administrative expenses and 34 employees. This looks bad on its own and begs the question why they don’t move to an externally managed structure since their G&amp;A is almost 1/3rd of gross rent collections – way more than an external manager would charge (3-5% of collections). PSTL’s double-net lease structure does not justify this. While double-net requires more management than triple-net, consider that PSTL only had $372,000 in capital improvements in Q1 so it’s not like they’re busy round-the-clock managing construction projects.

Obviously, part of the G&amp;A can be allocated to the managed portfolio, but PSTL only collects an annualized $1.5 million in management fees from the CEO’s personal portfolio. This means that PSTL collects $3,750/year/managed property in management fees but spends $10,400/year/owned property on G&amp;A expenses.

While the CEO is heavily invested in PSTL, I do not think he is totally aligned with shareholders’ interests. It seems like *at worst,* he is using PSTL to subsidize his personal portfolio and *at best,* he is OK with a bloated and inefficient corporate structure. Look no further than PSTL’s **very active** Instagram page to see an example of an unnecessary G&amp;A expense. Not even PSTL’s behemoth REIT peers like Prologis, Realty Income, WP Carey have Instagram pages.

*So this sounds pretty terrible. Why do you really like the stock?*

**Because this makes PSTL a perfect take-over candidate for larger industrial or diversified REIT peers or any other institutional real estate investor.**

Where else can an investor acquire a 3.6 million square foot distribution/last mile network of real estate with locations in all 50 states that is 100% occupied and collected 100% of rents through COVID at a near-7 cap? **Nowhere.**

If you don’t want to bet on an acquisition… Remember how I said that PSTL was just included in the Russell 2000? This is giving PSTL a lot more attention. This is bad news for the CEO since more attention = more pressure on performance and more questions about his totally inefficient overhead structure. The top 10 institutional holders in PSTL own over 45% of the company. These institutions see the same numbers we see and must be asking themselves (and management) the same questions we’re asking. This should ultimately – whether there’s an activist campaign or not – create enough pressure on PSTL to fundamentally reshape their overhead structure and unlock significant cash flow for debt paydown, acquisitions, and/or dividend increases.

**This isn’t financial advice. I just like the stock. My position: 800 shares.**

stocks,"VIX is the volatility index and essentially measures the prices of S&amp;P500 options contracts, in an attempt to represent the volatility of the stock market. Volatility generally speaking is increased when stocks tend to fall more quickly as the broader market is normally on a slow uptrend. 

My question is this; historically, the VIX index rises to well above the 50 level in times of recession but always comes back down to earth in a recovery phrase. Is it not just free money to short it at these levels? Is the risk that the brokerage itself will not allow you to hold out until prices inevitably decline back lower?

### If you're one of the few who don't believe housing is in a bubble (like me), this is a home builder with an objectively cheap stock who, if able to manage their debt, is poised for a breakout.

**Company Overview**

**Market cap at publishing: $525M**

**Price at publishing: $16.78**

**1-Year Change: +50%**

Beazer Homes builds and sells residential homes in the U.S. They currently build in Arizona, California, Nevada, Texas, Delaware, Indiana, Maryland, Tennessee, Virginia, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina. The 13 states are segmented into three regions: West, East, and Southeast, with the West currently their busiest area. They have been building homes for over 25 years and while they have not, and may never again reach their ridiculous valuations of 2006 during the housing peak, I believe there is certainly a lot of potential here.

**Financials**

Here are some growth highlights from their fiscal 2nd Quarter results taken from their own presentation:

 [https://imgur.com/yEWpctm](https://imgur.com/yEWpctm)

 Some of my own comparisons of YoY growth: 

 [https://imgur.com/Frg4fj2](https://imgur.com/Frg4fj2)

 Big percentage increases across the board as should be expected since we are comparing with Q2 2020 i.e., the quarter that COVID really took hold. Don’t let that fool you though, Beazer Homes performed well YoY compared to the competition as well.

**Comparing the Competition**

Here is a quick growth comparison using the data above using one of the behemoths in the homebuilding sector, Lennar Corp (market cap: $31B)

 [https://imgur.com/uIngUDM](https://imgur.com/uIngUDM)

A lot of positive data to digest here as Beazer Homes holds up well against Lennar especially in FCF where Beazer more than tripled to $101.2M and Lennar actually fell to $93.7M. Keep in mind Beazer Homes has a current market cap of $537M vs. Lennar with a market cap of $31B (56x larger) with less FCF in Q2 2021.

Some more metrics and ratios that I like to use to compare against Lennar (TTM):

 [https://imgur.com/q2fG8zO](https://imgur.com/q2fG8zO)

So Beazer does very well in ROE, FCFM, but the other two metrics (operating margin and debt to equity) are admittedly pretty bad. The operating margin looks a bit better when you compare Beazer Homes to the industry instead of just Lennar. The industry average operating margin is 9.4% and the D/E average ratio is .86 (according to readyratios.com). That’s better but not great, which brings us to the company's weaknesses, Beazer Homes USA has an operating margin issue and a debt issue. If they can effectively tackle these problems which I believe they can, this company - and more importantly their stock price - has a very bright future.

**The Stock, I Like It**

BZH which is currently trading at $16.78 has a market cap of $525M. The stock is up 55% on the year but is still 52% off its 52-week high of $26.12. There is a reason I said the stock is objectively cheap in my thesis and the comparison below will really tell the story.

 [https://imgur.com/E6VVTXe](https://imgur.com/E6VVTXe)

The stock is trading at huge discounts as compared to the sector. Even the Price to book ratio is less than one meaning if you took the equity the company has and divided it by the number of shares then compared it to the current price, you would see that the current price is actually less. Seeing ratios like this tells the story of a company that is in a lot of trouble or the market is incredibly inefficient. Yes, markets are inefficient but not to this scale, which means that investors believe there is something horribly wrong with this company. Having studied their financials and read their filings, I would disagree with the market on this one. Debt is Beazer Home’s most pressing issue which is why I included ratios utilizing EV. Unlike earnings, enterprise value takes a company's debt into consideration and even when comparing EV ratios, the stock still looks cheap.

**Outlook**

So, what’s going on with Beazer Homes USA? Their comparative pricing metrics show they are heavily undervalued compared to the sector, their financials are up big YoY, and the CEO is giving positive statements about the future and raising EPS estimates. Well, the answer is twofold, they have a lot of debt and their margins are poor. The question then becomes will Beazer Homes be able to manage their debt and improve their margins? If you thought so, like me, then now might be a good time to invest in this company.

**They can manage their debt**

As of Q2 ‘21, their total liabilities stand at $1.4B with $250M of that being a revolver draw (similar to a LOC) that they haven’t accessed yet giving them a D/E ratio of 2.2. Compared to the industry average of .86 (according to finviz), obviously not good and certainly a cause for concern. One positive is that only $218M of this debt is a current liability, the rest is long-term debt. Beazer Homes is aware of their balance sheet and had they taken a passive approach to it, I wouldn’t be writing this article but they are not. As a matter of fact, the CEO set a target to reduce their debt to under $1B by FY 2022 and they are very much on track as we can see here

 [https://imgur.com/LXUbZLk](https://imgur.com/LXUbZLk)

They have the determination but what’s determination without capability? Now the question becomes, will they be able to continue paying down their debt? Well, companies need free cash flow to pay down debt and if this company's trend in free cash flow continues, they should be able to reduce their debt effectively as planned. 

[https://imgur.com/bepo5oX](https://imgur.com/bepo5oX)

As you can see they have solid annualized FCF growth and I don’t see any reason this would slow down any time soon with the current housing shortage, Biden’s infrastructure plan, and their commitment to improving their margins (you can see my future FCF estimates in the valuation section).

**Increasing margins**

Beazer Home’s other issue is its operating margin. The company is also aware of this issue and has been taking strides to improve its margins as seen in their EBITDA chart above and in the statement below

[https://imgur.com/eOCdmz](https://imgur.com/eOCdmzZ)

Some of the CEO’s statements regarding margins from their latest filing:

* “We had an extraordinary second quarter, driven by strong operational execution and continued strength in the housing market,” said Allan P. Merrill, the company’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “We generated significant growth in sales pace, average sales price, gross margin and adjusted EBITDA, leading to a doubling in our quarterly net income versus last year. At the same time, we improved our balance sheet efficiency by increasing our share of lots controlled by options while continuing to reduce leverage”
* “Homebuilding gross margin was 17.8%, up 170 basis points. Excluding impairments, abandonments and amortized interest, homebuilding gross margin was 22.2%, up 140 basis points”

**Some more bullish highlights:**

* Blackrock, Beazer Home’s largest shareholder added another 206k shares (8% increase) since their last filing
* CEO increased 2021 EPS estimate to $3.00 from $2.50 (implied earnings of $94M)
* Current housing shortage/high home prices
* Biden’s infrastructure plan includes more than $200B for housing
* Falling lumber and raw material prices
* April 2021 ENERGY STAR® Partner of the Year—Sustained Excellence Award from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Department of Energy for the sixth consecutive year

**Valuation**

I use Damodaran’s DCF analysis using free cash flow to firm to come up with a valuation. Here are the assumptions I made about future cash flows and all other inputs. Sorry, I know it’s not the prettiest but there is a method to my madness (I think). The present value I get from my analysis is $915M or $29.27/share which, compared to the current market cap of $532M or $16.78/per share, would represent a discount of 74%.

[https://imgur.com/UixEb5I](https://imgur.com/UixEb5I)

**I have a price target of $29.27 for Beazer Homes USA.** 

**TL;DR:** Cheap stock because of debt and margin issues that the company has committed to and is able to turn around based on their cash flows in my opinion.

stocks,"I've watched this stock, and have had some very good swing trades on it over the last year and despite it being near all time highs, I think it's a good buy. The company is in a unique position and is growing at a very good place. Nutritional snack bars and the likes have grown since the lockdowns have ended and people have begun to focus more on weight loss.

The stock is on a clear uptrend, and I believe that this will continue given the recent growth and profits. They do not pay a dividend, and I believe this company will be focusing on mergers now. The p/e is 40 and this is not a value play necessarily, but I do think that given the circumstances, they will grow into that, and the market seems to agree. 

I do not typically do DD on reddit, and I implore anyone with interest to look into them and form your own opinion on It. SMPL has been a resilient stock considering current market conditions and even with the delta variant being priced in, I think the valuation is sustainable. If it falls, I would love to buy more under $30-32. I initially started a position in this company at $21 a share and have since sold my entire position before reentering last week at a cost average of ~$36 a share. Selling puts on the down days may be a good way to sneak in a slightly cheaper cost basis. I also left cash on the side to buy dips, I do not view this as a very risky stock, but I cannot time the market and would like to be liquid enough to buy dips.

Usually I do not go for consumer Staples, but I have liked this stock and I like the trend. This is something different than what I usually post about as well, as I'm big on the oil trade right now, and I'll be honest, it's not going well. So I'm deciding to stop looking at that port for now and ride out the energy earnings and reevaluate in August. I digress.

A couple more picks I do happen to like in this market are  tobacco stocks like MO. 

I am starting to be more of a fan of defensive stocks, such as vertex pharmaceuticals and cigna, although I believe it may be too early in the market cycle to make these buys worth the opportunity cost, but they're safe, and very cheap relative to market. 

Disney is also one of my favorites, I'd be a buyer at these prices to be honest, it seems to have broken up a bit and seems to be holding above support on lower volume. 

Intel is one that I have always liked and I truly like it at this price. I will probably start a position soon. I like the idea of them being in the foundry business and I think that Intel will be able to shine a bit in the next 3-5 years.

stocks,"Good morning everyone, I am writing this at 5:45 AM, so I am not able to get all the news I normally get by 8AM. I still am going to be cautious as I have been all week. The earnings that have come out so far have been very good. It is unfortunate that the indexes have made new highs but this was without a broad market rally. There are about 12-13,000 tickers that trade on US Markets. Nasdaq near 5,000 NYSE near 4,000. However, many are still asking me what do I feel is going on... Unfortunately, the largest 25 stocks on the Nasdaq are near 52 week highs and carrying the index. The market breadth has been horrible. That is measured by the amount of advancers/decliners \[Green/Blue\] Since Fed Chairman has spoke, even on days we are in the green on the Nasdaq, making new highs, there are alot more decliners than advancers. Sometimes more than 3 to 1. I have wrote posts on how 5 stocks are close to 40% of the Nasdaq. \[AAPL, AMZN, MSFT, GOOG, FB\] So this is the divergence. That most worrisome factor for me is if these power houses go down and the Nasdaq comes down to 14,000 does it cause a widespread panic. The new all time high on the Nasdaq is near 14,800 so a correction now is about 13,300.

The earnings have been coming have been a huge beat, as much as last quarter which was the 3rd best since tracking of the SP500. It has been mostly banks and some others as well. It is extremely odd, because banks going into earnings have not rallied much, are making more money than ever, sales are high, these banks have the power to buy shares as well as raise dividends, but these banks are not taking off. The report by GS which by the way had the best earnings report last quarter, was even as good this quarter! Yes, GS did rally into earnings but after that report should still have been rewarded. Why? The company has the power to make 50+ dollars per share, trades around 380, and is still beating. As said earlier these banks/finance have cash to buyback, dividend or special dividend. Remember, the reason people ever get into the stock market in the first place is to earn money from a company that is going to share in the profits. Is SE, SNOW, LMND ever going to be able to do that? So why are they given an insane valuation is wordly. GS could pay everyone 25 dollars a share if they wanted and be fine! They currently pay $8! This is why we were supposed to invest from the start. If I was on the board, I would explore some different strategies to shoot up my stock, because at the end of the day the CEO's number #1 goal is to raise share price.

When a share price is high you can use your share price as currency to buy another company. When your share price is high you can sell it as an employee. The share price is high you can get talent by telling new highers they get a bonus with shares that will vest over time. When your company makes money, they can buy shares and issue them to employees and they can start this whole circle again.... so once again nothing is more important then a high share price. This is how GOOG, AAPL, MSFT, AMAZN, FB have got talent, made acquisitions, using the shares as currency! In 2021 there have been more offerings than ever, especially with companies with horrible financials to raise cash, because once again, high share price. The importance of this is because these banks and financials, have a way to increase share price because their businesses bring cash! These are the companies that should be rewarded for + cash flows and amazing earnings. It does stump me how a CRWD, NIO, TSLA, TWLO are insanely high.

Yesterday, I was trading ZIM, NYCB and NYMT. I will continue to do today. I also did trade TIGR who had 250% sales growth and was profitable. Honestly, I was shocked that GS would give TIGR a sell rating and a $21 target. How do they arrive at this number? I would absolutely love to know.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

stocks,"GXO Logistics will sell shares to the public for the first time Aug. 2 on the New York Stock Exchange, executives said during an investor day presentation July 13.

XPO Logistics Inc. has been working for nearly a year to spin off the global contract logistics operations into its own publicly traded company.

“The spinoff will establish GXO as the largest pure play logistics company with around 5% of the $130 billion of logistics that’s currently outsourced in our key geographies,” said Malcolm Wilson, CEO of the GXO business. “We will be the second-largest contract logistics company in the world.”

Wilson

“GXO has a broad geographic presence that allows us to meet the needs of our global customer base,” Wilson said. “Importantly, our scale makes us one of only a handful of global players that can satisfy the logistics requirements of the world’s largest multinational companies.”

Wilson said the new company can support more than 200 million square feet of warehousing space across nearly 900 locations worldwide and close to 100,000 workers.

GXO was first registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on June 9.

Mark Manduca, who will become GXO’s chief investment officer, told Transport Topics the day after the presentation there was a real appreciation in the market.

“The feedback so far has been extremely strong. We’re very grateful to have phenomenal investors, obviously as part of core XPO, who were extremely supportive. So feedback so far has been good.”

This spinoff that’s taking place now is creating two powerhouse companies.

Malcolm Wilson, CEO of GXO

Manduca said the main area of debate has been the valuation. The process of determining the value of the company will take place over the next few weeks.

“The opportunities for a business that has revenues of around $8 billion is phenomenal going forward,” Manduca said.


He highlighted during the investor day presentation how the logistics company uses a collaborative approach, bringing together sales, implementation and technology expertise to provide solutions tailored to a customer’s current and anticipated needs. He also noted contract terms gives the company outstanding revenue visibility in the near and medium term. Some recent contracts even extend into the five- to 10-year range.

The GXO executives finished the presentation focused on projected growth, cash flow, where there are scale opportunities and the benefits of having the contract logistics operations become its own company.

“This spinoff that’s taking place now is creating two powerhouse companies,” Wilson said. “It allows us to implement our own optimal capital structure, investment identity, the resources, allocation of strategies.”

stocks,"# Origin Materials

Origin’s decarbonizing technology addresses a \~$1 trillion market opportunity, and is anticipated to revolutionize the production of a wide range of end products, including clothing, textiles, plastics, packaging, car parts, tires, carpeting, toys, and more.Origin now has partnerships with Nestle, Danone, and Pepsico who are some of the largest plastic users in the world. Match that with their connections from their board, they have the chops to make this work and scale

Origin Materials have developed technology out of UC Davis which creates plastics out of scraps of organic material:

1. wood pulp
2. rice hulls
3. sugar cane stalks, etc.

This process ends up capturing the carbon that would reenter the atmosphere when the scrap material decays into plastics making it an incredibly effective way to capture carbon. Deloitte did some independent analysis and showed it captures 300% of the carbon used in the manufacturing process making it one of the first carbon **negative** production processes!

Not only that, but since they are using scrap material the production costs are not tied to inflation or any other material such as oil.

In fact, they estimate producing these bioplastics at a cost which will be competitive with current oil based plastics - and that doesn’t even include any carbon credit incentives!

Origin is currently building the Origin 1 plant due EOY 2022 which will be their testbed plant that is focused on refining and optimizing their full scale production for both current and future materials. From there, EOY 2024 will mark the completion of their Origin 2 plant which will be a full production scale facility and also create a positive EBITDA. From there, they plan for 5 more plants estimating a $2.3bln EBITDA by 2030! This company has the potential to absolutely boom!

**Leadership**

These folks know their chemistry. Lots of names out of UC Davis where this tech was developed, so this isn’t just some pipe dream MBA bullshit. They also have lots of leadership out of the chemicals production space from the likes of Dow Chemicals. So that’s great on that level, but how do we know they will actually be able to execute?

1. Board Chair - Karen Richardson who is also a board member of BP.
2. Boon Sim - Leader for both Credit Suisse and Temasek Holdings - aka the sovereign wealth fund of Singapore which is known for being one of the most sophisticated funds in the world.
3. Along with that, execs from Clorox, Dupont, and P&amp;G. So tons of experience and connections with huge players. I was on the fence until I saw who was on the board - now I’m stoked.

**Insider Buying and Investment**

1. Just before merger, Charles Drucker bought an additional 650k shares bringing his total ownership to 18.862,500 shares.
2. On top of that, Apollo Funds invested $30m in Origin furthering my confidence in the company.
3. On June 25th, Lior I. Amram and Evergreen InvestCo bought 10m shares furthering the large long term investments in the company.

# Ridiculously Tiny Float

# The current available float is sitting at 29m - but wait, there’s….Less?

# With the buying mentioned above, this is reduced to only 18.23m shares.That is tiny! We are only starting to get a sense for institutional ownership. There just aren’t that many shares available right now so that means the price will be heavily affected by even a small increase in demand. More volatile? Yes, but also will make a runup in price all the more likely.

**Market**

The market is currently pegged at $1tln of potential, so there is tons of room for expansion. But let’s take a look at Danimer Scientific who was another company which merged last year and also looks to produce bioplastics. If you look at their investor presentation you can see they are further along, but their maximum production after all their facilities are built is just a little above what one of the 6 production plants of Origin. And on top of that they have to use vegetable oils, so are prone to crop inflation. Right now they are valued at $25 which according to their data puts them at a 14x multiple of their future EBITDA and a 15% discount rate. The same comparison would put Origin up over $40 a share today.

Origin is primed to cash in on the current boom, Their current projects look to **double** in EBITDA when forecasting for the potential of carbon capture premiums and other environmental opportunities. They can also license their technology to other companies since there is a huge market which one company can never fill. When looking at the demand, they have already gotten $1bln in offtake commitments - and while they could have more - they have chosen to reserve capacity for higher margin items.

On top of all that, Origin now has partnerships with Nestle, Danone, and Pepsico who are some of the largest plastic users in the world. Match that with their connections from their board, they have the chops to make this work and scale. And to go along with that, the merger (with warrants) will provide them with enough funding to get to their EBITDA positive timeframe with another $250mln in buffer. So there is very little risk of dilution via share issuance.

Beyond their factories, they are also looking at licensing hte technology for another revenue stream to further accelerate growth (none of my calculations take this into account). The potential for additional revenue is just absolutely massive since there is a $1 ***TRILLION*** addressable market opportunity. Once in a lifetime opportunity.

**Competitors**

Origin doesn’t have any direct competitors, but it does have some analogs. Danimer Scientific is one, but their focus is on biodegradable plastics. They use canola oil as their feedstock so their price is tied to the price of the commodity - and even at relatively low costs today they still cost $1/lb vs $0.29/lb for Origin. Also, there are a ton of products that **shouldn’t be biodegradable** \- car parts for example shouldn’t be degrading! Purecycle is another analogue, but has the same issues as Danimer Scientific.

In the end, there is **no other company that is looking to make carbon negative plastics**.

**Elephant in the Room**

Plastics are an environmental problem. There are microplastics that are increasing in concentration in the ocean and in ocean life specifically and they have become a disease on the planet. Why am I okay with this personally for Origin? Well simply, it is a step in the right direction. There are a large number of applications which require non-biodegradability but ultimately this begins to get market penetration with **zero modification** for carbon reduction. It’s a trade off for sure, but it’s only the start.

Things start to look much better with net zero fuel pellets and water filters, carbon black, and agricultural applications which (aside from the fuel) are all carbon negative. In the end, this is an insanely huge step towards reducing our carbon footprint and right now that takes priority for me

**Risks**

They currently have no revenue and are building their first plant, Origin 1. This plant is still just a testing plant and they are quite far away from revenue positive. The plant was also delayed a year, likely due to COVID, but they now have the equipment on site.

**Overall**

There is a huge push for countries and companies to reduce their carbon footprint, and this company is set to not only make a very profitable and sustainable product - but to also capture a shitton of carbon doing it. In the long run this company is likely going to explode in value as they have the talent, experience, and in demand product.

There are real risks here, but the upside is **enormous** as this is a true potential unicorn. I’m looking at a potential return of 10-30x

stocks,"Payoneer is a payment platform that offers a way for businesses to pay and receive money, for a low fee. Payoneer believes that the total addressable market (defined as global e-commerce volume) is $26 trillion a year. Payoneer processed over $44 billion in 2020 alone.

Payoneer works with 9 of the top 20 most valuable companies. Alongside these big names, Payoneer also has 5 million+ marketplaces and businesses, across over 190 countries.

Payoneer also offers:

* Accounting integrations
* Capital to small businesses
* Regulatory and compliance infrastructure
* Physical debit cards
* Tax solutions

So, it is basically a bank that includes an accountant to help meet a business’ needs. The one product or feature that is missing is digital coins and no doubt they will be offering that soon, if anything they should make that a major priority.

**Management Team**

Scott Galit - CEO of Payoneer, previously a senior VP at MasterCard. Serious financial services pedigree.

Michael G Levine - CFO of Payoneer, ex-City VP and ex-CFO of Maler Technologies. MBA from Wharton.

Betsy Cohen - Tons of finance related experience, including founding Bancorp. Should be able to give Payoneer great advice for future growth.

**Customers**

Payoneer has some big name clients, including but not limited to:

* Amazon Europe
* Google
* eBay
* Walmart
* Upwork
* Fiverr
* AirBnB
* Booking.com

Weird right, they work with Ebay given Paypal does too. This is because they work with countries and specific clients that Paypal not accept into their platform. Investors need to understand that sometimes people have to use other platforms because they the Paypal’s or banks are NOT willing to take the risk. Sure the risk is probably higher but the amount of people that need access to capital or payment process is high when many banks in many countries do not approve people for such type of access.

**Switching Costs**

Integrating, setting up, and teaching staff how to use a new payment platform can be time-consuming and expensive for businesses. Therefore, when a client is set up on Payoneer, it is unlikely that they will switch to another provider. This is best seen by the &gt;100% volume retention that Payoneer has (i.e. customers stay and increase their payment volume).

**Brand**

Payoneer, from what I have seen, has a strong brand (though this is obviously a subjective factor). This idea is reinforced by the presence of their big name clients. Branding is really important in FinTech, businesses need 100% confidence when money and payments are involved. This offers not only stops entrants into their market, but should also facilitate future growth and customer acquisition.

**Network Effect**

Imagine company A is on Payoneer and wants to pay company B. Company A suggests payment through their usual payment processor, Payoneer. Company B now signs up to Payoneer and decides to do all their payments through it etc. This is the network effect that Payoneer enjoys. This is a very powerful barrier to entry - very difficult to overcome, while also hard to create yourself.

**Geographies**

UNSUBSTANTIATED: Conversations on Reddit leads me to believe that Payoneer has a strong presence in Asia. If anyone has evidence, please put it in the comments.

If this is true, it should give Payoneer an edge in capitalising on the future growth of the emerging markets.

Some evidence:

* The CEO has gone on record saying Korea is one of their big market focuses.
* Achieved triple digit growth each year in the asian markets from 2012-2016.

# Valuation and Financials

# Enterprise Value: $3.29 billion

# Projected 2021 revenue: $432 million

# EV/2021 revenue multiple: 7.6x

# 2019-2020 revenue growth: 8.8%

**Institutional Ownership**

Payoneer has some institutional giants already invested, including Wellington Management, Dragoneer Investment Group, Fidelity Management and Research, Temasek, and Franklin Templeton.

**What do I think the future holds for Payoneer? I actually think there are several exits for this company.**

1. **Growth**: The company continues to grow and eventually reach billions of revenue within 5 to 10  years.
2. **Consolidation**: Large international payments processer buys them. Could be Paypal, Square,      Stripe, First Data, etc. consolidation WILL happen in this space and I  think short-term Payoneer will acquire some companies and then be sold to a bigger company. Think of this as how banks in the USA were allowed to merge in 1995 given the law that passed. Before you had 100,000 banks then it was 50,000 banks, then 10,000 banks, and now like 5,000 banks but the top 10 banks make up a large % of the business/volume.
3. **Wildcard**: CRM business buys them. What many people do not realize is that CRM’s have been changing the game. First, it was to help you sell with marketing tools, then it is to improve communication within the team, then it will be stored, and legal transactions then it will be a financial transaction.      They are literally going to control the beginning to the end of the customer relationship and all of that data they possess is very valuable to help their customers grow.

Stocks broadly fell today as market participants continued digesting Q2 earning reports, reassurances from the Federal Reserve that current inflationary pressures is temporary and new economic reports that suggest a slowdown in the global growth rate. After recording several new intraday highs this week, the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) slipped, closing 0.34% and 0.7% down respectively. The Russell 2000 (IWM) fell for the third straight day this week, closing 0.54% down.

Markets seem to have become jittery following the release of the June Consumer and Producer Price Index (CPI &amp; PPI). (CPI), which measures changes in the prices of consumer goods, rose 0.9% in June, accelerating from May’s 0.6%. Year-on-year, the CPI is up 5.4%, exceeding the 4.9% expected by economists and the fastest rate of growth since 2008. Core CPI, which excludes the volatile price energy and food and is therefore considered a more accurate representation of general price inflation, was up 4.5% year-on-year as prices bounced from last year’s pandemic-era lows. PPI, which measures the average changes in prices received by domestic producers for their output rose 1% in June, accelerating to a 7.3% rise year-on-year, while still reflecting base effects. Core PPI rse 5.5%. This is the fastest rate of increase since 2009.

Yesterday, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell gave his semi-annual monetary policy testimony before Congress, where he largely reiterated the same thing he has been saying for months. Powell said “inflation will likely remain elevated in the coming months before moderating” and that the US economy was “still a ways” off from reaching the threshold of “substantial further progress” that would trigger the Central Bank to roll-back pandemic-era policies. In short, Powell basically said while he expects higher inflation prints in the coming months, pressures are transitory and due to pandemic era disruptions and the Fed’s goal for economic recovery have not been met. [Here is Powell’s complete testimony, but here are two of his most important quotes.](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/testimony/powell20210714a.htm)

**On the labor market:** “Conditions in the labor market have continued to improve, but there is still a long way to go. Labor demand appears to be very strong; job openings are at a record high, hiring is robust, and many workers are leaving their current jobs to search for better ones. Indeed, employers added 1.7 million workers from April through June. However, the unemployment rate remained elevated in June at 5.9 percent, and this figure understates the shortfall in employment, particularly as participation in the labor market has not moved up from the low rates that have prevailed for most of the past year. Job gains should be strong in coming months as public health conditions continue to improve and as some of the other pandemic-related factors currently weighing them down diminish.”

**On inflation:** “Inflation has increased notably and will likely remain elevated in coming months before moderating. Inflation is being temporarily boosted by base effects, as the sharp pandemic-related price declines from last spring drop out of the 12-month calculation. In addition, strong demand in sectors where production bottlenecks or other supply constraints have limited production has led to especially rapid price increases for some goods and services, which should partially reverse as the effects of the bottlenecks unwind. Prices for services that were hard hit by the pandemic have also jumped in recent months as demand for these services has surged with the reopening of the economy”.

In other news, new economic data coming out of China, the first country to experience and begin recovering from the virus, is showing a marked slowdown in economic growth. The world's second largest economy expanded at a 7.9% rate in the second quarter from a year ago, according to the National Bureau of Statistics, missing consensus estimates for an 8.0% rise and decelerating sharply from the first quarter's 18.3% increase. In response, the People’s Bank of China signalled it was cutting the amount of cash that banks must hold in reserve, a move that suggests the economic recovery in China may be slowing down. The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) will reduce the reserve requirement ratio by 0.5 percentage point for most banks, according to a [statement](http://www.pbc.gov.cn/goutongjiaoliu/113456/113469/4287599/index.html) published Friday. That will unleash about 1 trillion yuan ($154 billion) of long-term liquidity into the economy and will be effective on July 15, the central bank said. The reduction was signaled earlier this week, when the State Council, China’s equivalent of a cabinet, hinted the central bank would make more liquidity available to banks so they could lend to smaller firms hurt by rising costs. The timing and magnitude of the move, coming a week before second-quarter growth data, suggests worries about the economy’s outlook and was a decisive shift away from policy tightening, which most, if not all, recovering economies are pursuing.  Just to put into more familiar terms, this would be like if the Federal Reserve suddenly turned around and said rather than discussing tapering quantitative easing, it would instead propose pumping more money into the economy.

In good news, the Weekly Unemployment Report showed new jobless claims fall to pandemic-era lows. 

* **Initial jobless claims, week ended July 10:** 360,000 vs. 350,000 expected and a revised 386,000 during prior week 
* **Continuing claims, week ended July 3:** 3.241 million vs. 3.300 million expected and a revised 3.367 million during prior week

**Highlights** 

* Import prices were up 1% in June over May, adding to a 1.4% increase the month prior. This marks the eighth straight month import prices have risen and brings the annual price increase to 11.2%
* Netflix (NFLX) has announced it plans to eventually stream video games on its platform and hired a former Electronic Arts (EA) executive to lead the push.

Content creators will receive a monthly bonus if they hit milestones for earnings Stars, a form of digital tipping that fans can use to pay their favorite creators during live-streamed videos. Instagram's bonus programs will include incentives to use Reels, its copycat TikTok feature that showcases short-form video clips. Creators will earn money based on how their Reels videos perform, the company said.
* Microsoft (MSFT) is betting hybrid work will provide an opening to make its Windows operating system more widespread, launching a new service aimed at getting users of Apple (AAPL) and Android products to use the software. Windows 365, the company said, will be accessible on any device running any operating system that has a web browser, such as Apple Mac computers, iPhones and iPads, or those running Android software made by Alphabet (GOOGL)

stocks,"I want to share the story of Netlist and the real value of its patents (patent 912 is perhaps one of the inventions of the century as it was used / stolen by google and as it allowed it to become so big and important in the world).

How did Google rise to the top of the search engine wars? Simple. Google cheated. A small company called Netlist in California developed some leading edge computer memory technology. That technology would let computers and servers of the day access 4 times more RAM (Random Access Memory) than the computer could normally access. Netlist met with Google regarding this technology. They showed the technology to Google in order that Google might license the technology from Netlist. Google didn't license it. Google stole it. Google copied it, had it manufactured, and used it in their servers. Google was caught with Netlist IP in their servers when the court ordered a random check of Google servers that were in operation at that time. Google, with Netlist IP, now had the fastest search engine on the Internet, and went on to leverage that speed and savings to become the giant, powerful company they are today.

Netlist has battled Google for over 10 years to reclaim their intellectual property, and regain the value that their IP should have provided their bottom line and shareholders for many years. Google continued to try and run out the clock, hoping that Netlist would go out of business, or abandon the costly litigation. Netlist has abandoned nothing. Now the tables have turned and the clock is running out on Google. Google lost their latest appeal of the '912 patent at the U.S. Federal Circuit Court of Appeals (Federal Circuit), which upheld the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) affirmation of the patent's validity. Google did not appeal this ruling to the United States Supreme Court, and now the patent has been recertified by the US Patent Office. The trial in the Northern Disctrict of Califonia to determine the level of infingement, and the damages owed to Netlist by Google, has been reopened.

""For ten years Netlist has steadfastly opposed Google's misguided campaign to invalidate the ‘912 patent,"" said Netlist's CEO, C.K. Hong. ""We are very pleased that in the end the appellate court made it clear that the claims of this seminal patent are indeed valid and in so doing, further vindicate our decade-long defense of the company's strategic intellectual property. We will now move to lift the stay in the patent infringement lawsuit against Google in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of CA., in order to recover current and past damages related to the ‘912 patent.""

This is more of a general question on how options wash that were purchased less than 30 days before expiration.

For example, say I bought 1k in weekly options on Monday, and they expire worthless on Friday. Since this option was purchased less than 30 days before expiration, does this expiration wash? Or is it able to be written off at a loss?

To continue the question, what if I bought 1k on Monday, and another 1k on Tuesday, does only the first or second batch wash? All of it wash? Or none?

I realize this may be a silly question, just something I have been wondering about for awhile. Please note these are examples and not what I actually did haha.

So I was re-evaluating my portfolio and viewing others portfolios and I noticed that my ""riskier"" speculative plays take up a much larger percentage of my portfolio than most.

I would say about 30% are in speculative/disruptor plays. 

I think I have failed to lose the ""play risky"" mindset I had when I was pretty much broke and almost day trading.  

This has served me well to get to a very comfortable amount but I always swore once I reached this specified number I would play it safer to grow slower but with less risk of losing large amounts (I can stomach losing a couple of hundred a day but losing thousands does cause me sleepless nights)

stocks,"Some general Info about HIMS-

Hims &amp; Hers ($HIMS) is a telemedicine company which allows anybody across the continental United States(and soon to be UK and Europe) to purchase medicine discreetly, safely, quickly, and inexpensively straight to your door. For prescription medicine, Hims &amp; Hers employs hundreds of specialized doctors, which can prescribe medicine through call, text, or video chat. Hims &amp; Hers offers a wide variety of products which continues to expand, such as:

-Hair Loss and Care

-Sex products (ED, PE, Birth Control)

-Skin Care/Acne products

-Covid Tests

-Supplements

-Primary Care

-Mental Care

etc...

So I wanted to do some DD because Earnings should be coming out sometime early-mid august and I expect this to be the first quarter where they can show positive EBITDA, I would expect nothing less than absolutely stellar numbers across the board, with a highlight on YoY revenue growth.

- Customer acquisition, expanding their base of users and subscriptions by expanding into multiple sectors of mens, womens and even mental health

- Bridging the gap between being a telehealth provider and the standard retail brick and mortar model, by establishing partnerships with companies like Target and Urban outfitters putting their products in these big box stores that we all shop at.

- Acquiring companies like Apostrophe, which is a multi-specialty telehealth platform, it was also a competitor, well not anymore now HIMS is the parent company. (Remember how FB liked to buy out all of their competition until they became the biggest platform on the planet... ya HIMS is taking a page straight out of the Zuck's playbook)

- Future Growth prospects; HIMS is expanding into the UK and Europe giving them access to a greater reach of customers, and as we all know, balding, ED, Acne, etc... is not something there is a permanent cure for and something a lot of people suffer from, with a subscription based model they're basically able to lock in long time recurring customers, so you put 2 and 2 together, you put the product in more countries, you get more subscribers.

- Before you tell me that HIMS hasn't turned a profit BLA BLA BLA, Let's look at their last earnings report.

Financially stable - over 90 Million in cash on hand + short term investments, with 0 short/long term debt
Gross Margin of 77% last Quarter, 74% for 2020 (54% in 2019)
2.6B Market Cap
Negative (but improving) Cash Flow
Q4 EPS of -.07 (Beat by .09)
Revenue of $148.8 MM for 2020, 80% yoy growth
2020 Q4 Revenue of $41.5 MM (Beat by $4.47 MM)
Q1 2021 Revenue expects $48 - $50 MM
$195 - $205 MM overall 2021 Revenue estimate
Over 3 Million consultations
91% Recurring Revenue

Simply put, Hims &amp; Hers has consistent, growing revenue and gross margin growth, and the driving factor for their negative EBITDA are their investments into furthering expansion, customer acquisition/company acquisitions that will only help solidify their cash flow and subscription services on the back end in the future.

Last point, just from a trading perspective, HIMS is down thirty percent the last month, and went down 8 percent today, Now is the time to buy a few weeks before a potentially huge earnings report, and with 52 wk low of 8.09, It's definitely at or near the bottom right now. Please note, this isn't a fucking short squeeze BUT the short interest 13% which is kind of high...

(Important) A DD post was made explaining my the divi COULD be $35 a share. This is big and here’s why. If the dividend amount is released that it is $35 a share the price will go ballistic. Call options bought before the ex. Dividend date have 100 dividends attached. If the divi is this high then call options even $5 otm will be exercised to try and get that extra $3500 for free. This will be the gamma squeeze will might see on Friday due to options expiring.

(Short squeeze) tomorrow makes the start of the t21 rules for ftd’s this should make shorts start covering. The (possible) gamma squeeze should scare shorts into covering and this is called a double whammy squeeze. Big gains there! NFA

(The kicker) mmat is a metamaterials company. They make materials that cannot be found in nature and the potential for these materials are endless. This company is in the tech and semiconductor category on the nasdaq and if you look at other stocks in this sector you will see that none are below $50. Mmat is seriously undervalued and they barely have any competition (almost none). This company is worth $75 easy but I personally say they are worth $100 a share. I’m am not a financial advisor! But mmat (this might kill some of you to hear) will probably squeeze bigger than amc. But most of us are in it for the long run. This is like owning aapl or amzn at $4.37 a share!! This company will be known more well than Facebook in 10 years (or less). Again these are my claims and not guaranteed.

When they report Q2 2021, they'll cycle through the horrible Q2 2020 numbers due to pandemic... meaning the trailing twelve month EBITDA will go up 33% (if my projections of Q2 2021 that is at minimum on par with Q1 2021 is true... changing my adjusted TTM EBITDA to actual TTM EBITDA) and that'll get picked up by the quant trading machines.  And management could start going on the road to market the stock after focusing on debt refinancing over the course of the last year or two after their first earnings call in August 2021.  

***CPI Card Group.  Ticker: PMTS.***  \~$200M market cap.  $300M+ revenues.  Adjusted EBITDA of \~$80M (adjusted meaning stripping out impact of Q2 2020 when everyone had a crap quarter - Q3 20 $17M, Q4 20 $17.5M, Q1 21 $22M and if you assume trend is new normal, then Q2 21 is $20M or so).  Last quarter, revenues up 20%, EBITDA up 78%, Op Inc up 137%, adj net income up 337% (adjusted for one-time refinancing costs of debt).  Refinanced their debt 3/2021 and have 5 years on their net $300M of debt.  While debt looks like a lot, remember Debt/EBITDA is only 3.75x - which will continue to down as EBITDA continues growing.  

They make plastic credit cards.  In 2015/2016, the industry moved to EMV (Europay, Mastercard, and Visa) chips - the little chips you see on the right side of all your credit cards.  Manufacturers ramped up capacity.  Industry pulled forward demand and bought a ton of cards.  EMV chips lasted longer than magnetic stripes and expiration of cards went from 3 years to 5 years - reducing demand for cards significantly.  Industry was destroyed due to reduction of demand while supply went up.  #1 and #2 players Thales/Gemalto and Idemia both converted a bunch of their capacity to make drivers licenses and other forms of ID and took capacity out of the credit card industry.  CPI was weakened because they had debt from a dividend recap.  In 2017, CPI interest expense was higher than their EBITDA.  Company is hurtling towards bankruptcy.  

In late 2017, one of their board members who had retired as CFO of Western Union (and before that First Data - so CFO of two Fortune 500 companies and a real exec...) comes out of retirement and jumps in as CEO.  So what happens?  CPI is hurtling towards bankruptcy and probably would have gone under except for the pandemic.  Why?  

Pricing on EMV chip cards had gone to crap and there was little profitability.  Prior CEO had tried to tell people that contactless cards was going to save the company's hide, but reality was that NO ONE wanted to pay for contactless cards or the terminals.  Most of the merchants had credit card readers / terminals that could read contactless, but it cost $150-200 in software to turn on the functionality.  Only maybe 30-40% of the terminals in late 2019 had the software installed.  

What changed?  The pandemic!  Now getting out of the store quickly and making consumers comfortable with going into stores is important.  Not only does going contactless mean that you don't have to stick the card in that little slot and have to stand next to the cashier, but contactless transactions also go faster.  That's why retailers now are paying for the terminals.  By mid-2021, I've seen estimates that say 80% of retailers now have contactless readers.  

For the card issuers, contactless and the pandemic is a chance to get people to shift from cash to credit / debit cards.  Read the Visa and Mastercard Q2 transcripts and earnings releases.  The CEO of Visa says that $18T of transactions can go to credit cards because of contactless.  And in the US, there's a coin shortage that forces everyone to use credit cards.  2% of $18T of what were once cash transactions will pay for a ton of contactless cards!  Contactless is king and is here to stay whether or not the pandemic remains.  Oh and the pandemic is still here.  

When issuers buy contactless cards, the average selling prices and gross profit doubles.  The company's business model has a very fixed cost.  If you look at the sales, general &amp; administrative expenses, they were actually DOWN in Q1 2021 even though gross profit went up.  That's how you end up with a 78% increase in EBITDA while revenues only increase by 20%.  Does that mean the end of it?  Nope.  Here's the really fun part.

CPI's business has a mix of large issuers (JPMorgan Chase, BofA, USBancorp, etc - may not be actual customers, but type of customers) and small issuers (fintechs, credit unions, small issuers, etc).  If you read the Q4 2020 earnings letter, you'll see a large percentage (I think 70%) of large issuers have moved to contactless.  Small issuers as of Q4 2020 had only moved maybe 10% over to contactless.  It took small issuers 3-4 years to move to EMV from magnetic stripe and if this trend repeats, then the earnings for the company will go up for 3-4 years at a rapid clip as small issuers adopt contactless.  The increase in the earnings haven't stopped yet and have a long tail!  If you read the Q4 2020 letter, you'll see that small issuers made up 66% of the company's revenues - meaning that the business is weighted towards the part of the business that is going to grow as small issuers adopt contactless.  

So, what's the valuation for all I'm writing about - the answer is CHEAP.  Market cap is $200M.  Net debt is about $300M (actually less, but let's keep the math easy).  $500M enterprise value.  Adjusted EBITDA of \~$80M.  EV/Adj EBITDA is about 6.25x.  This again is on a company whose EBITDA grew 78% last quarter.  Prior two quarters also had explosive EBITDA growth of north of 50%.  Basically EBITDA has exploded since the pandemic hit and adoption of contactless increased rapidly.  

Assuming a not outrageous 10x EV/EBITDA, then you get an enterprise value of $800M.  Back out the debt of $300M, then the market cap is $500M.  that's about a 3x return on current earnings power.  This isn't a pie in the sky if XYZ happens, but using CURRENT economic earnings.  

Where the valuation gets more interesting is if the earnings continue growing due to increased  adoption of contactless that's HERE TO STAY.  If EBITDA goes to $100M and EV/EBITDA goes to 15x, then one can get to a $1.5B enterprise value.  Again, back out $200M of debt and market cap is now $1.2B.  With 11.6M shares outstanding, it's possible to get to $100 stock price.  

Don't take my word for it.  It isn't on the come.  Go read the company's Q3 2020 - Q1 2021 earnings letters.  Go read the company's 10Q and 10K.  On page 32 of the 10K dated 2/25/2021, you'll see this beauty "" We are evaluating our ability to return to listing on Nasdaq and intend to ***apply for listing on The Nasdaq Global Market as we are able and eligible to do so***.""  They have already applied to go on the NASDAQ.  Just a matter of time.  

When was the last time you read a stock pitch that said to go read the earnings and run your own numbers?  

To recap:

1. Real business... manufacturing business that makes real revenues and real profits
2. Former CFO of two fortune 500 companies that came out of retirement to turn around the business
3. Fast growing business with long tail from continued adoption of contactless credit cards from their majority small issuer (66% of revenues per Q4 2020 earnings letter) customers.
4. Exposure to the fast growing fintech market (customers include oxygen and other fintechs)
5. Fixed cost business model with explosive earnings growth as revenues continue growing.
6. Cheap valuation due to being on the OTC and being currently ignored by all the fund screens and quantitative traders
7. Cheap valuation (again just adjusting out Q2 2020 pandemic quarter that hurt the business temporarily) of ***6.25x EV/EBITDA*** while revenues and EBITDA exploding.
8. Catalysts of NASDAQ listing, first earnings call since March 2020, potential analyst coverage, mutual buying due to re-listing, quantitative trader buying from stock showing up on screens with re-listing and continued adoption of contactless

stocks," There have been a few posts about Tattooed Chef in the past. However, none seem to fully integrate an entire equity story, which this post will hope to provide.

**Introduction:**

A lot of people have probably heard the Tattooed Chef name at least from when it completed its IPO last year. However, in case you have never heard of it before or don’t fully grasp the growth potential of the company, here is a quick rundown of Tattooed Chef and what they do. They are a food company selling frozen foods products in the freezer isle at major grocery outlets. TTCF’s products are plant based and leverage the secular vegan, vegetarian, and plant-based food trends. While products are sold in the United States, production takes place in Italy. Production costs are much cheaper overseas and allows for higher margins here in the U.S. Additionally, unlike hardly any of its food industry peers with similar market caps, TTCF is vertically integrated, allowing for greater control of product quality and adaptation – in times of rising input prices and inflation, TTCF is consequently less impacted. It's a new age food company clicking on all cylinders and picking up steam competing against companies of yesteryear.

**Revenue Growth:**

To start off, it is important to know how the company is performing. This company completed a IPO last year. However, even before that, the company has been growing extremely quickly.

Here's some of the numbers from 2017 and on.

2017 Revenue ---------------- **$32.5 Million**

2018 Revenue ---------------- **$47.9 Million (+47.4%)**

2019 Revenue----------------- **$84.9 Million (+77.2%)**

2020 Revenue---------------- **$148.5 Million (+74.9%)**

2021 Revenue (Projected) **$239.3 Million (+61.1%)**

2022 Revenue (Projected) **$323.0 Million (+35.0%)**

The growth numbers above are incredibly impressive on their own. If you are unfamiliar with the food industry, seeing any growth that is above 10% YoY is considered extremely high. However, the top line revenues do not tell the whole story. TTCF sells ""Tattooed Chef"" branded products as well as some private label products. What are some of the most valuable assets in the world? Loyal brands. Tattooed Chef realizes this and for the last few years they have been solely focused on its core brand rather than private label deals.

HERE ARE THE GROWTH NUMBERS FOR **ONLY** TTCF LABELED PRODUCTS

FULL YEAR 2019 - **$18.3 Million**

FULL YEAR 2020 - **$84.6 Million (363% Increase!!!)**

2020 3rd Quarter - **$22.6 Million (Year-Over-Year Increase of 288%)**

2020 4th Quarter - **$23.9 Million (Year-Over-Year Increase of 172%)**

2021 1st Quarter - **$36.0 Million (Year-Over-Year Increase of 105%)**

As you can see, branded revenue is what is really important for this company. The CEO himself has publicly stated that private label revenue over time will be 'phased out'. In my opinion, private label products are almost the secondary cherry on the top that aid the top line while TTCF is still establishing relationships with retailers. Invariably, the private label growth story does not matter and should not be factored into the thought process when making a decision to invest or not.

**Earnings &amp; Profitability Potential:**

Most businesses, regardless of the industry, typically lose money hand over fist in their early stages. The fast cash burn usually requires companies in these growth stages to take on debt and issue additional shares. This usually leads to weaker balance sheets and diluted long-term shareholder value. For Tattooed Chef this is not the case. Shareholder dilution is unlikely and debt is unnecessary for the **ALREADY** profitable business. I doubt long term debt will accumulate unless a large acquisition is made.

The hardest part of this analysis is trying to determine future profitability. While profits are growing, it is hard to know what type of net income and EPS numbers this company will be doing in 2026. Revenue is expected to reach $1.0 Billion annually in 2026. Forecasts this far out can sometimes be a far cry from actual results. But, in this case I believe it is an attainable number by 2026. The big question here is... How much of that will turn into profit?

For 2021, management gave guidance, which has been now adjusted upwards, of a gross margin percentage of 20-25%. By 2026, management expects their gross margin to expand to 35%+. Additionally, as I will mention later, the company wants to grow into the snack category, which will also provide major benefits to their margins.

Food businesses generally have lower margins. Once again, trying to forecast net income for a company like this in 2026 is very difficult. I personally believe a 10% assumption is incredibly conservative but its better to be conservative than too optimistic in these types of situations. Margins will be higher for TTCF versus competitors such as Tyson Foods . A Tyson Foods for example, generally turns \~5% into net income. TTCF could make 10% an attainable number in the next five years.

**Management Team:**

CEO Sam Galletti &amp; Creative Director Sarah Galletti

The CEO is basically a veteran in regards to the food industry. He seems pretty credible and hard working. Rather than give my personal take on someone's character and ability to perform, it would probably be best to do your own due diligence on the CEO. But, from what I can tell, he seems to be a good leader/founder of the company. His daughter Sarah literally is ""The Tattooed Chef"" is the face behind the company. She creates, designs, alters, etc. mostly all of TTCF's products.

Valuation

Tattooed Chef currently trades at a market cap of $1.65 Billion. For a growth company at this stage, P/S ratio likely a better metric to use in terms of valuation rather than P/E ratio. Here are the numbers for 2021 and 2022.

**2021 P/S Ratio - 6.89**

**2022 P/S Ratio - 5.11**

This company is trading at 5 times next years revenue. Considering the growth trajectory moving forward, I would consider this to have considerable value. The company also has $185 Million in cash. Considering this very large cash pile (relative to the company's size) it makes the company's market cap a bit more attractive.

**M&amp;A:**

In May of this year, Tattooed Chef announced the acquisition New Mexico Food Distributors, Inc. and Karsten Tortilla Factory. This acquisition was approximately $35 Million. The company still has $185 Million in cash (as of the last earnings report). This leaves lots of room for further expansions and acquisitions.

While only $35 Million was spent, a significant amount of revenue will be generated from this acquisition. ""We will be immediately addressing the $1 billion Frozen Mexican Food category once the transactions close. At full capacity, we believe Foods of New Mexico can contribute up to $200 million annually in revenue in the next two to three years and create significant value for all our stakeholders.""$200 Million in annual revenue for only $35 Million? Sounds like a good deal to me.

**Current Retail Distribution Points:**

TTCF is in many large retailers already. Target, Walmart, Sam's Club, Costco, Whole Foods, etc. However, these are not just situations where TTCF has a few items in one freezer door. Tattooed Chef has been increasing the number of SKUs that they have in each location.

**IN THE LAST QUARTERLY CONFERENCE CALL THE CEO STATED THAT TARGET CLAIMED TATTOOED CHEF WAS THE MOST SUCCESSFUL FROZEN FOOD LAUNCH IN THE HISTORY OF TARGET.** This is obviously huge for the company. Target is already a big deal for this company and this level of confidence from Target is exciting. Additionally, TTCF wasn’t fully rolled out in most Target locations until Q2. So, the Q1 revenue numbers don’t even account for a full Target launch.

If you want to see some of the pictures that have been gathered with all the sell through that has been seen at Target, message me (post won't allow for pics).

**Kroger Announcement:**

Up to this point, TTCF had solely been in retail locations that did not specialize in only selling food – read the names above again (Taret, Walmart, Sam’s Club). However, just this week, Tattooed Chef announced that they will be partnering with Kroger and plan to have 12 SKUs (for now, will increase in the future) in all Kroger locations by September. For those of you that don’t know, Kroger is the 2nd largest grocer in the U.S.

**New Products:**

This company is coming out with new products all of the time. It seems like every month new flavors and styles of food are announced. But you may be asking the question and saying... ""This is just a food company that sells stuff in the freezer isle. What's the big deal?"" Well the company is currently working on expanding past **JUST** the freezer isle. Plant-based tortillas are currently being talked about. Plant-based snacks are also scheduled to come out late 2021/early 2022. A new executive was just hired a few weeks ago who specializes in the snack industry. In the same way boring old PepsiCo was able to expand into dozens of brands and product styles, TTCF would be able to do the same **IF** they continue their success.

**Marketing Strategy:**

Remember the massive growth numbers we talked about for ""Tattooed Chef"" branded products? Well until 2021, the budget for marketing and advertising TTCF products has been **$0.00**. Until this year, **100%** of their growth has been through their own making. **NOT** with a massive marketing budget. Small TV campaigns and mobile ads are being paid for as of the last few months. More importantly, brand ambassadors/influencers will also be sponsoring TTCF as well. Now that advertising will be impacting the company, I expect brand recognition to steadily increase. Some view this

**Balance Sheet:**

Going over everything on a balance sheet would make this (already long) post even longer. But I have two main things on the balance sheet I would like to point out. Cash as of 03/31/2021 is $185 Million. Meanwhile, long term debt $1.9 Million. The company currently has almost no debt and is cash loaded. Considering this is a company which has $1.65 Billion market cap, $185 Million is a considerable amount of cash. So technically, the valuation of the company is over 10% strictly in cold, hard cash. This is very appealing.

**TAM OPPORTUNITY (Total Addressable Market):**

The total addressable market for TTCF is very large. Virtually anyone who eats food (regardless of dietary lifestyle) are potential customers for TTCF. Plant based, vegan, and vegetarian diets are all growing in popularity. Plant based foods had 13% compounded annual growth rate from 2017-2019. These numbers are expected to continue for the next decade.

**Risks:**

Like all businesses, the company does have many risks. The company is in an extremely competitive market. The food industry will always have big money moving products in and out and competition will continue to be ruthless.

The many retailers TTCF has gotten into could give away the hard earned shelf space. This goes hand and hand with competition risks. If Target, Walmart, Costco, etc. finds a better product, TTCF is at risk of losing the valuable real estate of shelf space.

I believe plant based diets are a trend, not a fad. But, if vegetarian/vegan/plant diets die off in popularity, then Tattooed Chef would likely begin to follow suit as well.

Low margins are kind of the norm for food based businesses. Low margins means less room for error. Profits will likely remain constrained to certain levels for the lifespan of the business.

**TLDR: Tattooed Chef is a plant based food company that has been growing exponentially since hitting the public markets. Last quarter, it had the most successful frozen food launch in the entire history of Target. Just this week, TTCF was announced to be expanding into all Kroger locations by September. Additionally, the company has a strong capital position with a large cash balance and minimal debt that is poised for M&amp;A and also organic expansion into new product categories - the management team recently took on a new leader from Pepsico that specialized in snacks. While some may say TTCF received a transitory benefit from COVID, it's recent performance is clear that the company's best days are ahead of it. With recent price depression over the past couple weeks, TTCF is a great security to exit if growth stocks continue to experience weakness.**

stocks,"Living in the UAE, I pay zero taxes on dividends and capital gains.


However, the US applies a 30% witholding tax on dividends from all US stocks and ETFs.


For ETFs, this can be avoided with Ireland domiciled accumulating funds (internal witholding is just 15%, due to tax treaties), or with synthetic-replication (synthetic ETFs outperform physical ones by a factor equal to the dividend witholding), or by rolling a position on a future every month (cost of carry and commissions being way lower than the witholding, and the index not accounting for any tax).

All cool.


Except I hold positions in single stocks and ETFs not tracked by any future or available in Ireland (example: SCHD).


So, here's my question: would it make sense to buy before the ex-dividend date and buy back later? Or does the price drop after the ex-dividend date already usually accounts for the witholding tax (US-based investors should pay less than 30% on dividends, right)?


If it makes sense, then how exactly would that work? Suppose the ex-dividend date is 07/15. Should I sell at market close on 07/14? Or at 07/13? And can I buy back at 07/15? Or 07/16?

been historically long. He predicted the dot com bubble and shorted. He predicted the housing bubble, sure a little early and shorted it as well. This year when he was 
being interviewed about his gamestop bet he put everyone on notice in January that he was shorting Tesla (which was over $850) critizing the company of buying into BTC.
Here we are and BTC is about the same price TSLA purchased their $1.5B in BTC so if the downtrend continues that 'cash' will be locked up for quite some time. He didn't 
make that bet solely because of BTC but more importantly due to what happened over the last few years to TSLA. In my opinion, it's one of the greatest cons; the companys 
inclusion in the S&amp;P500. There's nothing wrong being added to an index if the company is properly valued but to run up a stock 500-1000%+ to an extremely overvalued stock onto everyones retirement fund.
""All those numbers work out to about a 1.6% weighting for the Tesla in the index. Tesla is already the most valuable company ever added. At a weighting of 1.6%, Tesla will also become the largest weighting ever added.""
Go check out the volume chart for Tesla, specifically Dec 18th putting tesla at $700ish a share. You get the pump into that first earnings and we've been in a downtrend ever since. 
Oh yea, did I mention that's when Burry made his bet? Literally near the top. Tesla volume has also been slowly declining so the buying or next uptrend will come from positive news. What positive news is there for Tesla when
other car companies are showing up to the EV party? They're going to eat market share, the space is going to be crowded (great for consumers) and fundamentals just don't make sense.  

The problem I foresee with his bet is that inclusion price level. If you're betting for TSLA to drop below that $700 you're betting against the everything tied to the S&amp;P500 (401k, IRAs etc)
and as we learned in 2020 the Feds have no problem turning on the money printer. Before I talk about that let me sum up my point about Burry. He made a bet against Tesla, not against the entire market. He put his money 
where is mouth is and he nailed it (so far, looking forward to next 13F). That does not mean he's a doomsday bear. Now stop making these claims until he places the doomsday bet and if and when does place that bet, lets discuss!  

Feds and the money printer. I've read a few comments from you guys or gals stating something like ""Just keep kicking the can down the road"" and truth is, that's exactly what happened. You're right. We had a president who 
woke up everyday and judged his performance by comparing it to the stock market. I've heard that he was the biggest fan of Tesla! Believe me! A president so involved in the market was likes the which never seen before, ever. 
Ok, enough with the Trump speech. There is nothing wrong with letting American captialism do is fucking thing! Oh no, the market lost its gains over 3 years. Yes, the 3/4 years Trump was president he was down 2% due to a pandemic.
Boo Fucking Hoo. The dot com bubble wiped 5 years of gains. The 2009 hit wiped 6 years of gain. Yet we take a baby 3 year hit and thats enough for the money printers get turned on? A fire isn't exactly bad for the forest. 
We had a great oppourtunity to let shit companies take a hit and go under. Let people file bankruptcy and reset. That's when you start pumping the money. You pump the money to give people the oppourtunity to make shit happen until it doesn't work 
again. Yet we pumped the money so things can stay the same. So the monopoly board doesn't get flipped. This is frustrating because I witnessed a lot of people make the right play by waiting. I just read a comment on here a few hours ago
someone stating ""I thought it was going down another 10-20%"" and you were right. It was going down until the Presidents ego took a hit. How terrible would it be for Trump to have a negative market 
return during his tenure! The american people were robbed of an oppourtunity and now their cash is further diluted.

But you guys need to pay attention and stop putting down the doomsday talk or people interested in the eventual crash. It's coming. The writing has been on the wall for a while. Go take a peak at Bank of America 10Qs before 2018
when they battling consumer debt but increasing credit limits to make the books look better! That freefall at the end of 2018 was fun and now they don't even mention their worries about consumer debt! It magically vanished!

Follow the advice of Peter Lynch C SPAN Video: [Redacted By Mods] (18min mark is great shit)  

Keep your eyes on the whales:  [Redacted By Mods] notice they're selling ;) or holding large amounts of cash!  

Escalator up, elevator down! When the market does finally take a proper hit without interference you need to have the stomach to handle investing on the dip.
Believe in what you see and make it happen. It's not going to be easy. Unless you're making money on the way down you have to survive the initial shock and gut up whatever you can to make the bets. 

I've seen and been here before. Trim on the way up and take profits. Slowly fade out of companies that are not making money and have debt. Stay away from the current
stock dilutions where companies are offering stock in attempt to payoff their debt that they have been taking over of the last 5+ years. We're all going to have a great oppourtunity. Yes AMC with 5.5B in debt 
selling shares to pay 1/10th of it off. LOL. There are plenty of companies doing this or will need to do this. I originally posted this before market open but our boy Scotty didn't want to approve the links so thanks Scotty for letting people take a 15% hit on AMC by not approving of my warning.

Again, I can't predict when it's going to happen. But these negative comments like ""It's never going to happen."" or ""Doomsday people like Burry have been wrong for 10+ years during this bull run"" are false and misleading. 
It really needs to stop. There is nothing wrong with talking about it or asking questions like ""how do I protect myself"" or ""how can I make money off a crash"" etcetc. I'd like to encourage you all to continue to be interested 
in protecting your investments and asking challenging questions that bulls have trouble comprehending.",Market Crash Discussions In This Sub,1626301886

$AVB: Avalon bay is a real-estate play. They focus on apartment buildings in developing areas, so in economy crash they won’t be having empty commercial buildings, and they will make more money with inflation as rent prices go up. Any debt they have will vanish with inflation. Their dividend is 2.87% with a P/E of 39(high) 

$MCD: McDonald’s is one of the biggest real estate company’s out there, so their property value would only go up in case of inflation. 47% of their stock price comes from operations over seas, so that would protect against the fed, where 44% of share price comes from US operations. Dividend is 2.18% with a P/E of 34

$WBA(Walgreens): Shipping prices are already going through the roof and company’s haven’t even started passing along trucking, container and cargo plane price increases. People will be shopping and buying tooth paste, and other necessities from Walgreens instead of ordering online.

stocks,"**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, July 14, 2021**

Stocks largely gained today in another volatile session, with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ) once again powering to new intraday highs, the third time this week for the SPY. The major indexes continue to be driven higher by continued strength in mega-cap tech stocks. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small caps, continued its streak of underperformance, trading 1.65% lower today at the time of writing. Market participants continue to digest new inflationary data, Q2 earnings season, and Jerome Powell’s testimony before Congress. 

This week, the market is starting to experience signs of volatility, with the SPY opening the session firmly in the green before falling until about the middle of the session before recovering to close the day green. It seems to me that recent reports about inflationary data have injected some uncertainty into the market. The Labor Department’s June Consumer Price Index (CPI), which measures changes in the prices of consumer goods, rose 0.9% in June, accelerating from May’s 0.6%. Year-on-year, the CPI is up 5.4%, exceeding the 4.9% expected by economists and the fastest rate of growth since 2008. Core CPI, which excludes the volatile price energy and food and is therefore considered a more accurate representation of general price inflation, was up 4.5% year-on-year as prices bounced from last year’s pandemic-era lows.

Today, a report by the Labor Department showed that the Producer Price Index (PPI), which measures the average changes in prices received by domestic producers for their output rose 1% in June, accelerating to 7.3% rise year-on-year, while still reflecting base effects. Core PPI rse 5.5%. This is the fastest rate of increase since 2009.

While the CPI and PPI prints are not ideal, the market’s somewhat muted reaction (though there was a little volatility) seems to confirm that market participants are increasingly pricing in higher-than-expected inflationary data and are buying into the Federal Reserve’s argument that current pressures are transitory and due to pandemic-related disruptions. Moreover, it is very important to consider that current inflationary data is calculated on a year-on-year basis, so base effects are very much inflating the current numbers. In other words, inflationary readings are high because they are being measured using numbers from June 2020 when prices across the board collapsed as lockdowns and social distancing policies were implemented across the world. As I have said many times in the past, I am personally not yet worried about current inflationary pressures translating into a prolonged cycle of higher prices, though one always has to acknowledge the risks in the market and be prepared to act. 

In other news, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell gave  his semi-annual monetary policy to Congress, where once again, he basically said the same thing he has been saying for months. Powell said “inflation will likely remain elevated in the coming months before moderating” and that the US economy was “still a ways” off from reaching the threshold of “substantial further progress” that would trigger the Central Bank to roll-back pandemic-era policies. In short, Powell basically said while he expects higher inflation prints in the coming months, pressures are transitory and due to pandemic era disruptions and the Fed’s goal for economic recovery have not been met. [Here is Powell’s complete testimony, but here are two of his most important quotes.](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/testimony/powell20210714a.htm)

**On the labor market:** “Conditions in the labor market have continued to improve, but there is still a long way to go. Labor demand appears to be very strong; job openings are at a record high, hiring is robust, and many workers are leaving their current jobs to search for better ones. Indeed, employers added 1.7 million workers from April through June. However, the unemployment rate remained elevated in June at 5.9 percent, and this figure understates the shortfall in employment, particularly as participation in the labor market has not moved up from the low rates that have prevailed for most of the past year. Job gains should be strong in coming months as public health conditions continue to improve and as some of the other pandemic-related factors currently weighing them down diminish.”

**On inflation:** “Inflation has increased notably and will likely remain elevated in coming months before moderating. Inflation is being temporarily boosted by base effects, as the sharp pandemic-related price declines from last spring drop out of the 12-month calculation. In addition, strong demand in sectors where production bottlenecks or other supply constraints have limited production has led to especially rapid price increases for some goods and services, which should partially reverse as the effects of the bottlenecks unwind. Prices for services that were hard hit by the pandemic have also jumped in recent months as demand for these services has surged with the reopening of the economy”.

**Highlights**

* Big banks continued to underperform today, with investors not impressed despite banks posting very strong earning reports. . JP Morgan, which is often considered a bellwether for the US economy given its sheer size, reported great results, driven in part by the release of $3 billion the bank had set aside to protect against potential losses from default loans during the pandemic, a sign that consumers held up better than the bank expected. JPM recorded revenues of $31.4 billion and profits of $11.948 billion, a staggering improvement from profits of $4.687 billion a year ago. One downside from the earnings report is a sharp reduction in revenues produced from trading, which is not surprising given the insane run by the market in 2020. 
* Airline stocks initially gapped up in the morning after American Airlines (AAL) and Delta Airlines (DAL) offered upbeat outlooks for the second half of 2021, citing increasing consumer demand as the US continues to reopen. However, stocks were unable to hold onto their gains and largely finished negative.
* Twitter (TWTR) announced it was discontinuing its disappearing Fleets feature after failure to win traction with users.
* According to Facebook (FB), the company is pledging $1 billion to support content creators on its platforms through the end of 2022. Content creators will receive a monthly bonus if they hit milestones for earnings Stars, a form of digital tipping that fans can use to pay their favorite creators during live-streamed videos. Instagram's bonus programs will include incentives to use Reels, its copycat TikTok feature that showcases short-form video clips. Creators will earn money based on how their Reels videos perform, the company said.
* Microsoft (MSFT) is betting hybrid work will provide an opening to make its Windows operating system more widespread, launching a new service aimed at getting users of Apple (AAPL) and Android products to use the software. Windows 365, the company said, will be accessible on any device running any operating system that has a web browser, such as Apple Mac computers, iPhones and iPads, or those running Android software made by Alphabet (GOOGL)

stocks,"# Gold miners vs Junior Gold miners

When looking at gold stocks, you usually have two choices. One, you go for the miners that already produce a decent amount of gold or have solid gold reserves meaning that they can produce a lot of gold in the future. Ideally, the company will have a mix of both, a solid production capacity combined with a lot of reserves to back it up. Two, you go for the junior miners which are essentially miners that are still in the exploration and/or development phase. There is no official definition for junior miners so there is a decent amount of analysts who also classify miners not listed on major indexes as junior, essentially miners with a lower market capitalisation. Personally, I go for the first definition, meaning that I classify them as miners who are still exploring or developing. In my opinion, junior miners are harder to analyze and you need more knowledge and experience to be able to pick the good ones. With them, you can easily lose a big chunk of your investment if they focus on exploring and developing the wrong land, but you could also make a lot of money if they hit the mother lode! There is a really good example of junior gold miners in the media and that's Matthew McConnaughey's 2016 movie Gold. It's obviously dramatised, but it you watch it, you'll get a decent idea of what junior gold miners do. It probably comes as no surprise that junior miners are classified as either growth or penny stocks. Also, they typically do not pay dividends as they reinvest their earnings in mining more gold so in my opinion they are much, much riskier than the established miners. I only really buy them through an ETF and for that I use the VanEck Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF or GDXJ. I think that removes some of the risk, but it is still a risky investment so be careful, especially if you are not that familiar with the gold markets.

# What to look for

Lets look at the first gold stocks that I mentioned, the established miners. The big question is how to pick the best gold miners? Typically, the most important metrics here are the production capacity and the efficiency of operations measured by the all-in sustaining costs, followed by the company's gold reserves. Reserves can be several different types and they are categorised by the degree of certainty. Proven and probable have the highest degree of certainty, followed by measured and indicated which have a medium degree, whereas inferred is the lowest degree. Essentially, if a company has a million ounces of probable gold reserves, then that company is likely to produce a million ounces after accounting for dilution, waste and so on, but if that million ounces is inferred, then the final number can be, for example, only 800 thousand ounces. Also, even the best company is not worth buying if it is overpriced so we obviously need to look at the generic valuation metrics as well. And, finally, most gold miners will also mine other types of metals so that should also be considered.

The 3 biggest gold miners in the world in terms of production are Newmont, Barrick Gold and AngloGold Ashanti, but one look at their all-in sustaining cost tells us that there are more efficient gold stocks out there so let's dig a bit further.

# Polyus

Personally, the most appealing gold stock that I have seen so far is Polyus, which is a Russian gold miner company. They have the lowest all-in sustaining costs by a wide margin - $604 in 2020 which is almost $200 less than the next company at $788. That is a massive, massive margin, especially given that Polyus is the 4th biggest gold producer in the world with 2.8 million ounces of gold produced in 2020. They have massive gold reserves, they just received a positive feasibility study on a new 67 million ounces deposit which could produce 2.6 million ounces of gold annually at an all-in sustaining cost of under $400 dollars which is absolutely amazing and means that they can double their production while lowering costs . According to Yahoo Finance, the company has a 5.4% dividend yield which is also extremely attractive and is trading at a PE ratio of 10.7 which is decent. Polyus also has absolutely massive gold reserves with about 61 million oz probable gold reserves. The most obvious drawback of the company is that its operations are 100% Russian and there may be significant political risk there. Also, unfortunately, the company is not trading on any major exchanges, it is only traded over-the-counter which is a shame, but that just means that we need to follow the stock to see whether it will become available to the wider public soon.

# B2Gold

The next gold stock is B2Gold which is a Canadian gold mining company. B2Gold had the second cheapest gold mining operations in 2020 at $788 all-in sustaining costs. This gold miner produced just over 1 million ounces of gold in 2020 and is projecting a tiny decline in 2021 by between 10 and 70 thousand ounces. B2gold has over 6 million ounces of probable reserves and over 20 million ounces in indicated or inferred reserves. The gold miner operates 3 mines in total, one in Mali, the Philippines and Namibia. B2Gold is also developing mines in Burkina Faso and Colombia. B2Gold is one of the cheapest gold stocks right now with a PE ratio of 6.6 although its forward PE is 19.1 and one reason behind this is that B2Gold is expecting its all-in sustaining costs to rise about 13% to something along the lines of $870 to $910 in 2021. On the bright side, the company has a tiny long-term debt of $76 million. At the same time, it has $480 million in cash equivalents on a market cap of $4.3 billion meaning that the company is financially healthy. Its enterprise value is just $4.04 billion and its ratio of enterprise value to revenue is just 2.28. Over the last 12 months, B2Gold has had a free cash flow of $632 million or $0.57 per share. This gives us a strong free cash flow margin of 33.65%. They are paying a decent dividend, too, at about 3.86%. Overall, B2Gold is looking like a great bargain right now in my opinion.

# Kirkland Lake

Next on my list is Kirkland Lake which is another Canadian gold mining company and it has the third cheapest gold mining operations after B2Gold at an all-in sustaining cost per ounce of $800. Unlike B2Gold, Kirkland is expecting to see the same all-in sustaining cost in 2021 which is good to see. In terms of gold production, the company reported a figure of 1.37 million ounces of gold in 2020 and is expecting similar results in 2021. The company operates 3 mines in 2 different countries, Canada and Australia, which means that there is pretty much no geopolitical risk compared to other companies like Polyus and B2Gold. 2020 was a good year for Kirkland as the company managed to return $848 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Their dividend is actually not that high, it is only 1.89%, but it is well covered by their cash flow which means that it is sustainable. One of the best features of Kirkland is that the company has no long-term debt, which is interesting to see in an extremely capital-intensive business like mining. They have about $800 million in cash equivalents on a market cap of $10.5 billion. In terms of valuation, they are currently trading at a PE of 14.4 and a forward PE of 12.9 which is actually quite decent. Their free cash flow margin is 21.1% which is not the greatest when compared to its peers, but it is still good. Overall, Kirkland Lake is another decent gold stock with a reliable dividend and cheap mining operations.

# Newmont, Barrick, AngloGold and Kinross

Finally, let's take a look at the biggest producers. They have higher all-in sustaining costs, but are they actually a bad deal right now? The top five gold producers in 2020 were Newmont with 5.8 million ounces of gold, followed by Barrick Gold at 2nd place with 4.8 million ounces, AngloGold Ashanti at 3rd place with 3 million ounces, Polyus at 4th place with 2.8 million ounces and Kinross Gold at 5th place with 2.4 million ounces. I already talked about Polyus so lets take a look at the other four. In terms of all-in sustaining cost, all four of them hover around $1,050 per ounce of gold mined with the exception of Kinross which is at $987. Newmont has proven and probable gold reserves of 94.2 million ounces which is the biggest in the industry plus 70 million ounces of measured and indicated gold reserves and inferred reserves of 31.6 million ounces. Barrick's total proven and probables reserves are 68 million ounces, their measured and indicated reserves are 166 million ounces and their inferred reserves are 43 million ounces. AngloGold Ashanti has 29.7 million ounces of proven and probable reserves and 124.5 million ounces of measured, indicated and inferred reserves. Finally, Kinross Gold has 30 million ounces of proven and probable reserves, 32.4 million ounces of measured and indicated reserves, and 9 million ounces of inferred reserves. All four companies also produce silver, copper and other copper-related metals like zinc and lead so that is a nice diversification and ensures that these gold stocks will not suffer too much if gold prices drop. To me, Newmont and Barrick Gold stand out as having the best metrics, but are they the best deal? Let's take a look at the PE ratios. I'm not surprised to see that Newmont has the highest PE ratio with 21.8 followed by Barrick Gold with 15.3. AngloGold Ashanti has a PE of only 8 and the PE of Kinross Gold is just 5.9, almost 4 times less than Newmont's! To get a better idea of their valuation, we can also take a look at their price-to-sales ratio. Newmont is again at the top with 4.36, followed by Barrick with 2.93, then Kinross and AngloGold with 1.84. It becomes obvious that Kinross Gold and AngloGold are cheaper than Newmont and Barrick Gold, but is there a reason behind that? If we look at their free cash flow, it becomes obvious that Newmont runs the most efficient business with a free cash flow margin of 31%, followed by Barrick Gold with 25.2%, AngloGold with 24% and finally Kinross Gold with 9.7%. What this tells us is that Kinross is investing the most money into property, plants and equipment and generally growing its business which can be good, but it could also mean that the current business needs improvement. Newmont, AngloGold and Barrick seem to have less of a reason to invest a lot of cash into growing their business given that they already have massive gold reserves and a massive production so they are in a better position in my opinion. We can also see that the companies are returning money to the shareholders through dividends which is a good sign. Newmont again has the highest dividend yield of 2.77%, followed by AngloGold with 2.42%, Kinross Gold with 1.94% and Barrick Gold with 1.68%. It is worrying to see that Kinross Gold is paying a similar dividend to the rest when they have the lowest free cash flow, but one of the reasons why investors buy gold stocks is because of their dividend so perhaps stopping or lowering their dividend will harm their existing shareholders. Finally, let us take a look at their financial health. How much debt do they have? AngloGold is at the top with a 55.7% debt-to equity ratio meaning that they have $55.7 worth of debt for every $100 of equity. They are followed by Kinross Gold with 29.5%, Newmont with 28.4% and finally Barrick Gold with 16.1%. Out of all four, only Barrick can cover all of their short- and long-term debt with their available cash which is a big plus for that specific gold stock. Okay, so, my take on these four gold stocks is the following: Barrick Gold seems to be the most appealing to me right now. It has the strongest finances, a decent free cash flow, it is at a reasonable price, it has an okay dividend. Newmont has the best dividend even though it has the highest valuation which is good to see, but I think that it could be worth waiting to get the company at a better price. Kinross and AngloGold Ashanti look okay as well, but the low free cash flow on Kinross and AngloGold's high debt make me a bit suspicious although their cheap price compensates for that.

# Other gold stocks

Finally, I want to mention a few other gold stocks. A lot of people talk about Equinox as one of the flashier, fast-growing gold companies out there, but I'm personally not convinced. Equinox is showing decent revenue growth, but its all-in sustaining cost is high and is expected to grow even higher next year to between $1,190 and $1,275 per ounce, one of the highest in the industry! It has a very high PE of 32.8 compared to the other gold stocks and its free cash flow margin is only 2.6%, plus the company has a relatively high debt-to-equity ratio at 40%. It's not paying a dividend, which makes sense for a growing company, but what I am trying to say is that I am personally not seeing the bullish case here, at least not right now. Then, we also have Centerra, Karora Resources, Dundee Precious Metals, Torex Gold. All of them look decent, but they are small cap gold stocks that are not traded on the major exchanges so I haven't looked into them that much. These type of stocks tend to have lower liquidity than the rest of the gold stocks that I have covered which means that the price can be much more volatile and in some extreme cases, you can even even end up with shares that nobody wants to buy so be careful if you decide to trade them.

**Oatly accused of overstating revenue and greenwashing by activist short Spruce Point**

· Activist short seller Spruce Point Capital Management has accused Oatly of shady accounting practices and greenwashing.

· The firm alleges that Oatly has overstated both its revenue and margins to investors.

· Oatly made its U.S. public market debut in late May, giving it a market value of $13 billion.

· According to S3 Partners, about 1% of Oatly’s float, or the number of shares available on the market, is being shorted, as of Tuesday.

Activist short seller Spruce Point Capital Management has accused Oatly of shady accounting practices and misleading consumers and investors about its sustainability practices.

The firm, which has taken a short position against the maker of oat milk, called for Oatly’s board to hire an independent forensic accountant to open an investigation into its claims.

The stock, which was down nearly 3% in premarket trading before the news, fell 6%.

Oatly was founded in Sweden in the 1990s but didn’t reach the U.S. until five years ago. Since then, it’s contributed to the surging demand for oat-based milk substitutes, primarily among coffee drinkers, and made its U.S. public market debut about two months ago. The stock is up 4.5% since its initial public offering, giving it a market value of $12.5 billion, as of Tuesday’s close.

However, Spruce Point’s report claims that Oatly misled investors by omitting or manipulating key facts in its prospectus and a June investor presentation and argues that the company will never achieve profitability. The report is expected to be published Wednesday morning.

“We don’t think any of this is in the narrative at the moment,” Spruce Point founder and Chief Investment Officer Ben Axler said in an interview. “We think this is a strong sell, and the stock price could be 70% overvalued.”

Axler has previously taken short positions against other consumer packaged goods companies, like Church &amp; Dwight and Boulder Brands. Short sellers borrow shares and then sell them, betting that the stock will fall. According to S3 Partners, about 1% of Oatly’s float, or the number of shares available on the market, is being shorted, as of Tuesday.

When reached by CNBC, an Oatly spokesperson didn’t have an immediate response to Spruce Point’s allegations.

Accounting allegations

Spruce Point alleges that Oatly has overstated both its revenue and margins to investors.

The short seller’s report points to the company’s recent investor presentation, which showed estimated 2018 U.S. revenue of $12 million. The firm said that both Nielsen and Umgas Magazine, a Swedish publication, reported that Oatly’s net U.S. sales were just $6 million in 2018.

Spruce Point also cited the company’s filings with Companies House, the U.K. agency that stores information on limited companies.

“We observe periods of large divergence in revenue and accounts receivable growth rates at Oatly,” the report said. “This is a classic sign of potential accounting shenanigans and is often cited as a top red flag to predict accounting scandals.”

Additionally, Spruce Point alleges that Oatly is overstating its gross margin. The company does not include outbound shipping and handling costs in its calculations, and fails to disclose that its gross profit presentation is not comparable to that of other food companies. The report alleges that Oatly’s gross margin is actually 6.4% lower when logistics and shipping are factored in.

The firm also claimed to find anomalies about Oatly’s capital expenditures between its cash flow statement and additions to the balance sheet.

Spruce Point argued that the company hasn’t been transparent with investors about key figures involved in its accounting and auditing. For example, Oatly has allegedly run through three auditors in six years, a fact that was not disclosed in its filings to go public.

“From our experience this is highly unusual,” the report said. ”... While auditor rotations can be viewed positively, we believe three auditors in six years is excessive in light of the accounting anomalies we have identified related to sales, gross margins, inventories and capex.”

Oatly’s current auditor is Ernst &amp; Young, according to a recent filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

The report noted that Chief Financial Officer Christian Hanke’s biography on the company’s investor relations website does not make note of his role as the manager of financial reporting for Stratus Technologies from 1999 to 2005. During that time, the company had to restate its financial results for fiscal 2004 and the first quarter of fiscal 2005. Hanke does disclose the job on his LinkedIn page.

Additionally, Oatly appointed Frances Rathke as chair of its audit committee. In her time as chief financial officer, treasurer and chief accounting officer of Green Mountain Coffee Roasters, the SEC investigated the company’s accounting practices, forcing the company to restate its financial results. Rathke’s biography on Oatly’s website does not include her former role as the coffee company’s chief accounting officer. Her LinkedIn page details her time with the company.

Claims of greenwashing

Oatly has also branded itself as a more sustainable option than cow’s milk or other nondairy alternatives to both consumers and investors. But Spruce Point alleges that the company has been giving a misleading impression of its green credentials, which is known as greenwashing, and putting its global expansion ahead of its mission.

Among the examples it cites is the company’s June 2021 presentation to investors, which uses data based on a 2013 study that was updated three years later. The data does not include the impact of the company’s expansion into Asia or the United States.

Spruce Point also alleges that Oatly has cherry picked the data by omitting that its water consumption is higher than that of making cow’s milk. The company’s 2019 sustainability report also showed that its New Jersey plant was using 55% more water for every liter of oat base than its facilities in Sweden and the Netherlands.

For several quarters, the New Jersey facility has been out of compliance with the Environmental Protection Agency, the report said. The EPA’s website does not identify what the violation or violations are.

Moreover, the hedge fund obtained documents through a Freedom of Information Act request to Millville, New Jersey that showed issues with the plant’s wastewater in 2019, but the company has not yet opened a wastewater treatment facility.

“They’ve had very high levels of wastewater as a byproduct, but they’ve known since 2019, and they’re still in the process of dealing with that,” Axler said.

The report also points to Oatly’s transportation as a major source of its environmental impact. According to Spruce Point, the company sources its oats from Western Canada and then ships them to its facility in New Jersey. For its expansion into Asia, Oatly is sourcing its oats from Sweden.",[CNBC] Oatly accused of overstating revenue and greenwashing by activist short Spruce Point,1626269101

Both Alibaba and Tencent are working on new plans separately to loosen up restrictions including introducing Tencent's WeChat Pay to Alibaba's e-commerce marketplaces, Taobao and Tmall, the WSJ report added, citing people familiar with the matter.  
  
Alibaba did not immediately respond to a request for comment while Tencent could not be immediately reached.

&amp;#x200B;

I am a very ignorant person regarding ETF and finance, so I came here to ask you what of these ETFs you would buy and why:

\- Lyxor MSCI World UCITS ETF - Dist \[FR0010315770\]

\- iShares MSCI World SRI UCITS ETF EUR (Acc) \[IE00BYX2JD69\]

\- Amundi MSCI World UCITS ETF EUR (C) \[LU1681043599\]

\- Amundi Index MSCI World SRI UCITS ETF DR (C) \[LU1861134382\]

&amp;#x200B;

As you can see they are all in EUR, because I don't want to put myself in currency exchange risk (is it a right move?).

What I would like to do is to invest an important slice of my liquidity in an highly diversified product, which I recognize it to be the said index (please let me know if there is something better).

I plan to leave that money (which is money I don't actually need or use) there until I need to buy a house or retirement (I am 26).

stocks,"I have been trading since my Birthday in 1994. (late 1994) I have seen so many things happen in my time of trading. The Dot Com Crash of 2000, the financial meltdown due to mortgages in 2008 and the 2 month correction in 2020 caused by Covid 19. Many traders, especially retail, and on Reddit are probably new and came in after May of 2020. Some have come with Meme craze in late January, so it is important to hear the stories from others so that we can try and gather a perspective if what we have done was bad, or were more worse horror stories.

From 1995 until late 1999 the market was absolutely amazing! In 1996-1997 I finally got internet, dial up AOL 4.0! At that time it made trading and investing much easier. Before that time I would write in a daily journal closing and opening prices for 2-3,000 stocks, daily!!!! Computers were 3-5,000 back then for a very good one and I was a kid! The Dial up US robotics 56K modem was $300.

This last paragraph was very important because with the internet and checking www dot com sites we all thought it was revolutionary. My biggest mistake, also humbled me and taught me many valuable lessons. Pre 1997-1998 I was calling my broker over the phone and paying $50 per trade. I was trading mainly blue chip stocks, on the DOW and SP....... As I came alone and did research....I started to do what we all did in 98-2000. Instead of looking at fundamentals, even sales!!! We started buying stocks based on the clicks of the website!! Yes, that is right! Insane, but right! Sites like Etoys where I lost $50,000 would publish daily or weekly clicks. Based on the clicks the stocks would take fire.... 

In the year 2000, the Nasdaq which was about 5,000 stocks as an index dropped 83% off the peak....I lost over 75% of my money... It was very humbling for myself. It taught me many lessons.

You should buy in increments, blocks if you decide to buy the same stock. (I had 1,000 shares of PCLN at 85 and sold at 9 \[loss of 76,000\] PCLN dropped to 1.50.... It is now BKNG and 2,200\] that is another story!

Diversify! I thought I diversified by buying a ton of tech all in similar fields and sectors. It was a complete dot com bust!

Fundamentals! Do not buy a company with no sales!! No earnings! Negative cash flow! They are going to take on new debt or sell you shares to raise cash!

Lastly, no matter who we are, or how great we were, a crash can happen to anyone! From 1995-2000 I was taking unbelievable and insane risks. My gains were absolutely epic, then I lost 75% off the highs from I believe March - May 2000.

Please share or thoughts so we can all engage. Also, so that new traders see this is not so bad at the moment!",What was the biggest mistake you have made or which crash effected you the most? What did we learn from it? Are we a better trader? Thoughts,1626233480

LMP Motors $LMPX 's business model as “Buy, Rent or Subscribe, Sell and Repeat.” This means that we “Buy” pre-owned automobiles primarily through auctions or directly from other automobile dealers, and new automobiles from manufacturers and manufacturer distributors at fleet rates. LMPX Rents or Subscribe” by either renting automobiles to our customers or allowing them to enter into our subscription plan for automobiles in which customers have use of an automobile for a minimum of thirty (30) days. LMPX then sells its inventory, including automobiles previously included in our rental and subscription programs, to customers, and then we hope to “Repeat” the whole process. LMPX has been actively purchasing dealerships that are cash flow positive and EBITDA positive during this semiconductor shortage.

**IPO and Price History:**

LMPX IPO'd in December 2019 at 5$ per share and has steadily increased throughout the past 18 months, reaching a peak of $45 earlier this year. It has since retraced in price and is currently trading at $14.98. This retracement is largely due to investors believing revenue guidance for 2021 was overstated based on December 2020 Q4 revenues of 4M. LMPX has since reported stellar Q1 earnings and drastically increased its guidance and earnings however there has been manipulation on this stock and has been heavily shorted since its June 29th earnings release.

**Earnings Surprise - June 29, 2021**

LMPX reported earnings 2 weeks ago for quarter one and gave us a internal outlook for quarter two

Quarter two ended June 30th so the internal outlook is accurate

**Quarter 1:**

* **Revenue increased $27.7M to $33.0M**
* **Overall Gross Profit increased by $5.5M to $6.0M**
* **Gross Profit Margin increased by 8.9% to 18.2%**
* **Adjusted EBITDA 1 increased by $3.1M to $1.9M or $0.19 per share**
* **Adjusted Net Income was $1.3M or $0.13 per share**
* **Cash increased by $1.3M to $19.4M**
* **Adjusted Shareholder Equity increased by $18.3M to $47.5M**

**Quarter 2: (internal outlook, numbers for 3 months ending Q2)**

* **Revenue - $147.6M (up from 128m estimated in May, Revenue is accelerating)**
* **Overall Gross Profit - $26.7M**
* **Gross Profit Margin - 18.1%**
* **Cash - $25.1M**
* **Adjusted EBITDA -** **$10.3M** **or $1.03 per share**

**Quarter 2 Net Normalized Net Income Calculation:**

EBITDA - 10.30M

Acq cost 2 dealerships - 0.36M

Settlement - 0.14M

Total 10.80M

Interest 3.95% 175m\*3/12 (1.75M)

Amortization (1.20M)

Income tax (N/A loss cfwd) 0

Normalized Net Income 8.85M

**Earnings Per Share Calculation**

Annualized net income: 8.85\*4 = 35.36M

Total Outstanding Shares = 10.04M

Earnings Per Share = 3.52

Price to Earnings = 14.98/3.52 = 4.25

Industry Average P/E = 30.46 (Jan 2021 data, closer to 34 currently)

LMPX trading at a discount of 86%

**LMPX fair value** = $107.36

**Revenue Forecast: (12 months ending June 2022)**

Revenue - 910 Million

EBITDA - $53 million or $5.18 per share

LMPX will be completing its acquisition of two jeep/chrysler/ram dealerships in the third quarter of 2021. Amounting to 19 dealerships and 17 locations.

LMPX is on track to purchase 80-100 more dealerships by end of 2024 at which point they expect their network to have potential revenues in the 5.1 Billion to 6.4 Billion revenue range and EBITDA of 229m or 288m.

**Valuation to Peers: Price to Sales or EBITDA per Market Cap**

**CVNA:**

Market Cap of 44.7B

Sales of 5.5B

P/S: 8.12

P/E: N/A not profitable

Revenue growth YoY: 41%

**VRM:**

P/S: 1.97 (on the lower end as this is guidance, actual revenue only 33m per quarter)

P/E: N/A not profitable

Revenue Growth Rate YoY: 900% ( on expected guidance, has guided down from 375M)

**LMPX:**

Market Cap of 177M

P/S: 0.19 (based on 2022 revenue Guidance)

P/E:4.25

Revenue growth YoY: 2757% (2020 to 2021 growth)

**LMPX** **Fair Value based on 2021 Sales:**

Market Cap: 4.01B

Share price: $400.6

P/S: 4.5

LMPX is extremely undervalued compared to its peers, it has the fastest growing revenues. Only company with increasing margins, and improving EBIDTA and net income. This does not factor their protentional pipeline growth which aims to exceed 5B in revenues by 2024.

**Used Auto Market Growth:**

The used car market is booming, making it a perfect time for resellers. The shortage of new cars as a result of the global chip prices has demand for used cars surging.

Used car prices have jumped 21 percent since April 2020 and 10% of that came directly during April 2021.

This factor alone should drastically increase guidance for 2021 above the 910 forecast. April price jumps and demand surge will be reflected in next quarters earnings. As car prices continue to increase LMPX will start to make more profit on each vehicle while Gross profit % stays the same.

**Key Acquisitions and Business Moves:**

LMPX has been making key acquisitions over the last few months which will help play into the bottom line.

**LMPX Acquisitions:**

Hometown Subaru - May 2021

2 Dodge/Chrysler Dealerships - April 2021

Bachman Bernard Chevy Buick Dealership - April 2021

New Ecommerce Website - March 2021

LTO Holdings Acquisition - February 2021

Atlantic Auto Group Acquisition - February 2021

Landed 660M syndicate credit line for use of Acquisitions - January 2021

LMPX started off the year with a bang and secured 660m of credit to use towards acquisition's. Which has been put to use over the first 5 months, purchasing multiple auto groups and dealerships. Securing backlogs of inventory and entering into new markets throughout the U.S. These acquisitions will be even more profitable with the recent 10% surge in used car prices in April 2021.

**Refinancing / Dividend and Share Buy Back:**

Last week LMPX announced the approval of debt refinancing, aiming to secure additional capital, refinance at a lower rate and pay down current balances at a faster rate.

Why is LMPX refinancing? LMPX is currently operating at a 18m per quarter cash surplus from operations. LMPX expects their cash balance to exceed 50m by ending quarter 4 after factoring current debt obligations:

Q2 Cash Balance : 25.1M

Q4 Cash Balance : 50.0M

Increase : 24.9M

Current Debt : 11.25M

Net cash flow Q3/Q4: 36.15 or running at a 18m surplus each quarter.

This is prior to refinancing their debts to a lower interest rate. With their current run rate and financial strength they will be able to acquire a larger credit/loan facility at a improved rates to make further dealership acquisitions.

**Dividend Announcement:** LMPX announced that it will be issuing a dividend prior to Q4 for 15% of its excess cash balance back to the shareholders. This is an attempt to attract institutional ownership and to show a sign of strength of their financials.

**Expected Dividend:**

15% of 36M = 5.4M

Shares O/S = 10.04M = 52cents a share or 3.4% Dividend

**Share Buy Back:** LMPX will also be doing a share buyback amounting to 25% of the excess cash (36M)

The CEO (SAM) has stated numerous times that this stock is undervalued, at this current time he will be using excess company money to buyback shares at this suppressed share price to combat the market manipulation that is going on with the stock right now. Shares will be bought up over the course of the next 6 months when excess cash arises.

**Shares to be acquired:**

25% of 36M = 9M

Total Shares = 9M/$14.98 = 600k Shares or 6% of total outstanding shares

**Short Activity and Market Manipulation:**

The price action on LMPX is currently being manipulated by a short.

LMPX recorded recorded revenue growth, increasing margins and increased Q2 and annual guidance.

The stock closed down 4% on the day after being up 21% during premarket.

Since then the stock has dropped another 14%.

This is all while the CEO has announced share buy backs, increasing cash positions, debt refinancing and dividends. He has also hired senior management and appointed a CEO.

**Short Volume Ratio:**

Over the last 10 trading days the stock has averaged a 35% short volume ratio, with short volume ratio amounting to up to 46% on some days. The normal short volume ratio for most companies lands in the 10-20% range. Even stocks that are targets of high short interest such as AMC and GME are in the mid 20% range.

The Short controlling the price action shorts shares each morning around 945-1030 if the market is rallying to kill momentum and dumps into any market sell off. Only on occasions when retail does decide to sell do they cover small positions. Since June 30th they have been significantly increasing their short open interest. The short controlling the price is coming from the ADF venue and has not been buying into the ask for more then 10% of its total shares shorted during each session.

**Short Interest:**

As of June 30th the stock has a short interest of 534k, Shorts covered a large portion of their shares prior to the earnings on June 29th. The stock ran from 15$ to 18.93$ prior to earnings on their coverings and covered roughly 120k shares. The subsequently shorted 100k shares over the next couple days to kill momentum and cause the stock to sell off. Since then they have completely controlled the stocks price action running it from the high of 21$ premarket on June 30th to as low as 12.86 on July 8th. Since then we have had multiple positive Earnings releases and yet we are still trading below pre earnings share price. Current short interest is sitting in the 700k-740k range which represents roughly 12% of the tradeable float.

If the short covers its 700k shares currently sold short we can expect a rally of 6-10$. Covering of 150k shares sent this from 15-19$ prior to earnings release. The short will have a impossible time trying to cover shares with the current volume. Institutions have not sold any shares since February and have added shares since. Retail holders with large positions know the protentional this stock has.

**Float:**

LMPX currently has 10.01m shares outstanding of which 4m are owned directly by management/insiders. Making the tradeable float roughly 6m soon to be 5.4m after the share buy back. The lower the float means the quicker the price moves. Institutional holdings is low but I expect it to drastically increase after next earnings report in August where the company will be reporting 150m revenue and EBITDA of 10m+ and Net income in the 8M range.

**Future Catalysts:**

**Dealership Acquisitions:** Sam stated that the large NYC dealership acquisition will be completed prior to end of Q3 (Sept). This dealership will bring in over 270m annually (2020 figures) expecting closer to 320m at current growth rate and market. It will also be bringing in 5m of Net income (2020 figures) expecting closer to 8m with margins increasing across the board and auto prices soaring. Once this acquisition is complete we will be nearing the 1B annual revenue run rate. Sam will also be acquiring other dealerships as opportunities arise.

**Refinancing Announcement:** Once refinancing is secured, LMPX will be operating with a improved bottom line and more flexibility to acquiring new dealerships and increasing their growth. The dividend and share buy back dates will be announced once refinancing has been obtained. I expect management to be actively shopping rates for the next couple of weeks and a announcement locked in before Earnings in August.

**Q2 Earnings:** LMPX is set to report earnings in August, this will be their first profitable quarter (net income). They will be reporting revenue of 148m (348% growth from prior quarter), EBITDA of 10.3M+ and Net income of over 8M. Analysts will start covering this stock and value investors will be attracted to its earnings ratios compared to its peers. I am expecting them to update us on multiple new dealership acquisitions in the pipeline and increase revenue guidance to 1B for next year.

**Summary:**

LMPX absolutely crushed quarter 1 with revenues of 33M tomorrow representing a 725% increase from prior quarter. Guidance for quarter 2 (confirmed as quarter 2 ends tomorrow) increased by 348% to 148M. This will bring back investors who dumped their shares after the CEO was called out for ""overstating guidance"". New investors will be drawn in from the quarter over quarter growth reported on the call. The recent boom in used auto prices and demand will further excel LMPX as a market leader.

If LMPX continues to exceed revenues estimates and obtain 910M+ revenue for 12 months ending Q2 2022 its fair value compared to its peers should be at $400+ a share using price to sales metrics or 107$ using a Price to earnings ratio.

LMPX is currently a cash generating machine and has announced a share buyback and dividend with its excess cash to try and attract new investors and bolster its undervalued share price compared to its peers.

The CEO has been actively releasing press releases over the last week to try and trap the short who is currently controlling the price. There are many catalysts coming before the August earnings report at which point this stock should be trading in the 30s.",LMPX - LMP Automotive - Growth Monster - Cash Flow Positive - Newly Announced Dividend - Share Buy Back Long Term Undervalued Play,1626222437

stocks,"Generally when I see share repurchases, I waste no time and conclude that it is a positive action made by the company.  But after spending some time thinking about it and doing some research, I’m less sure that this is always the case.

Benefits of share repurchases:

* Generally a signal that management thinks the company is undervalued, especially but not exclusively if repurchases are uncommon
* If the company issues stock options as compensation, they can repurchase shares and use that when the employee exercises their options.  
* Repurchases can be used to remove overhanging stock, that is when there is a large portion of stock that has flooded or is about to flood the market, the company can repurchase the outstanding stock to prevent or bring up the share price, or just to scoop up some stock at a lower than usual price.  
* It indirectly offers more choice to the shareholders compared to dividends.  If the number of shares decreases under normal conditions, the shareholder has the option to hold the stock or sell it and pay taxes realizing the capital gain, whereas with dividends, the shareholder has no choice but to accept the dividends and pay taxes on them.
* In times of temporary prosperity, management may be reluctant to increase dividends because it would look unfavorable when they have to decrease them after.  Instead, if they buyback shares this adds similar value but carries with it less expectation to be consistent.  
* This point ties in with the one above.  If a firm compensates shareholders with both repurchases and dividends, then the firm has a cushion of share repurchases that can increase or decrease while dividends stay the same.
* The obvious fact that repurchases increase the value per share and that price per share generally follows.

Drawbacks of share repurchases:

* The company could pay too high a price for shares
* Some shareholders prefer dividends to share repurchases
* The company may repurchase shares even when there are better alternatives for its capital allocation
* Share buybacks can be used to manipulate per-share figures 
* Buybacks could be used just to reduce dilution from massive compensation in the form of stock or options

In my opinion, a divide between consistent dividends and share repurchases is the most attractive option as long as the firm is not disregarding its own obligations and better uses of capital.

stocks,"Full disclosure: I'm an AMD fanboy. I have been AMD fanboy since 2013. My last PC was full AMD build and my current PC is full AMD build. I love AMD. My only regret was not getting into stocks 5 years ago. I would have happily brought AMD when they were 10usd per stock. :P

But I do not own stock in intel nor AMD. At least, not yet. All my funds are tied up else where.

Now, if you haven't been following PC hardware news. AMD has been killing it with their ryzen series. That launched in 2016. Their current gen hardware is better intel by power and price. PC enthusiasts absolutely love the ryzen series. You can clearly see this on tech side of youtube. Top of that, AMD secured partnership with gaming consoles. All good stuff, right?

Meanwhile, before 2016. Intel was considered the KING. They have connections everywhere throughout the technology world. Intel is known for quality. But now with the release of AMD's ryzen series. They're no longer the king with PC enthusiasts. But Intel still has strong connections with other companies. Their business model has raked in A LOT of money. And they're currently sitting on a lot of money.

Intel has less debt than AMD.

What I don't understand is why AMD is sitting at 90usd and intel is sitting at 56usd.(as of today) The price different is staggering considering both companies have done really well because of the pandemic. Many people brought new desktop and laptops to work from home or school. (Myself included)

Now, you might say.

Well, the ryzen series is why there is a huge price difference.

And yeah, that's a fair point. Intel is currently on their back heels, they're currently being forced to cut prices on products just to compete. But even with price cuts, intel has big price margins. So they're still making money even with price reductions. I would value the AMD 10usd higher than Intel just for that reason. Not 40usd difference.

But AMD has GPU too!

Very true. And AMD GPU have been selling extremely well because of the pandemic. But only because of the pandemic. Their competitor, Nvidia. Has dominated the GPU market for decades. And Nvidia's current generation of cards, RTX 30xx series. Is currently the most desired GPU card on the market. Not just by gamers, but also crypto miners. If there wasn't a global chip shortage or scalpers. PC enthusiasts would buy Nvidia cards right now. (myself included.)

Now, does that still jusify AMD's current price? I don't think so. According to steam hardware surveys.

https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/

Intel has 70% of CPU market place. There appears to be a slight tread downwards in market share. But intel is still owns 70% after 5 years of AMD's Ryzen series reigning supreme.

Top of that, AMD only owns 15% of the GPU market. While Nvidia almost 80% of the market. And crazy enough, intel own 8% of market! That's half of what AMD's market.

So why is AMD at 90usd? While intel sits at 56usd. I believe AMD's current price was driven by an influx of new traders in 2020.

I honestly believe AMD is overpriced and not worth 90usd. I don't have any target prices for intel or AMD. I'm not that smart. But my gut would say, Both companies should be closer in value. Both companies should be around the 50-70usd mark.

My reasoning is, intel still has a lot of potential to come back. They dominated the CPU market for a reason. The only reason why they let AMD take off, they got lazy. They didn't try to make better products. They just made slight improvements and kept their high pricing. Only focusing on generating more revenue than innovations. They currently had a change in leadership and their current CEO is an engineer. In the 1980's, he helped designed the architecture for the Intel 80486 processor. So he clearly has knowledge in intel's products.

While in contrast, when AMD switched their CEO to Lisa Su (who is also an IT engineer) in 2014. We saw the birth of AMD's ryzen series, two years later.

So it is safe to assume, that Intel will make a come back with their CPUs in the coming years with new leadership.",Can someone justify the current price of AMD in comparison to intel?,1626213606

Today was quite action-packed, with both the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) once again recording a fresh intraday high for the second time this week before turning lower towards the end of the session. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, performed the worst, falling 1.75% at the time of writing. Market participants are digesting the beginning of Q2 earning season and a new report that showed in June, consumer prices have surged by the most since 2008.

The Labor Department’s June Consumer Price Index (CPI), which measures changes in the prices of consumer goods, rose 0.9% in June, accelerating from May’s 0.6%. Year-on-year, the CPI is up 5.4%, exceeding the 4.9% expected by economists and the fastest rate of growth since 2008. Core CPI, which excludes the volatile price energy and food and is therefore considered a more accurate representation of general price inflation, was up 4.5% year-on-year as prices bounced from last year’s pandemic-era lows.

While the CPI print is not ideal, the market’s somewhat muted reaction (though there was a little volatility) seems to confirm that market participants are increasingly pricing in higher-than-expected inflationary data and are buying into the Federal Reserve’s argument that current pressures are transitory and due to pandemic-related disruptions. Moreover, it is very important to consider that current inflationary data is calculated on a year-on-year basis, so base effects are very much inflating the current numbers. In other words, inflationary readings are high because they are being measured using numbers from June 2020 when prices across the board collapsed as lockdowns and social distancing policies were implemented across the world. As I have said many times in the past, I am personally not yet worried about current inflationary pressures translating into a prolonged cycle of higher prices, though one always has to acknowledge the risks in the market and be prepared to act. 

In other news, Q2 earnings seasons kicked off today, with two of the largest banks in the US, JP Morgan Chase (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS) both reporting today, as well as Pepsi (PEP). JP Morgan, which is often considered a bellwether for the US economy given its sheer size, reported great results, driven in part by the release of $3 billion the bank had set aside to protect against potential losses from default loans during the pandemic, a sign that consumers held up better than the bank expected. JPM recorded revenues of $31.4 billion and profits of $11.948 billion, a staggering improvement from profits of $4.687 billion a year ago. One downside from the earnings report is a sharp reduction in revenues produced from trading, which is not surprising given the insane run by the market in 2020. 

This quarter, earnings for companies in the SPY are expected to grow by 64% year-on-year, according to FactSet, which would mark the fastest rate of earnings growth since the fourth quarter of 2009, when the US was emerging from the 11.948 housing-bubble induced recession. 

A big part of the strong Q2 earnings growth is easy comparisons to Q2 2020, a period that represented the bottom of the Covid-19 earnings impact. But Q2 2021 estimates also reflect genuine growth, with total index earnings expected to be up +8.8% compared to the pre-Covid 2019 Q2 period. In other words, even when compared to an earnings season 2 years ago, well before the coronavirus pandemic, this earnings season is expected to show very strong growth. Estimates for Q2 and beyond have been steadily going up, with the current +60.5% earnings growth rate up from +50.6% at the end of March and +41.6% at the start of January 2021.

Goldman Sachs strategist David Kosting said that market participants should focus on three questions heading into this earnings season: (1) How will companies deal with rising material costs and supply chain disruptions? (2) How are companies planning to prioritize cash spending? (3) How will companies deal with policy uncertainties, especially surrounding a potential tax hike?

In addition to earnings season, market participants are also looking forward to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell giving his semi-annual Monetary Policy Report to Congress Wednesday and Thursday of this week. Analysts are expecting Powell to once again strike a dovish tone (meaning unlikely to take aggressive action against inflation and instead favor employment), given the mixed June Job Report, which saw a better than expected number of jobs added to the economy but the unemployment rate tick higher and last week’s meeting minutes which showed an increasing divide between members regarding the timeline to begin tapering quantitative easing. In my view, Powell is trying to do three things in the upcoming meeting: (1) reiterate his view that the recovery of the economy is not yet complete, (2) inflation is a result of pandemic-era disruptions, and (3) prevent a repeat of the 2013 Taper Tantrum, a unwarranted, silly, collective market-panic that triggered a spike in U.S. Treasury yields after investors learned that the Federal Reserve was slowly putting the brakes on its quantitative easing program passed during the height of the 2008-09 recession. Moving ahead, further economic reports on consumer price inflation and retail sales out this week are expected to once again underscore that the pace of economic recovery in the US remains limited by supply chain disruptions and labor market imbalances.

* Shares of Disney (DIS) outperformed the market again today thanks to the great success of Marvel’s “Black Widow”, which generated $80 billion in theater sales and $60 billion in streaming sales, the best domestic opening for a movie since the pandemic began. 
* Tesla (TSLA) Chief Executive Elon Musk defended the electric-vehicle maker's purchase of SolarCity Corp. in court, telling a Delaware judge that he didn't act improperly during the negotiating process. This comes in response to a lawsuit filed by TSLA shareholders that allege Musk forced the company to buy SolarCity, a solar-cell manufacturer, in order to save his investment in the company.
* Netflix and Universal have reached a licensing deal that will see more Universal movies, including animated pictures from DreamWorks, available on its streaming platform. 
* Despite successfully completing the company's first trip with Richard Branson as a passenger, shares of Virgin Galactic (SPCE) remain under pressure after the company announced it planned to take advantage of the elevated stock price by selling $500 million in stock, with the stock down roughly 25% from Friday’s prices. 
* Broadcom (AVGO) is reportedly in talks to buy the SAS Institute, a software company with upwards of $3 billion a year in revenue in a deal valued between $15-$20 billion. This is yet another acquisition by one of the world’s largest semiconductor companies.
* Microsoft (MSFT) announced it was acquiring cybersecurity firm RiskIQ to help reduce risk amid “the increasing sophistication and frequency of cyberattacks”.
* SolarWinds says that unknown hackers exploited a previously unknown flaw in two of its programs to go after ""a limited, targeted set of customers."" The company went on to say the hack was “completely unrelated” to last year’s attack” and that the company was still “unaware of the identity of the potentially affected customers”. Seems like hackers find it easy to attack this company.

# INTRODUCTION

Here is a quick run down of Tattooed Chef and what they do. They are a food company selling frozen foods products in the freezer isle at major grocery outlets. Products are plant based to take advantage of vegan, vegetarian, and plant based food trends. While products are sold in the United States, production takes place in Italy. Production costs are much cheaper overseas and allows for higher margins here in the U.S. TTCF is vertically integrated allowing for greater control of product quality and adaptation. It's a new age food company clicking on all cylinders and picking up steam competing against companies of yesteryear.

# Revenue Growth For TTCF

This company is growing like a BEAST. Here's some of the numbers from 2017 and on.

2017 Revenue ---------------- **$32.5 Million**

2018 Revenue ---------------- **$47.9 Million (+47.4%)**

2019 Revenue----------------- **$84.9 Million (+77.2%)**

2020 Revenue----------------  **$148.5 Million (+74.9%)**

2021 Revenue (Projected) **$239.3 Million (+61.1%)**

2022 Revenue (Projected) **$323.0 Million (+35.0%)**

# The Growth Number EVERYONE Is Ignoring

The growth numbers up top seem impressive right? Well this is a case where just top line revenues do not tell the whole story. TTCF sells ""Tattooed Chef"" branded products as well as some private label products. What are some of the most valuable assets in the world? Loyal brands. Tattooed Chef realizes this and for the last few years they have been solely focused on its core brand rather than private label deals. Why does Coca Cola dominate the drink space for decades? Because the brand is globally recognized and it's a product people trust. Is TTCF there yet? No. Will it ever get there? Maybe. But so far they are on the right track to do so.

&amp;#x200B;

HERE ARE THE GROWTH NUMBERS FOR **ONLY** TTCF LABELED PRODUCTS

&amp;#x200B;

FULL YEAR 2019 - **$18.3 Million**

FULL YEAR 2020 - **$84.6 Million (363% Increase!!!)**

&amp;#x200B;

2020 3rd Quarter - **$22.6 Million (Year-Over-Year Increase of 288%)**

2020 4th Quarter - **$23.9 Million (Year-Over-Year Increase of 172%)**

2021 1st Quarter - **$36.0 Million (Year-Over-Year Increase of 105%)**

&amp;#x200B;

As you can see, branded revenue is what is really important for this company. The CEO himself has publicly stated that private label revenue over time will be 'phased out'. In my opinion, private label revenue is mostly irrelevant with this growth story. While 50%, 60%, and 70% revenue growth may be impressive, the numbers that really matter, (branded products) are growing well over 100% year-over-year.

# Earnings &amp; Profitability Potential

The CEO and founder of the company (see information below) has had a long history of running food businesses. Before running public companies, the businesses were ran to feed his family and live a prosperous life. So, Tattooed Chef is ran with the intention of being profitable **AND** growing rapidly. For a company in its early growth stages, this is very rare. Most businesses, regardless of the industry, typically lose money hand over fist. The fast cash burn usually requires companies in these early growth stages to take on debt and issue additional shares. This usually leads to weaker balance sheets and diluted long-term shareholder value. For Tattooed Chef this is not the case. Shareholder dilution is unlikely and debt is unnecessary for the **ALREADY** profitable business. I doubt long term debt will accumulate unless a large acquisition is made.

So far, TTCF has produced minimal profits. This is mainly due to them reinvesting virtually all profits back into the business for further growth. The chart is more accurate for results from late 2019 and early 2020. The chart is unfortunately skewed heavily in the last few quarters due to a large tax benefit (changing from S corporation to C corporation) and other things such as the recent acquisition. (More on that later. But, as you can see, the company can make money **AND** grow revenue for their flagship ""Tattooed Chef"" branded products &gt;100%.

The hardest part of this analysis is trying to determine future profitability. While profits are growing, it is hard to know what type of net income and EPS numbers this company will be doing in 2026. In the chart below, revenue is expected to reach $1.0 Billion annually in 2026. Forecasts this far out can sometimes be a far cry from actual results. But, in this case I believe it is an attainable number by 2026. The big question here is... How much of that will turn into profit?

Food businesses generally have lower margins. Once again, trying to forecast net income for a company like this in 2026 is very difficult. But, we will use an assumption of 10% of revenue turning into net income in 2026. Margins will be higher for TTCF versus competitors such as Tyson Foods (See Below). A Tyson Foods for example, generally turns \~5% into net income. TTCF could make 10% an attainable number in the next five years.

So assuming 10% into net income out of $1.0 Billion in revenue, that means net income would be an assumed $100 Million in 2026. Here are valuation/stock price estimates based on those profitability estimates. The stock currently currently trades at almost exactly $20.00 as of the time of writing at 07/10/2021

**Lower End - 2026 PE Ratio of 20 - Market Cap of $2.0 Billion - Stock Price of \~$24.40**

**The Middle - 2026 PE Ratio of 25 - Market Cap of $2.5 Billion - Stock Price of \~$30.51**

**Higher End - 2026 PE Ratio of 30 - Market Cap of $3.0 Billion - Stock Price of \~$36.61**

# CEO Sam Galletti &amp; Creative Director Sarah Galletti

The CEO is basically a veteran in regards to the food industry. He seems pretty credible and hard working. Rather than give my personal take on someone's character and ability to perform, it would probably be best to do your own due diligence on the CEO. But, from what I can tell, he seems to be a good leader/founder of the company. His daughter Sarah his literally is ""The Tattooed Chef"" is the face behind the company. She creates, designs, alters, etc. mostly all of TTCF's products. Here is their website posting information about the two.

# VALUATION

Tattooed Chef currently trades at a market cap of $1.65 Billion. For a growth company at this stage, P/S ratio likely a better metric to use in terms of valuation rather than P/E ratio. Here are the numbers for 2021 and 2022.

**2021 P/S Ratio - 6.89**

**2022 P/S Ratio - 5.11**

This company is trading at 5 times next years revenue. Considering the growth trajectory moving forward, I would consider this to have considerable value. The company also has $185 Million in cash. Considering this very large cash pile (relative to the company's size) it makes the company's market cap a bit more attractive.

# MERGERS &amp; ACQUISITIONS

In May of this year, Tattooed Chef announced the acquisition New Mexico Food Distributors, Inc. and Karsten Tortilla Factory. This acquisition was approximately $35 Million. The company still has $185 Million in cash (as of the last earnings report). This leaves lots of room for further expansions and acquisitions.

While only $35 Million was spent, a significant amount of revenue will be generated from this acquisition. ""We will be immediately addressing the $1 billion Frozen Mexican Food category once the transactions close. At full capacity, we believe Foods of New Mexico can contribute up to $200 million annually in revenue in the next two to three years and create significant value for all our stakeholders.""

$200 Million in annual revenue for only $35 Million? Sounds like a good deal to me.

# NEW DEAL WITH WHOLE FOODS

TTCF is in many large retailers already. Target, Walmart, Sam's Club, Costco, Whole Foods, etc. Many other big names are currently in the work as well. Whole Foods is there most recent big announcement in May of this year with two products being offered. The two products being offered are listed below.

# LEAKED INFORMATION ABOUT TTCF IN KROGER

Kroger is the 2nd largest grocer in the U.S. and a deal with Kroger could be MASSIVE for this company. Has a deal been announced yet? Nope. But I have some good news. I am in a discord chat full of other TTCF shareholders. It appears that (while it has not been publicly announced by Tattooed Chef) a soft launch of their products are being sold at a few Kroger locations. Photos and prices can be found listed online in certain areas of Kroger's website. Two different shareholders I have personally spoken to have been able to buy TTCF at Kroger locations. This would obviously be HUGE for TTCF if they are able to get this deal. While it may be unconfirmed for now, it seems to me that very soon a deal is inevitable. Here are some photos I was able to grab off of the Kroger website.

# UPDATED INFO FROM THIS MORNING

TTCF is not **OFFICIALLY** in Kroger. Two days ago when I posted this original post, it was all rumor and speculation. They will be fully launched two months from now in September. They will be in 1,800 Kroger locations with **12 DIFFERENT PRODUCTS!** This is huge news and the official press release is shown below.

# NEW PRODUCTS

This company is coming out with new products all of the time. It seems like every month new flavors and styles of food are announced. But you may be asking the question and saying... ""This is just a food company that sells stuff in the freezer isle. What's the big deal?"" Well the company is currently working on expanding past **JUST** the freezer isle. Plant-based tortillas are currently being talked about. Plant-based snacks are also scheduled to come out late 2021/early 2022. A new executive was just hired a few weeks ago who specializes in the snack industry. In the same way boring old PepsiCo was able to expand into dozens of brands and product styles, TTCF would be able to do the same **IF** they continue their success.

# MARKETING EXSPENSES/MARKETING STRATEGIES

Remember the massive growth numbers we talked about for ""Tattooed Chef"" branded products? Well until 2021, the budget for marketing and advertising TTCF products has been **$0.00**. Until this year, **100%** of their growth has been through their own making. **NOT** with a massive marketing budget. Small TV campaigns and mobile ads are being paid for as of the last few months. More importantly, brand ambassadors/influencers will also be sponsoring TTCF as well. Now that advertising will be impacting the company, I expect brand recognition to steadily increase.

# TARGET LAUNCH

**IN THE LAST QUARTERLY CONFERENCE CALL THE CEO STATED THAT TARGET CLAIMED TATTOOED CHEF WAS THE MOST SUCCESSFUL FROZEN FOOD LAUNCH IN THE HISTORY OF TARGET.** This is obviously huge for the company. Target is already a big deal for this company and this level of confidence from Target is exciting.

# BALANCE SHEET

Going over everything on a balance sheet would make this (already long) post even longer. But I have two main things on the balance sheet I would like to point out. Cash as of 03/31/2021 is $185 Million. Meanwhile, long term debt $1.9 Million. The company currently has almost no debt and is cash loaded. Considering this is a company which has $1.65 Billion market cap, $185 Million is a considerable amount of cash. So technically, the valuation of the company is over 10% strictly in cold, hard cash. This is very appealing.

# TAM OPPORTUNITY (Total Addressable Market)

The total addressable market for TTCF is very large. Virtually anyone who eats food (regardless of dietary lifestyle) are potential customers for TTCF. Plant based, vegan, and vegetarian diets are all growing in popularity (See Below). Plant based foods of had 13% compounded annual growth rate from 2017-2019. These numbers are expected to continue for the next decade.

# POTENTIAL RISKS FOR TTCF

Like all businesses, the company does have many risks. The company is in an extremely competitive market. The food industry will always have big money moving products in and out and competition will continue to be ruthless.

The many retailers TTCF has gotten into could give away the hard earned shelf space. This goes hand and hand with competition risks. If Target, Walmart, Costco, etc. finds a better product, TTCF is at risk of losing the valuable real estate of shelf space.

Sam and Sarah are the backbone of the company. The bulk of shares are owned by them and they are what makes the company the success that it is. If for whatever reason, they were to part ways with the company, it is questionable how successful this business would be.

I believe plant based diets are a trend, not a fad. But, if vegetarian/vegan/plant diets die off in popularity, then Tattooed Chef would likely begin to follow suit as well.

Low margins are kind of the norm for food based businesses. Low margins means less room for error. Profits will likely remain constrained to certain levels for the lifespan of the business.

Inflation has been a big talk in the markets recently and rising costs of raw materials for their products could rise. This could potentially hurt profitability.

Risk free rate of return drives valuation for all equity securities. The risk free rate of return is currently at rock bottom. If this were to change, then stocks with profits that are future oriented would likely see their valuation contract. TTCF falls into this category of valuation contraction.

stocks,"TLDR: Most exploration companies are terrible.

This post reflects what I have found after looking at dozens of medium and smaller sized canadian and american exploration companies.  There are a few that look promising - they have some revenue coming in, some attractive operations, maybe even some earnings.  But more often than not, I come across some of these common attributes:

* There is no revenue, and a lot of losses
* They issue more stock each year to offset retained losses and keep liabilities low  
* They have optimistic content on their website, press releases, and anything excluding their finances.
* They may have a lot of assets relative to liabilities - mostly with assets acquired or cash generated as a direct result of huge share issuances.
* They have many years of unprofitable operations, and a history of rebranding.
* They sometimes own or claim land that has some legal, political, regulatory, locational,  or other type of problem.

I have heard that many of these companies are mentioned in social media, and I have seen them recommended in articles, as well as all over reddit.  

Take for example standard lithium ltd (TSXV:SLL).  They have no operations.  Zero.  They have been around for 23 years and still don’t have any actual operations.  If you look at their balance sheet two things pop out at you. They have a lot of assets relative to liability, and they have two massive numbers under equity.  Their share capital is massive, and rising and their deficit (accumulated) is also massive and only increasing.  The income statement solidifies that they are issuing shares - an increase of about 12% in the past year.  Their recent press releases are optimistic, and they make it seem like they have operations by showing processing plants they have, but some deeper research shows that they are destroying a lot of shareholder value every year.

Another case is los andes copper ltd (LA).  They are currently in a legal battle with a community in Chile, and I will let you be the judge of what the legal outcome could be when LA decides to do battle with the Chilean people and their government to get mining permits.  Here is the document provided by the people who live near LA’s claim: [Letter](https://miningwatch.ca/sites/default/files/cartaalpueblodecanadaeningles.pdf?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=b448350a5f76af5368f87ce063d4319cff9b66ee-1626201317-0-AXFv2valzhSwnCpQiSIhbMo2SAIhHoLiZTc9oXNkfwh3OSKKEr13VfPLh6ZsmKsF6Tl6QwAQAgaeynHOom93zUm8xdvtCLXmN21ptH7JkgCTxAXwdG9e89blu_egpn1RCaJX0jhlUt2Y_01755uHiBhj2tOGWd9gO7gKiYzz0vDprZWVbjv04PFyaeghx3e_XbP6dC2CvcKAi7rNCO5bDsSP7tSkfidqbctRedi66KdsopM1QLzo_Y8z0HOwn9uMBskZkHJSglIYtPsbLGoew6WPHAI8RxVelWupCSx_m4fimOy_5n8exl2pxoeKjfpDZrx0h4wzkkDJ1zSg1de7bxZm9CAEF3-s_ncnNM_t9HtwF1CjhvbFCTfS2jrcJdUPFkT1vbJYVQgF1td3YFJXUaJtzDWZqp4rkaB9GL60TjB9I9zScUUv47IK4sZZxRhSaVDNjr9aHewAlH3g3hBWHfk)

And take virginia energy resources, an american company that owns the property above but has consistently been denied the permit to extract the resources.  Their claim has been re-evaluated many times over and gone from tens of millions to under 3M.  Most of their costs over their 14 year existence have been legal, and in that time they have accumulated over 47 Million in accumulated deficit (Mostly from legal fees), issued $50M in equity, and only have a $3M claim.  Who in their right mind spends 16 times what a claim is worth on legal fees to get a permit to extract it?? Certainly not a rational or competent manager.  

There are hundreds of companies like this.  One can only guess at the motives behind someone who promotes one of these companies.  I have decided that when you see someone promoting these companies, they probably fall into these categories:

* Someone who has lost a lot of their investment due to massive dilution and trying to make their money back.
* Someone who is not a long term investor in a company but trying to pump them because they are small.
* Someone who has not done enough research or has been deluded into believing that the company has good prospects.
* Someone who has done very deep analysis and determined that the company may generate some revenue.

As you can see, only the last of these categories has good intentions.  And it is hard to tell the difference between someone with an objectively justified bullish case and someone who is trying to persuade you that the company they are talking about has great potential despite its state of despair.

stocks,"A little portfolio update for the month of June! Ok so my portfolio increased by another -- very solid 4.41% and ended the month at $23,480 dollars! So stoked because that makes back to back months of 4 percent gains!

Basically it was a very strong month for Nvidia as it’s upcoming 4 to 1 dividend split has investors raising price targets across the board, leading to further investment interest and in turn raising the actual price.

And at a 15% gain for the month, I only wish I had purchased a few more shares when the last tech dip occurred. If you remember me saying in one of my recent recap videos, I am still extremely bullish on nvidia in the long term, so while this short term growth is great, I still believe the price point to be a great distance away.

Suppose I sell QQQ at a loss to incur a taxable loss. Then, I buy the equivalent QQQM at the same overall cost basis as my QQQ sale. Is this still considered a wash sale? If not, then it’s pretty much a way to get around a wash sale for specific stocks that have these equivalent tickers?

I suppose there are other tangential examples like selling SPY at a loss to buy VOO. I am inclined to believe that a SPY sell and a VOO buy is not considered a wash sale since they’re two different products from two different companies.

stocks,"Across reddit people love blasting Jim Cramer and there's certainly plenty of fair criticisms to make, but watching Mad Money has been extremely beneficial for me.

It's important to have the right context, so this is how the show is broken down:

* Opening segment: Jim's thoughts on the emerging trends in the market, what happened today, things to keep an eye out for in the coming week(s). This segment is about 10-12 mins.
* Middle segments: Typically there are 2-3 CEO interviews.  If there are only 2 interviews, Jim typically does a ""special topic"" segment where he does a deep dive into a specific stock or industry.  He also does a more technical focused segment where he looks at charts about once a week or so during one of these middle segments.
* Lightning Round: Callers phone in and ask about specific stocks in rapid-fire for about 5 mins.
* Closing segment: Final 5 mins of the show where Jim shares some final thoughts...similar to the opening segment but only about half the time and with different topics.

Okay, so first off, the lightning round segment is completely unhelpful for serious investors. I almost never watch this part of the show.  For some reason people seem to imply the whole show is lightning round type of stuff...it's not.  This segment is to drive interest / entertainment, which has worked pretty well for the show, but pointless for investors to listen to.

The CEO interview segments - I only watch if it's the CEO of a company I may be interested in.  Definitely need to understand that the interview is essentially a sales pitch for the company.  I've gleaned some interesting info from these interviews, but understand I'm only getting part of the story.

For me the most helpful / interesting part of the show are the opening / closing segments and any of the special topic segments in the middle when they occur.  I watch these every day while I'm either making dinner or showering / getting ready for bed (I pull it up on my phone via youtubeTV).  It takes about 15-20 mins total.  

**SKIP TO THIS POINT IF YOU DONT WANT TO READ ANYTHING ELSE:**

The reason I like these segments is because it gives me investing *ideas* I can go and research and do my own due diligence on. While he obviously gets things wrong, more often than not I've been introduced to some really solid analysis and ideas that have led to me making tens of thousands of dollars over the last few years of watching the show / investing.  I've been pushed to look into stocks and industries that I would have otherwise never looked into. It's NOT a good idea to blindly go buy any stock he (or any other analyst) mentions.

The motivation behind this post is to offer another perspective in contrast with the folks that just blast the show / cramer as an know-nothing idiot.  A lot of investors here (particularly newer investors) can really learn a lot from the show and it can push them in the right direction as they look for stocks / industries to research.

**tl;dr** \- The show is a great place to get introduced to investing ideas and stocks that I later do my own due diligence on, especially if you only focus on the most beneficial segments.  It cuts a lot of the leg work and searching, so my efforts are focused on typically good quality stocks (though there have been multiple recommendations from the show that my own research has led me to stay away from the stock). The result is that I've made some excellent stock picks and made great money over the years as a direct result of the things I've learned from the show.  

Last thoughts: One recent example of a huge miss by Cramer is that he strongly recommended buying into the DIDI IPO.  If you've followed any financial news at all in the last week or so, you know the Chinese government cracked down on DIDI and the stock plummeted.  Cramer fully took ownership of this blunder on his show and said he's never going to recommend a Chinese IPO again.  Ironically, I actually avoided this stock because of how skeptical Cramer has been of Chinese stocks historically.  I was very surprised when he recommended DIDI (he said he thought his was one of the few Chinese stocks worth buying), but I decided to stay away because the Chinese government was way too big of an X factor for me.  Glad I went with my gut.  Gotta do your own due diligence and ultimately make your own calls, because it's your money.  The show is a great place for ideas, but you've got to do the rest of the leg work! Because clearly he's not going to be right 100% of the time.",Here's why I like to watch Mad Money [serious],1626197033

Due to precipitous increases in container and dry-bulk shipping spot-rates, it is my belief that SFL will dramatically outperform analyst consensus estimates of $0.19/share earnings in Q2 2021. My model indicates they will achieve $0.27 on a recurring basis, up over 50% when compared to the previous quarter, and a dividend increase is very likely to occur as a result. My price target for SFL is $12/share following its earnings announcement in August.

For more a more detailed analysis on what is driving this growth, check out my recent submission history for the Q1 report.

##**Summary of Estimates**

Total charter hire of $145M in Q2 vs $135M in Q1.

Recurring earnings of $30.9M (~$0.27) in Q2 vs $20.4M (~$0.18/share) in Q1.

Non-cash/non-recurring earnings of $5.0M in Q2 vs $11.1M in Q1.

Total combined earnings of $35.9M (~$0.31/share) in Q2 vs $31.5M (~$0.27/share) in Q1.

**Liners**

Q2 estimated hire of $76.3M vs $74.4M in Q1
Inclusive of $2.3M estimated Q2 profit share vs $2.4M in Q1

Increase attributable to higher rates for 2 container feeders and 2 car carriers trading in the spot market. Decreased profit share due to declining scrubber fuel spread.

**Bulkers**

Q2 estimated hire $41.6M of vs $31.9M in Q1
45% of charter hire coming from ships operating in the spot markets.

Increase attributable to 7 handysize bulkers and 3 supramax bulkers trading in the spot market, and 8 capesize bulkers on time charters with profit share.

**Tankers**

Q2 estimated hire of $15.2M vs $15.3M in Q1
Inclusive of $0.3M estimated profit share in both quarters

Decrease attributable to slightly lower rates for 2 Suezmax tankers and declining scrubber fuel spread.

**Rigs**

Q2 estimated hire of $12.2M vs $13.2M in Q1

Decrease attributable to forbearance agreement that captures only ~75% of charter hire. Agreement was signed midway through Q1 and $12.2M/quarter is expected until Seadrill concludes its restructuring. Note that $4.1M/quarter is accruing in escrow and will be released following the Seadrill restructuring.

##**NonRecurring/NonCash Items**

**Securities**

We estimate a gain of $2.6MM on marketable securities due in Q2. This is entirely driven by appreciation of 1.4M shares held in Frontline. SFL may have sold these shares during Q2, but a likelier scenario is that the forward purchasing agreement was extended, as the shares are being borrowed against.

SFL’s other bonds and securities are likely to have appreciated as they are oil-related, but are also highly illiquid and difficult to value.

**Swaps &amp; Derivatives**

It is difficult to find accurate pricing history on all of the swaps and forward exchange contracts that SFL holds. With that said, I estimate an approximate $2-3MM appreciation on swaps and derivative contracts. Note that any gains on swaps or forwards are non-cash and will be offset by increased debt payments over the duration of the contract. Valuation of forwards is expected to increase based on announcement of aggressive rate hikes by Norges bank beginning in September, offset partially by a more aggressive timetable for rate hikes by the US Federal Reserve and appreciation of the dollar relative to the Norwegian Kroner.

**Other items**

Gain on repurchase of debt and a small reduction in the credit-loss provision is likely, but not estimated.

The lion's share of the company's revenue comes the united states government. Most of all aircraft used by the USAF comes from this one company.

Lockheed recently announced 2020 a new CEO in 2020 to run the company. His name is Jim Taiclet. While having several years of experience with Lockheed, his previous experience as CEO was not with another defense company.

Most of his career was spent running the successful REIT known as American Tower (AMT). The company has been very successful both during and after his tenure.

2019 - $2.40

2018 - $2.20

2017 - $2.00

2016 - $1.82

Dividend Yield = 2.68%

Payout Ratio = \~40% (Very Safe)

Let me start be saying that this company is EXTREMELY profitable. The company is currently on an 18 year consecutive dividend streak. Not to mention the company buys back BILLIONS of its own stock year in and year out, with the share count having decreased by 50% since 2009. I fully expect this company to be a dividend aristocrat in a few years.

The dividend yield is about double that of the S&amp;P as of today and only has a Payout Ratio of about 40%. This means that not only does this company have a good yield while buying back stock, but this company can EASILY afford to maintain and RAISE the dividend over time dramatically.

LMT is expected to grow top-line revenue numbers 4.50% in 2021 and 3.70% in 2022. Earnings per share for the company in 2020 finished at $24.58. This is expected to grow to $26.68 in 2021 and $27.90 in 2022.

Contracts are usually signed many years in advance. Revenues can be easily forecasted for the next several years due to the timelines of the contracts. Furthermore, innovation is not only encouraged, but expected by shareholders AND the united states military is order for our nation to maintain relevant in terms of weaponry.

New age military equipment is usually pretty ""hush-hush"" on what is in the works but Lockheed Martin does disclose some of these new products including technologies such as new highly intelligent drones, missile systems, and even targeted lasers.

One thing is for sure, the military will continue come out with bigger and more powerful weapons as time goes on. Who will likely be selling it to them? Probably good ole LMT.

Newer acquisitions such as the recent AJRD deal allows Lockheed to also focus on other products in the space category and is another wildcard with some potential.

**COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE/ BARRIER TO ENTRY**

The regulations are incredibly strict. The demand for capital is VERY HIGH with projects frequently running into the billions of dollars. Switching from one business to another poses risks for the government and our military and are usually avoided.

This makes the U.S. government very loyal and sticky to LMT business and this is very likely to continue. While there are competitors in the space....Lockheed continues to dominate this market.

**VALUATION (WHY IT'S A GREAT BUY IMO)**

As mentioned earlier, the company is expected to produce $27.90 in EPS in 2022. Based of of today's price of $390, this gives this company a forward PE ratio of \~13.9. This is an *EXTREMELY low forward PE* ratio for a company putting up record numbers and dominating the market that it operates in.

This is even more impressive considering it's still off a fair amount from it's previous all time highs. I am very bullish and this is one of my largest positions. I am not remotely interested in selling. I am buying at these prices or really anything even close to these levels. I wouldn't sell a share if this company were to go to $800 a share tomorrow morning.

[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/LMT/analysis?p=LMT](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/LMT/analysis?p=LMT)

**RISK FACTORS TO CONSIDER**

Almost all revenue comes from one customer (the government). It is steady and consistent but if the government were to fall out of love with Lockheed then this company would be negatively impacted.

There aren't many who could take down LMTs throne but their main competitor is Boeing. Boeing has the capital and leverage to compete with Lockheed Martin long term.

This company is susceptible to a number of different geopolitical risks. Conflicts with other countries could be both a Negative AND a positive for Lockheed.

stocks,"I’m a but confused on a couple topics, so I’m hoping you all can provide some clarification.

1) I make enough to put in $500/bi-weekly. People always seem to suggest putting some towards a safer bet like SPY. However, let’s say SPY costs $450. I can only buy one stock. If, in 10 years it hit $900, that’s only a $450 profit. Are these costly stocks more just for people with lots of extra money?

2) People say penny stocks are risky. But if I put $500 in a penny stock, let’s say a $1 stock, and put a stop order on it at $2, isn’t that a lot more likely to happen within 10 years than $900 on a stock like SPY?

stocks,"JPMorgan Chase (JPM) kicked off the second quarter earnings season for bulge-bracket backs on Tuesday, reporting better-than-expected earnings results that were bolstered by a strong economy and the release of credit reserves. 

Here are the key figures versus estimates, according to Bloomberg:

Adjusted earnings per share (EPS): $3.78 vs. $3.13 estimate

Excluding credit reserve releases: $3.03 per share

Revenue: $31.4 billion vs. $30.07 billion estimate

CEO Jamie Dimon said the development reflected the underlying strength of the economy, and the health of consumers.

He noted that the consumer balance sheet ""remains exceptionally strong,"" while the economic outlook ""continues to improve."" The CEO pointed out that net charge-offs were down 53%, which ""were better than expected, reflecting the increasingly healthy condition of our customers and clients.” Dimon added that debit and credit card spending was up 45% from a year ago, and up 22% from the second quarter of 2019 pre-pandemic levels. 

Breaking the results down further, total markets revenue declined 30% to $6.8 billion in the quarter, with fixed income revenue falling 44%, but were offset by equity markets revenue climbing 13%. In recent weeks, Dimon suggested a ""more normal"" quarter for trading with revenue from trading fixed income and equities ""a little bit north of $6 billion.""","JP Morgan earnings soar amid 'exceptionally strong' consume balance sheets, credit releases.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

About: CTS is currently a Canadian based I.T solutions company. They serve the mid market customers compared to Constellation and CGI who serve the larger enterprise customers.



Why it’s undervalued: Compared to its main competitor CGI which trades to a p/s of 2.31, CTS trades at a p/s of 1.89. Here’s the catch, CTS is projected to increase revenues this year to 2B. Meanwhile the market cap is only 1.9B. They also continue to double EBDITA ever since inception. By 2025 the CEO lays out that they will be making 5B in revenues and over 500M in EBDITA. If we use CGIs current valuation for p/s that would value Converge at 11.5B in 2025 and would imply a price of $60 a share. The market is simply not valuing the insane growth that CTS is providing. Doubling profits while trading at a forward PE of 20 is completely irrational, where else can you get value and Zoom like growth in one stock?




Why should we believe the CEO?: Well he has a lot of experience in this sector before he founded CTS and has not only met previous expectations but surpassed them. This year alone they acquired over 7 new companies and 22 ever since IPO. He laid out a plan over 2 years ago and has executed ever since as were in phase 3 of growth now, the Euro expansion.


Future catalysts: Laid out by management they have shown extreme interests in expanding in Europe. They have signed NDAs with 6 companies that they are interested in acquiring and have recently hired 2 new management that specialize in the Europe IT space. This is happening in Q3! Also a potential dual listing in the US could definitely boost the eyes and capital on this stock!


Risks: Obviously with any investments there’s some risks. With CTS they diluted a lot this year. With a 175M offering at $7.50 in June and another offering in January for 86.5M at $4.85. Take in note that we may get diluted more in the future. Another is reliance on management. If we lose the CEO or one of the main executives that can really hurt the momentum of the company. Margins are also slim in this business 5-10% but is offsetting by the massive amounts of revenue.


Tldr: CTS is heavily undervalued. It’s easily the most attractive Canadian stock that should attract both value and growth investors.

The pandemic shifted a lot of people to buying more groceries, and lots of those things will probably stick with families that weren’t used to cooking or buying in bulk. Also, pandemic or no pandemic, Costco will be heavily utilized by the upper and middle class. Memberships being a big reason for their rev, and they are able to move lots of product. Basically they don’t really make a lot of money from selling products. Either way, I see their trajectory as going higher towards the beginning of earnings releases.

stocks,"I’m not telling you what to do with your money financially but as a publicly traded company I feel it’s necessary to expose Doordash for its manipulative practices it uses on drivers.

1. Doordash hides tips from drivers. The independent contractor driver has no idea how much money they are going to make from an order. The driver is forced to gamble in order to try and make any money using the service. For example if a customer tipped $20 Doordash will only show the driver $7 of the order until the order is completed. If the customer tipped nothing the driver won’t know if they are gambling on the order. 

Recently a group found a workaround to make orders transparent. To show the full amount of the orders. They shared this knowledge with all the drivers. Doordash never publicly acknowledged this but they never banned a driver for using it either. Instead Doordash quietly patched the ability to see the full order amount. Doordash can’t even develop a stable driver app but they are obsessed with manipulating drivers so much they prioritized this and patched it. 

2. Doordash uses in app psychological manipulation in order to get a driver to take unprofitable orders. New drivers have no idea they can decline orders without repercussion but the app forced you to basically decline the same order 4 times while you are driving in order to get to the next order. 

3. Doordash offers peak pay which is bonus pay to drivers to incentivize them to work during busy hours. The peak pay will say $5 extra pay per order from 5pm-9pm. The driver thinks they will make $5 extra per order however the app reduces and even removes the peak pay before it’s scheduled end time. Doordash does this simply to saturate the market. Once the market is saturated it takes the money away from the driver and hopes they will continue driving to take bad orders.

The business model is oppressive for the driver. Some drivers have to decline hundreds of orders daily just to make $50.

4. Prices going up with inflation? Guess what Doordash did? They reduced driver base pay from $3 per order to $2.50!

Please don’t support this company. I hope the mods are okay with this.",Please don’t support Doordash $DASH,1626143897

[Performance Chart (Intelligent Portfolio vs S&amp;P 500 vs Russell 2000](https://imgur.com/W4Q07Hm)

As you can see in the chart above, the intelligent portfolio has under performed both the S&amp;P 500 as well as the Russell 2000.

I have my portfolio set to as highly risky as possible which breaks down to the following:

* 81% - Stocks
* 9.7% - Fixed Income
* 2% - Commodities
* 7.3% - Cash

I wish there was a way to tell the portfolio not to keep such a large percent cash, but I get that there needs to be a reserve in case of a market dip so it can buy more shares of various ETFs.

I'm not trying to sway anyone one way or another about intelligent/robo portfolios, but figured the data might be interesting for anyone who is curious about their performance.

The difference in performance was a lot closer pre-pandemic but separated much more significantly during the covid recovery.

I'll probably continue to deposit my $100/mo into the portfolio and monitor the trends, but if I was simply looking to maximize my set and forget funds, I'd probably just go with VOO or SWPPX (which I also contribute to).",Schwab Intelligent Portfolio performance vs S&amp;P 500 and Russell 2000 Data,1626140699

Below is a portion of the benzinga article from the interview with AVPT (Avepoint’s CEO) 

Microsoft Partnership: AvePoint is the leading data management solutions provider for the Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) Cloud. 

The company has a 20-year relationship with Microsoft, Jiang said. For every $1 Microsoft earns, there exists $9 of partner opportunity. So rather than competing with Microsoft, AvePoint is competing within the Microsoft ecosystem, he said.

Outside of the current partnership with Microsoft, AvePoint provides services for salesforce.com inc (NYSE:CRM) and Alphabet Inc's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Docs. The company is also actively looking at working with Amazon.com, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS, Jiang said. 

Earnings And Analyst Coverage: AvePoint reported first-quarter financial results on May 20. The company announced total revenue of $38.8 million, up 19% year-over-year and SaaS revenue of $18.3 million, up 78% year-over-year.

AvePoint also raised its fiscal year guidance and announced that the company remains debt-free. 

AvePoint anticipates announcing its next quarterly financial results in early August. The company is expecting analyst coverage from numerous firms to be published within the next week, Jiang told Benzinga

For those of you who are unaware, $NLST has been going at it with google for over 10 years now. They have filed multiple lawsuits against google for theft of their 912 seminal patent. 

A seminal patent differs from a regular patent because the technology is deemed to be ""AN INVENTION SO IMPACTFUL THAT IT CRESTES OR SHIFTS THE TECHNOLOGY SPACE"". Netlists' technology essentially allows computers to access 4× more ram then it normaly would - the reason why google searches are so fast and has continued to stay a top the industry. 

Think of it like this ""Google - Powered by netlist."" 

So after years of appealing google has finally decided not to appeal, essentially agreeing to a settlement. Netlist CEO has already previously stated that he is seeking billions from google, so in essence, if google is agreeing to settle, then google is willing to pay billions. Intel had to payout over 2 billion earlier this year for a non seminal patent, so picture what netlist might get.

NLST currently has a market cap of 1.5B, so imagine what a settlement in the BILLIONS would do for it. 

It also recently was awarded $40 million from sk hynix, one of the biggest producers of semiconductors behind samsung as well as a supply sales agreement and will recieve royalties. 

They are also currently suing samsung for breach of contract. 

Their earnings are august 9th and theyre expected 0.16 per share as oppose to -0.01 the previous quarter. 

On top of everything they actually have really good technology. 

The google settlement is expected to be reached on september 17th.

stocks,"**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, July 12, 2021**

After a spurt in volatility last Thursday, stocks have shaken off any jitteriness, with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ) once again powering to fresh intraday records today. Looking ahead, market participants are waiting for Q2 earnings season to begin tomorrow, with two of the largest banks in the US, JP Morgan (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS), reporting results and Jerome Powell’s testimony before Congress later this week.

With Q2 earnings are fast approaching, market participants are gearing up for what is expected to be a repeat of Q1 record-setting season, with earnings expected to continue being super-charged by stronger than expected demand from savings-loaden consumers and the continued reopening of the US economy thanks to effective distribution of the coronavirus vaccine. So far, analysts are looking for S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 61.9% year-on-year in aggregate, according to FactSet data – an estimate UBS's Head of Equity Derivatives Research Stuart Kaiser said may still be ""need to be revised higher."" This would represent a sharp acceleration from the 50% year-on-year growth recorded during Q1’s earnings season.

A big part of the strong Q2 earnings growth is easy comparisons to the year-earlier period that represented the bottom of the Covid-19 earnings impact. But Q2 estimates also reflect genuine growth, with total index earnings expected to be up +8.8% compared to the pre-Covid 2019 Q2 period. In other words, even when compared to an earnings season 2 years ago, well before the coronavirus pandemic, this earnings season is expected to show very strong growth. Estimates for Q2 and beyond have been steadily going up, with the current +60.5% earnings growth rate up from +50.6% at the end of March and +41.6% at the start of January 2021.

Goldman Sachs strategist David Kosting said that market pariticpants should focus on three questions heading into this earnings season: (1) How will companies deal with rising material costs and supply chain disruptions? (2) How are companies planning to prioritize cash spending? (3) How will companies deal with policy uncertainties, especially surrounding a potential tax hike?

In addition to earnings season, market participants are also looking forward to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell giving his semi-annual Monetary Policy Report to Congress Wednesday and Thursday of this week. Analysts are expecting Powell to once again strike a dovish tone (meaning unlikely to take aggressive action against inflation and instead favor employment), given the mixed June Job Report, which saw a better than expected number of jobs added to the economy but the unemployment rate tick higher and last week’s meeting minutes which showed an increasing divide between members regarding the timeline to begin tapering quantitative easing. In my view, Powell is trying to do three things in the upcoming meeting: (1) reiterate his view that the recovery of the economy is not yet complete, (2) inflation is a result of pandemic-era disruptions, and (3) prevent a repeat of the 2013 Taper Tantrum, an unwarranted, silly, collective market-panic that triggered a spike in U.S. Treasury yields after investors learned that the Federal Reserve was slowly putting the brakes on its quantitative easing program passed during the height of the 2008-09 recession. Moving ahead, further economic reports on consumer price inflation and retail sales out this week are expected to once again underscore that the pace of economic recovery in the US remains limited by supply chain disruptions and labor market imbalances.

Kathy Jones, chief fixed income strategist at Charles Schwab said, “I think the recovery is on track, it’s really just the rate of change that has slowed. We couldn’t continue to grow at 9-10% GDP growth every quarter, so obviously it’s going to slow down. I think one of the things that got into markets that got \[Treasury\] yields tumbling was maybe the fact that the Fed was going to hike rates sooner than anticipated. That sends a signal to the long end of the bond market that maybe the Fed isn;t going to tolerate higher inflation for longer and that they’re going to step on the brakes sooner rather than later ... we don't think that's going to be the case though. We think the economy is doing well, yields will probably bounce back."" I agree with this sentiment. 

**Highlights**

* Over the weekend, Richard Branson became the first civilian to go to space with his own company Virgin Galactic (SPCE), a remarkable milestone as companies like Bezos’ Blue Origin and Musk’s SpaceX intensify competition in space tourism.
* Despite successfully completing the trip, shares of Virgin Galactic (SPCE) fell more than 10% after the company announced it planned to take advantage of the elevated stock price by selling $500 million in stock.
* Tesla (TSLA) Chief Executive Elon Musk on Monday defended the electric-vehicle maker's purchase of SolarCity Corp. in court, telling a Delaware judge that he didn't act improperly during the negotiating process. This comes in response to a lawsuit filed by TSLA shareholders that allege Musk forced the company to buy SolarCity, a solar-cell manufacturer, in order to save his investment in the company. Frankly, this lawsuit seems a little ridiculous to me given SolarCity has proven a smart acquisition.
* Walt Disney (DIS) said on Sunday that “Black Widow”, the newest Marvel movie, made $80 million in theater sales, the largest domestic opening weekend since “Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker” in 2019, a strong sign that appetite to go to the movies remains high among Americans. Comparatively, “Black Widow” made $60 million through streaming purchases.
* In yet another crackdown of big-tech companies, Chinese regulators are reportedly set to order Tencent (TCEHY) to give up their exclusive rights to music labels and pay a small fine.
* Broadcom (AVGO) is reportedly in talks to by SAS Institute, a software company with upwards of $3 billion a year in revenue in a deal valued between $15-$20 billion. This is yet another acquisition by one of the world’s largest semiconductor companies.
* Microsoft (MSFT) announced it was acquiring cybersecurity firm RiskIQ to help reduce risk amid “the increasing sophistication and frequency of cyberattacks”.

Might explode - I think there is a very good change that this might be the case;

1. March 18, 2021 $IPG is awarded a $90,000 Federal Grant for Scandium Material Research with McMaster University. When the Federal Government gets involved you know that good things are coming. Cooperation with McMaster is a very welcome development.
2. Then on May 18, 2021 it was announced that $IPG and Eck Industries Executed a Letter of Intent for Collaborative Scandium Material Research &amp; Development. 
3. June 9, 2021 - Imperial Mining Develops High-Recovery Extraction Process for Scandium and Rare Earth Elements for Crater Lake Mineralization.
4. Then June 23, 2021 Imperial Mining Receives Final Crater Lake Drill Results: Data Sent to Engineers for 43-101 Resource Estimation on TG Zone.

Now we are waiting for the big news on 43-101 Resource Estimate. This alone could send SP soaring. It should be done by the end of July. With the resource estimation in hand, likely in July, and completion of the metallurgical flowsheet, $IPG will commence work on delivering a Preliminary Economic Assessment (PEA) for the project some time this fall, as originally scheduled.

When the PEA comes in $IPG should be anywhere between 50 cents to $1.00. This is a golden opportunity!! I've been increasing my position accordingly. I think there is time to do that until the 43-101 comes in and then we will see high SP. On the other hand this is a virtually zero risk bet. No way this will slide. Only upside here.

stocks,"Very rarely do opportunities come along that bring me to drop more than 5% of my portfolio into them, but I've put about half of my portfolio into $CARV. Shorts have absolutley overextended themselves and are about to get obliterated here. But before I go into that, first, a bit about $CARV.

# What does $CARV do, and how are they financially?

$CARV is a bank that has been around for a while that provides all the typical banking services, but it focuses on Black/African American communities that have had limited access to banking services in the past. They've been around since 1948 and thus have helped a lot of people who were blatantly discriminated against by other banks. In other words, this is a very ethical company that has helped people at a major disadvantage. 

$CARV is at no risk of bankruptcy; they have a book value per share of $7.96, meaning that their share price is only trading at about 2.5x their net asset value (assets minus debts). Although they were once in a lot better shape (before the great financial crisis), they have been turning things around substantially with endorsements or collaborations from major banks such as Bank of America or Wells Fargo (e.g., Carver bank customers can now use Wells Fargo's ATMs free of charge, which is helping to expand their clientele). They have been seeing substantial growth lately; their total revenue last quarter was up 30.74% YoY and their net income was up 46.33%--though it should be noted that this growth is mostly due to the COVID-induced slowdown. Nonetheless, $CARV isn't about to go bankrupt by any means, so you don't need to worry about that with this stock.

# Why is $CARV the play? Shorts overextended themselves and are already fucked.

$CARV had a \~100% run up at the beginning of June. $CARV has an extremely small float (only 957k shares) so it moves a lot on very little volume. Shorts shorted $CARV down hard and kept their positions open. Recently, some famous dude on Twitter (I honestly can't remember who he is) tweeted about $CARV's high short interest, and the price exploded. According to a site I use (not sure if I can mention names here), $CARV currently has 70% short interest. On a float of less than a million shares. Shares on loan are 956k (including new loans today), with a float of 957k. Shorts are completely overextended on this stock. More importantly, the average age of the loans is 9 days, meaning that shorts opened their positions on average \~$12. ***Nearly all those shorts are completely underwater.*** 

When someone gets margin called, they're usually given 2-5 business days to cover. Big clients use big brokers and usually get five days. So we should expect that about five trading days after the jump Friday, which put every short underwater, they should cover. 

Moreover, ***CARV does not have options for shorts to create an unsqueezable position with***. For most stocks, if someone shorts, they can buy a call to make an unsqueezeable position. But CARV doesn't have options, so CARV shorts will have to cover no matter the asking price.

In other words, ***there is no need to squeeze anyone, these people are already fucked as long as the price stays at its current level.*** 

For proof of this, let's compare $CARV to $GME on GME's ascent.

# GME shows what will happen to CARV.

Everyone knows about GME; it was absurdly shorted and had an enormous squeeze. But how many of you were in GME early January, when it looked like it squeezed on 1/13? I was, which is why I noticed this parallel. I considered selling because I thought it was done. But it was just getting started, as is CARV.

On first glance, $CARV's daily chart looks fairly bearish, but it parallels the start of both of $GME's ascents. Given the enormous short interest and the fact that almost all shorts are currently underwater, I am expected margin calls soon. Take a look at the charts. 

First, look at CARV over the last three days. Note the \~100% increase on the first day, a much higher point on the second day (that still maintained a \~15% gain on the second day), and a drop on the third day. Note the volume trended down, though it's still early 7/12. 

Now look at GME back in early January; look in particular at its initial ascent on 1/13 through 1/15. The price action on GME from 1/13 to 1/15 is almost identical to CARV, though 1/14 did close higher than it opened and CARV didn't. 1/15 still had a big red day, closing down over 10%. But the shorts couldn't drop it further, and they were all underwater from positions opened early January through 1/13. Five trading days after 1/14, margin calls started, and the rest of January is history.

GME also had another launch at the end of February after coming down from its initial launch--similar to CARV. Take a look at GME 2/24-2/26. Again, the same pattern: A **huge** increase one day, followed by a modest gain next day, and third day that ended down and hit the short sale restriction as it did. But the price never dropped further, and GME took off again as margin calls began to hit.

# TLDR

$CARV is an ethical company and a unicorn of shorts overextending themselves. They're already squeezed as long as the price doesn't drop. Hop in and enjoy the margin calls.

stocks,"Here are a few reasons why I think NIO stands out from the crowd of upstart Chinese electric vehicle makers.

Demand is great. NIO delivered almost 22,000 vehicles in the second quarter, more than double its year-ago total. The company has gone to great lengths to build and maintain relationships with its growing army of loyal fans, who have returned the favor by placing lots of orders for its stylish electric vehicles. 

The balance sheet is strong. NIO was in real trouble in early 2020, when the pandemic hit just after a year in which it had made big investments to support its growth. But last summer's stock-price surge gave the company a chance to raise extra cash, and it didn't waste the opportunity. As of March 31, NIO had about $7.3 billion in cash on its books -- an ample reserve to weather the next big storm, if and when it arrives. 

NIO is still investing in growth. The company will add two sedan models to its currently all-SUV lineup next year, filling out its coverage of the premium auto market. And in May, it signed a new deal with its manufacturing partner that will boost its factory's output to 20,000 vehicles per month (from about 8,000 to 10,000 now) -- so it will have the capacity to deliver as its order book continues to expand.","DD on NIO, P.S I don’t believe China wants them to fail.

stocks," So, I did a DD on $PTON a few months ago, which brought me to this competitor company. I would’ve included it on my list of competitors in that post, but it hadn’t merged at the time.

I see this company as a potential 2-3x bagger either in the short-term or within 1-2 years, and here’s why.

**Overview:**

Beachbody ($BODY) is a fitness company that’s been operating for 20+ years (founded in 1998). They’ve just recently completed a three-way merger with FRX and Myx Fitness.

Beachbody has brought their digital content, fitness instructors and subscribers, as well as nutritional products to the table. Myx Fitness has brought their fitness equipment.

Under the name Beachbody, they plan to be a direct competitor of Peloton, but aiming at the “everyman” market as opposed to the health nut/upper-income market like Peloton. For that reason, their subscriptions and equipment are cheaper. 

\--------------------------------------------------------

**Here’s what makes it look good:**

* 400 million in cash on hand
* Zero debt 
* 3.2 million subscribers 
* 95.8% month over month digital retention 
* 1 billion in combined revenue estimated for 2021
* Has some big names on board – Arnold Schwarzenegger, LeBron James, Shaq
* Has experienced CEOS directing things, especially in the area of digital content service – Kevin Mayer (ex-CEO of TikTok, and ex-VP of Disney+), Carl Daikeler (CEO and founder of Beachbody), Jon Longdon (CEO of OpenFit and co-founder of Beachbody)
* Carl Daikeler claims he doesn’t plan to sell a single share

\------------------------------------------------------------

You can read more about the merger and the company’s info in [this article](https://www.marketwatch.com/press-release/forest-road-acquisition-corp-and-the-beachbody-company-announce-combined-first-quarter-2021-financial-results-for-beachbody-and-myx-2021-05-19-91591019?siteid=bigcharts&amp;dist=bigcharts&amp;tesla=y). 

So, basically, we’ve got a company with experience, seemingly good financials, a massive subscriber pool (many of whom are fanatical like PTON subscribers), and excellent retention rate.

You can read about the details of expected earnings, their plans and products through the [investor presentation](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5f75fdc89cf35e7524ec4b54/t/6023f07523d4531acaea9e8b/1612968070409/Beachbody+PIPE+Presentation.pdf).

&amp;#x200B;

**So, with all this promise, why is the price of the stock so low?**

Well, for one thing, it has just merged, and a drop after de-spacing while people lock in profits is common. Also, Beachbody hasn’t had much PR, so there hasn’t been a lot to push this stock up. It’s relatively undiscovered by the wider market and volume is low. 

Market makers have been using this to their advantage, and are having a great time pushing around retail. They’ve been shorting it heavily, taking it as low as it can go to make maximum profit.

For this reason, buying shares rather than options is the better choice. Last month, the MMs took the stock price down to precisely $9.99 at the very end of the day of expiry of $10 calls, so that they’d all expire worthless. The manipulation was blatant.

&amp;#x200B;

**So, if MMs are controlling this stock, why am I bullish?**

Because all it takes is a bit of PR and volume, and this stock could take off. The MMs are controlling this right now because they can, but it’s impossible for that to last forever once there’s PR, earnings and the wider market recognises its value. They’ve shorted it HEAVILY, and last I read it was at approx. 27% short interest percentage, and only 40,000 shares (https://fintel.io/ss/us/BODy) available to short.

It's also been the only other NYSE stock on the SSR list along with $AMC.

Catalysts are already starting which is recently pushing up the share price. The first 2 analysts have brought out their PTs – one at **$12** and another at **$16**, so analysts thus far are decidedly bullish on $BODY.

Beachbody’s CEO Carl states they plan to spend a lot of their cash on marketing, so we can expect to hear more and more about Beachbody in the coming months.

Now, I can’t say how much the MMs are allowing this price rise right now, but the fact of the matter is, in this current market and with all the catalysts expected to come, it’s highly unlikely they could maintain this low share price permanently. At some point they have to cover or reverse position. 

**Short Squeeze**

Some people are talking about a short squeeze with regards to this stock, which, yes, it’s a potential short squeeze candidate, but if there’s one thing $GME and $AMC has shown us, it’s that you need a LOT of buying pressure to even have a chance of that. It’s pretty rare to have a short squeeze happen, and I’m not hanging my hopes on that. The thing is, in my opinion, we don’t NEED a short squeeze here. The MMs must know that this isn’t a sustainable position for a growing company, but since we’re still early in the game, they can eke as much money as possible out of retail before more big boys and more retail buyers load in.

A lot of people, including myself, aren’t selling because it’s obvious this stock is worth more than its current price. It’s only a matter of time.

**Bearish Points:**

1) *There are many who say this company will fail because it’s got some MLM practices.* 

That would worry me if they hadn’t been in operation for 20+ years, and, as shitty as I sound, I’m not bothered since other MLM-type companies like Herbalife do just fine. I just want to make money on the stock. The fact that it’s got ex-Disney+ and ex-TikTok CEO on board makes me even more confident.

2) *Things are still speculative. We haven’t seen their earnings yet.* 

Yep, fair enough. There is still some risk in that regard. There’s also the likelihood this merger and future expenses like R&amp;D and marketing will cut into their profits, possibly making it negative for a year or two like Peloton was. However, this current market is very bullish and forward-looking, so I could see the stock price going up or maintaining anyhow, especially since it’s already so low. 

3) *This is a pandemic stock. After the pandemic is over, it’ll crash along with Peloton.*

It certainly looks like we're in a bubble right now, and many are holding their breath for when that bubble might burst, or at least have a bunch of corrections. I can see it happening with Peloton at some point (it’s already had a correction though it’s climbing back up), but this stock price is already so low, it can’t really fall much further, so in that way it’s very low-risk compared to a lot of other investments. Great upside, small downside. Also, the pandemic has changed things permanently, and while I agree it has given stocks like PTON a big boost, I’m of the belief that this technology is going to be the future, so I’d expect both PTON and BODY to recover eventually, even if they happen to be brought down by corrections.

**Disclosure:** I currently have 1,100 shares at $10.34. My PT is between $15-18 in the short-term providing the overall market stays bullish, and $25-35 within 1-2 years. As always, do your own DD, don’t take my word for it, etc., etc.",Beachbody ($BODY) DD,1626098349
stocks,"An oil play I have been finally looking for has arrived.

Vermillion Energy is a Calgary-based oil and gas company that operates in 10 countries (North America, Europe and Australia) and has proven to be a well-constructed company. For a tenth consecutive year, Vermilion has been recognized by the Great Place to Work Institute as the best workplace in Canada and for a second consecutive year in Germany and certified as a great place to work in the Netherlands for a sixth year.

Having high interests in many fields and offshore operations, the company has cut their dividend to pay off any financial obstacles and expand its company. It has a free cash flow of over 14% and sits at a staggering 5.32 P/E ratio. Its P/S ratio is also at 1.24.

Having picked up some steam, it has been crushed over the years but these valuations are a clear buy for me. I have a PT of $12-15 within the next 6-9 months.

*This list is geared towards day trading. With the momentum watchlist especially, I am typically in and out very quickly, only occasionally longer than a couple minutes, usually faster scalps.* Always have a plan when you enter a trade (for profit taking and for taking a loss), and use proper risk management for your account.

**Main Watchlist:**

Gapping UP:

* CLDX: Opening at new ATH. I'll be watching for further momentum, but also for weakness for potential shorting opportunities. 46 level could serve as resistance/support, will see what it looks like closer to market open. 
* SPCE: Coming down from highs in premarket, I'll be watching for potential shorting opportunities. Potential resistance level at 52 now. 
* UPST: Could test pretty significant resistance level at 125. If it can get up and hold above 125 I'll be bullish, as it would have crossed over relevant SMA's. 
* TAL: Premarket resistance at 22. Could see another leg up if it can get back and hold above the 22 level. 
* SONY: Gapping up over SMA(100) at the moment. I'll be watching to see if it holds up over 103.
* NIO: Potential resistance level at 46. Daily chart doesn't look great, could retrace back to the 43 level if it shows weakness this morning. 

Gapping DOWN:

* UAL: Resistance levels at 51 and 52, with possible support at 50. 
* AMC: Premarket resistance at 45. Could see more downwards movement if it breaks down below 44 and cannot recover. 
* APA: Potential support levels at 20 and 19.50. Could see upwards movement if it can get back above 20.35.
* INFY: Potential support at 20.75, potential resistance at 21.25. 

**Market Outlook:**

Stocks are looking at a mixed open after last week ended on a strong note. Worth noting that stocks have recovered off their premarket lows, for the most part. SPY is trading right around 435, and hovering near ATH levels. DIA is trading a bit over 347, and is a bit further off from ATH levels. Tech stocks are showing considerable strength, with QQQ trading just under 363. Gold and silver are slightly down this morning, while crude oil is also pulling back a bit. Marijuana stocks are down a bit in premarket trading, but nothing significant. Worth keeping an eye on for upcoming catalysts. Meme stocks are somewhat mixed, with AMC showing weakness.

Remember to use proper risk management, by making sure you size appropriately for your account and have a plan for every trade you enter (both for taking profits and cutting losses). Happy trading everyone :)","Morning Update for Monday, 07/12/21",1626094580

The company is present in almost every field of data storage: mobile phones, tablets, PCs, portable and wearable devices, as well as automotive, Internet of Things, industrial, etc. They also offer data center systems, and cloud storage services. The company sells its products under the G-Technology, SanDisk, and WD brands to original equipment manufacturers, distributors, resellers, and retailers. Their current market cap is $21.68 billion.

Western Digital may see a further increase in revenue due to the fact that disk-drive demand continues to be warped by the rapid adoption of Chia, a cryptocurrency that relies on large capacity drives to “farm” new coins. This applies only if the Chia trend continues and the demand for storage devices is sustained. Western Digital also pays out dividends with a yield of 2.87%.

stocks,"Goodwill is the present value of the excess paid for businesses representing acquired intangible assets.  The first time I heard of it was a number of years ago in a business class, but the real risks associated with it have taken a while to resonate.  I was recently going over a company that looked great.  Their profit margins are good, revenue is stable, expenses are somewhat predictable and most of the Wall Street ratios were better than satisfactory.  But when it came to the balance sheet, I noticed that a quarter of assets were goodwill.

This may mean absolutely nothing to you or it may sound alarm bells in your head.  Goodwill generally does not represent something you can buy or sell, and when you can buy or sell it there are usually abstract estimations of its value.  Very occasionally can a goodwill item actually have an accurate number associated with it on the value it might be sold at.  Some examples of goodwill items are patents, relationships, and talent.

Goodwill must be depreciated over 40 or less years.  Other than that, the values produced are first tied to the business acquisition costs and then more tied to the opinions of auditors and internal accountants. 

My old corporate finance textbook recommends that when analyzing the balance sheet, try removing goodwill​​ and maybe the same value from shareholders equity and see what it does to the company's overall health.  It may be a decisive factor in reducing your exposure to risk and financial heartache.  This correlation between goodwill and shareholders equity is entirely fictional because goodwill is not attributable to SHE directly, but the exercise may nonetheless make the company look much more risky.  For the company I was looking at, it certainly made a difference.

The company I was looking at when I came across these figures was Clorox if you would like to see for yourself.  The figures are from year end 2020.",The risk associated with goodwill,1626063356

stocks,"Good evening everyone. I thought it was important to go over this very important topic because I have read a lot about this all over Reddit. Some of the Elite Traders are going thru this. I am front lines with them on a daily basis. I wanted to tell everyone and anyone that it is ok, even the best of us have bad days, weeks, months, quarters....but rarely a year/years. I have been trading since very late 1994 and there is no way I can tell you everything was fine and dandy. The dot com crash of 2000 where I lost 75% off my peak was a true learning experience, and that has never happened again. But yes, I too have bad days, weeks or months. Last year with covid hit I was down about 25%, and that is because I was about 50% cash, had I been all in stocks I would have been down 40-50%...There are alot of lessons learned each time we are down.

It is fair to measure yourself against an index like the SP500 because since its creation it has been up 8% year over year.. However, if last month you were down, and the SP was up 3% it isnt fair to be down on yourself over this! It is cap weighted index where APPL accounts for nearly 25-30% alone! AAPL accounts for 20 of the Nasdaq 100! I too, was down the last few weeks when the market turned upside down. Give yourself some time before you measure yourself against an index or another trader. Do not be so down on yourself and follow the course.

If you want to measure yourself and get angry just look at 50% of the Nasdaq 100 that is off 33-50% off their highs.. Most of us trade tech and growth. Great company's always come back to make newer highs especially if they make cash and have earnings. So if your account is down even 50% but you are down on something solid rest assured it will come back 33-50%, Earnings season kicks off this week. And as long as you have something with earnings if the stock has been beaten down, dont fret this is the perfect time for your company to fight for proper valuation. (TCOM, SGEN, WBA, PTON, ZM, PDD) there are many more that are slammed off their highs, PDD is off 55%! If the company is solid think of this as a blip on the map....

If you are using the market to give you steady income daily, weekly it will be a roller coaster ride. Remember, a stock is a live auction, it rarely tracks the company performance in real time, and momentum/speculation moves stocks faster. That means it is very hard to always be right every single trading day my friends. Do not be so hard on yourself and it is very hard to have a steady flow of income unless you are working with sizeable capital. Dont fret my friends, earnings season is here and most of the stocks I trade have a low PE 20 or so, and they have consistently beat top and bottom line the last few quarters so I await the earnings reports! Please do not be down on yourself just yet.... the earnings reports will give solace! If you have a speculative stock with no earnings, and they lose money and burn cash good luck!","As a trader/investor there are bad days, weeks, months, even quarters..

Also, I’m not trying to hype people up on this stock, I’m just using it as an example. I got my information from Yahoo finance.

Anyways, here goes.

Revenue: $591 million
Net Income: $17 million
Assets: $747 million
Liabilities: $160 million
Equity: $587 million
Debt: $25 million

The past four years on Yahoo finance shows both revenue and earnings in the positives. I didn’t crunch number for YOY data simply because the numbers have been positive. The stock is currently $27.53. I didn’t do the P/E ratio just because I keep hearing that it doesn’t matter as much, especially based on last year. I ended up buying a few shares because the numbers are good and I don’t hear much about it on here or other sites, so I figured I may have found a good company to hold onto that many people may not have heard about yet.

SPACEPORT AMERICA, N.M. — Soaring more than 50 miles into the hot, glaringly bright skies above New Mexico, Richard Branson at last fulfilled a dream that took decades to realize: He can now call himself an astronaut.

On Sunday morning, a small rocket plane operated by Virgin Galactic, which Mr. Branson founded in 2004, carried him and five other people to the edge of space and back.

More than an hour later, a Mr. Branson took the stage to celebrate. “The whole thing was magical,” he said.

Mr. Branson’s flight reinforces the hopes of space enthusiasts that routine travel to the final frontier may soon be available to private citizens, not just the professional astronauts of NASA and other space agencies. Another billionaire with his own rocket company — Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon — has plans to make a similar jaunt to the edge of space in nine days.

In each case, billionaire entrepreneurs are risking injury or death to fulfill their childhood aspirations — and advance the goal of making human spaceflight unexceptional.

“They’re putting their money where their mouth is, and they’re putting their body where their money is,” said Eric Anderson, chairman of Space Adventures Limited, a company that charters launches to orbit. “That’s impressive, frankly.”

At 8:40 a.m. Mountain time, a carrier aircraft, with the rocket plane, named V.S.S. Unity, tucked underneath, rose off the runway and headed to an altitude of about 45,000 feet. There, Unity was released, and a few moments later, its rocket motor ignited, accelerating the space plane on an upward arc.

Although Unity had made three previous trips to space, this was its first launch that resembled a full commercial flight of the sort that Virgin Galactic has promised to offer the general public, with two pilots — David Mackay and Michael Masucci — and four more crew members including Mr. Branson.

This flight resembled a party for Virgin Galactic and the nascent space tourism business. Guests included Elon Musk, the founder of SpaceX; Michelle Lujan Grisham, the governor of New Mexico; and about 60 customers who have paid for future Virgin Galactic flights.

Stephen Colbert of the CBS program “The Late Show” introduced segments of the webcast that included some live video from inside the spaceship. After the landing, Khalid performed a new song.

When the fuel was spent, Unity continued to coast upward to an altitude of 53.5 miles. The four people in back unbuckled and experienced about four minutes of floating before returning to their seats.

Mr. Branson was accompanied in the cabin by Beth Moses, the company’s chief astronaut instructor; Colin Bennett, lead operations engineer; and Sirisha Bandla, vice president of government affairs and research operations.

As the space plane re-entered the atmosphere, the downward pull of gravity resumed. Unity glided to a landing back at the spaceport.

For well over a decade, Mr. Branson, the irreverent 70-year-old British billionaire who runs a galaxy of Virgin companies, has said he believes that commercial flights will soon begin. So did the 600 or so customers of Virgin Galactic who have paid $200,000 or more for their tickets to space and are still waiting. So did the taxpayers of New Mexico who paid $220 million to build Spaceport America, a futuristic vision in the middle of the desert, in order to attract Mr. Branson’s company.

After years and years of unmet promises, Virgin Galactic may begin flying the first paying passengers next year after two more test flights. But with tickets costing hundreds of thousands of dollars, this experience will, for now, remain out of financial reach for most people.

Founding a space exploration company was perhaps an unsurprising step for Mr. Branson, who has made a career — and a fortune estimated at $6 billion — building flashy upstart businesses that he promotes with a showman’s flair.

What became his Virgin business empire began with a small record shop in central London in the 1970s before Mr. Branson parlayed it into Virgin Records, the home of acts like the Sex Pistols, Peter Gabriel and more. In 1984, he was a co-founder of what became Virgin Atlantic, to challenge British Airways.

The Virgin Group branched out into a mobile-phone service, a passenger railway and a line of hotels. Not all have performed flawlessly. Two of his airlines filed for insolvency during the pandemic last year, while few today remember his ventures into soft drinks, cosmetics or lingerie.

The spaceflight company was of a piece with Mr. Branson’s penchant for highflying pursuits like skydiving and hot-air ballooning. And unlike many of the Virgin Group’s businesses, Virgin Galactic has been a major focus of Mr. Branson’s.

Virgin Galactic joined the New York Stock Exchange in 2019 after merging with a publicly traded investment fund, giving it a potent source of new funds to compete with deep-pocket competitors — and publicity, with Mr. Branson marking its trading debut at the exchange in one of the company’s flight suits.

The Virgin Group retains a 24 percent stake in Virgin Galactic.

Virgin Galactic’s space plane is a scaled-up version of SpaceShipOne, which in 2004 captured the $10 million Ansari X Prize as the first reusable crewed spacecraft built by a nongovernmental organization to make it to space twice in two weeks.

Mr. Branson initially predicted commercial flights would begin by 2007. But development of the larger craft, SpaceShipTwo, stretched out.

The first SpaceShipTwo vehicle, V.S.S. Enterprise, crashed during a test flight in 2014, killing one of the pilots. Virgin Galactic was then grounded until Unity was completed a year and a half later.

In 2019, Virgin Galactic came close to another catastrophe when a seal on a rear horizontal stabilizer ruptured because a new thermal protection film had been improperly installed.
The mishap was revealed this year in the book “Test Gods: Virgin Galactic and the Making of a Modern Astronaut” by Nicholas Schmidle, a staff writer at The New Yorker. The book quotes Todd Ericson, then the vice president for safety and test at Virgin Galactic, saying, “I don’t know how we didn’t lose the vehicle and kill three people.”

Mr. Bezos’ flight is to take place about 200 miles to the southeast of Spaceport America in Van Horn, Texas, where his rocket company, Blue Origin, launches its New Shepard rocket and capsule.

Although Blue Origin has yet to fly any people on New Shepard, 15 successful uncrewed tests of the fully automated system convinced the company it would be safe to put Mr. Bezos on the first flight with people aboard.

He will be joined by his brother, Mark, and Mary Wallace Funk, an 82-year-old pilot. In the 1960s, she was among a group of women who passed the same rigorous criteria that NASA used for selecting astronauts, but the space agency at the time had no interest in selecting women as astronauts. A fourth unnamed passenger paid $28 million in an auction for one of the seats.

Neither Blue Origin nor Virgin Galactic flights go high enough or fast enough to enter orbit around Earth. Rather, these suborbital flights are more like giant roller coaster rides that allow passengers to float for a few minutes while admiring a view of Earth against the black backdrop of space.

Mr. Bezos’ company emphasized the rivalry with Virgin Galactic for space tourism passengers in a tweet on Friday. Blue Origin highlighted differences between its New Shepard rocket and Virgin Galactic’s SpaceShipTwo including the fact that New Shepard flies higher, above the altitude of 100 kilometers, or about 62 miles, that is often regarded as the boundary of space. However, the United States Air Force and the Federal Aviation Administration set the boundary at 50 miles.

The company also noted the size of the New Shepard capsule’s windows, and called Virgin Galactic’s Unity “a high-altitude plane” in contrast to New Shepard’s rocket.
Mr. Bezos on Sunday congratulated Mr. Branson and his fellow crew on their flight. “Can’t wait to join the club!” he added in an Instagram post.

Blue Origin has not yet announced a ticket price, and Virgin Galactic’s earlier quoted fare of $250,000 may rise. But on Sunday after his trip, Mr. Branson announced a sweepstakes that will give away two seats on a future Virgin Galactic flight.

Joy-riding tourists will not be the only passengers on future suborbital flights. Both companies are selling flights to organizations including the Italian Air Force where scientists will conduct experiments that take advantage of the minutes of microgravity.

The era of nonprofessional astronauts regularly heading to orbit may also begin in the coming year. Jared Isaacman, a 38-year-old billionaire, is essentially chartering a rocket and spacecraft from SpaceX for a three-day trip to orbit that is scheduled for September.

In December, Space Adventures has arranged for a Japanese fashion entrepreneur, Yusaku Maezawa, and Yozo Hirano, a production assistant, to launch on a Russian Soyuz rocket on a 12-day mission that will go to the International Space Station.

Another company, Axiom Space in Houston, is arranging a separate trip to the space station that will launch as soon as January.

The orbital trips are too expensive for anyone except the superwealthy — Axiom’s three customers are paying $55 million each — while suborbital flights might be affordable to those who are merely well off.

But how many people are willing to spend as much as some houses cost for a few minutes of space travel?

Carissa Christensen, founder and chief executive of Bryce Space and Technology, an aerospace consulting firm, thinks there will be plenty. “Based on previous ticket sales, surveys and interviews,” she said in an email, “we see strong demand signals for multiple hundreds of passengers a year at current prices, with potential for thousands if prices drop significantly.”

Mr. Anderson of Space Adventures is less certain.

“Per minute, it’s like a thousand times more expensive than an orbital flight,” he said. “It’s crazy.”

Two decades ago, Space Adventures did sell suborbital flights including a ticket to Ms. Funk, who goes by Wally. “Wally Funk was one of our first customers,” Mr. Anderson said. “That would have been like 1998.”

The ticket price then was $98,000.

At one point, about 200 people signed up for suborbital flights, but none of the promised suborbital rocket companies was able to get their space planes close to flight. Space Adventures returned the money to Ms. Funk and the others.

Now this unproven suborbital market has whittled down to a battle of billionaires — Mr. Branson and Mr. Bezos.

“If anybody can make money and make the market work for suborbital, it’s Branson and Bezos,” Mr. Anderson said. “They have the reach and the cachet.”","Branson Completes Virgin Galactic Flight, Aiming to Open Up Space Tourism",1626033323

TLDR at bottom

I decided to try a back testing experiment where I would look at current and recent operations of a company ($GIL: Gildan) and come up with my own five year estimates for growth taking into account quantitative and qualitative factors.  The process was to look at old financials and come up with my judgement.  I have never analyzed $GIL before and I knew nothing about their financial state past or present. I read their annual reports in order from oldest to newest in order to maintain an unbiased opinion.  

I know that some of you will point out that I could have just said that I did this in order to make me look smart by having accurate growth estimates.  I assure you that the point of this post is to highlight the discrepancies between predictions and reality, and hopefully add something to your investing toolbox for you to think about.

**Ten years ago analysis:**

**(2011)** The balance sheet has a good structure.  Current assets along can cover all liabilities quite easily.  Debts are not a problem.  There has been recent sales and earnings with good profit margins hovering around 10%.  Operating cash flow is generating consistent cash flow.  Net cash flow was negative attributable to a large business acquisition so this year net cash flow was negative but on average could be expected to reach 100M annually.  

Acquisitions:

* The business they acquired was a sock supplier for 350M at a net asset premium of 137M.  
* They also spent 15M on 12M assets on a vertically integrated T-Shirt manufacturing facility in bangladesh.

Inventories are mostly finished goods (About 80% are finished goods) with the remainder being materials, spare parts, and partially finished goods.  Manufacturing equipment is about half of PPE and increased by 100M in the last year.  Goodwill increased by roughly the value excess of assets in the acquisitions.  They have an 800M RLOC with 209M drawn @ 2.3%.

Based on their past income statement data, I would not say it is unreasonable to expect 100M in revenue growth per year over the next five years.  They have increased sales by 300M per year, but to stay conservative I will use the figure of 100M YoY or about 5%. Earnings and OCF will follow this trend.  The balance sheet will stay strong, hopefully with the same structure of assets as we see now. Depending on their appetite, debt may increase if they keep up with large acquisitions.

What actually happened:

2016: 

\-Current assets went up about 500M, or about 60%.  Overall assets increased by 1B

\- Liabilities doubled, Retained earnings increased by about 50%

\- Sales increased by about 1.3B, or 250M per year. Overall increase of about 12% yearly

\- Earnings increased by about 4% yearly.  OCF increased by about 50%, or 8% YoY.

Their financial health got stronger overall.  Sales and OCF did much better than expected, and earnings slightly underperformed.  The operating environments during this period were quite good.  The world economy was experiencing growth after the financial meltdown in 2008 that was above average.  

**Five years ago analysis:**

**(2016)** The balance sheet has good structure.  Current assets are almost double liabilities.  Most current assets are inventory. Assuming that of these only finished products will be converted into cash and receivables nets 640M, which still covers all liabilities.  The company is on track to have almost no need for debt.  Sales are large compared to the balance sheet, and profit margins are and have been above 10%.  OCF is good, but ideally this number would be about 20% larger to cover current asset requirements with a larger debt coverage margin of safety.

They recently acquired a shirt manufacturer for 112M with 14M goodwill.  They also paid 102M for the assets + 26M goodwill in a lingerie company, the first acquisition of this sort.  

It would be reasonable to say that revenue can grow by about 250M per year or about 8% YoY. This is about half of the growth seen in the recent two years, so it is considered a conservaitve estimate.  Net income will likely trail this trend by 20-30% earnings growth has been slightly slower than revenue growth.  Earnings growth can be estimated to be 4-5% YoY, and OCF could follow this closely.  If they manage money right, total liabilities could shrink to ⅓ of total assets in the coming years, although debt may rise as a number if they continue their current acquisition habits.

What actually happened:

2021:

* Sales are at 2B, about a 35% decrease from 2016
* Net income is -220M
* Operating cash flow have decreased by 40%
* All three of my predicted growth rates were useless.  Revenue from 2019 year end was also much lower than the growth rates would have dictated. 
* Instead of selling more shears, they issued one billion in debt payable over the next six years with an average interest rate of 2.8%

It is clear that in periods of stable growth, it is much easier to be optimistic. Who would have been able to predict the pandemic? Certainly not me.  But that is not an excuse for being wrong.  This was a very interesting activity for me to do, and hopefully this can serve as a reminder that predictions and reality can very possibly have zero correlation.  The low growth in 2019 was not related to the pandemic, further proving that predictions - your own or from others or even professionals - have the possibility of being dangerously wrong.

TLDR:I tried to look at really old financials and predict what would happen in the companies near future.  It worked well from 2011-2016, but completely failed between 2016-2021.",Back testing growth predictions,1625974168

&amp;#x200B;

In general:  In high interest rates, bonds do better and stocks do worse than in lower interest rates.  High interest rates means more difficulty growing. It also implies the risk free rate is high so bond yields must rise with it in order to have any demand for corporate paper.

Basic Materials:

The interest rate to commodity price index is inverted.  This is because the demand for commodities falls with the level of economic activity.  This can be seen quite clearly by comparing a chart of interest rates with commodity prices.

The implications of high interest rates are divided across the industry.  Commodity producers will have more difficulty staying profitable and expanding operations.  Cash generation will be severely strained.  Commodity buyers on the other hand will find that expenses are much lower and it easier to get competitive prices.  There are some material producers that will suffer less than others.  In general, smaller companies suffer more because the larger ones are more capable of providing the most competitive prices.

Communication services:

Communications services do well in low interest rates, and tend to struggle in higher rates.  This sector is generally the most overpriced and most leveraged.  Stock prices in this sector may decrease more than the average market does.  In addition to lower stock prices, companies that require a lot of leverage will have difficulty expanding or continuing operations.  Established companies that have less capital intensive operations will fare much better, but still won’t be able to come up with the same revolutionary technologies that come from lower interest rate environments.

Technology:

This sector is unique because it is much newer and has not been exposed to high interest rates.  If the current environment of startups are extended, many startups will find difficulty finding funding and small companies with high debt will face similar problems.  For larger companies, a unique situation is presented.  These companies are known for constant acquisitions and with high interest rates, all of the talent in niche tech businesses will suddenly look much more attractive.

It is possible that the mega cap tech companies will be nearly unaffected because of their massive operating cash flows that are vital to normal life.  Many companies in tech have become very large with a low interest rate for the entirety of their existence.  It is possible that these companies suffer more than older companies of similar operations and size because of a lack of experience operating at higher interest rates.

Industrials:

These companies have mixed implications.  On one end, commodities and other material input are cheaper, but on the other end there is less demand for industrial products in an economic slowdown.  Revenue and cost of goods sold could be expected to decrease, creating smaller, more profitable businesses.

A nice way to think about this is to examine the airplane manufacturing industry in a high interest rate environment.  The manufacturer can acquire the materials and possibly prefabs for the plane for cheaper.  The gross margin on the individual plane is higher as a result, but in the general economy, consumer activity is lower, so there is less traveling and a resulting lower demand for aircraft.

Health Care:

Health care is much less volatile than the average market because the demand for healthcare services is mostly disjoint from economic activity.  The main concerns in health care are shared with the rest of the economy - mostly issues arising in debt refinancing and upgrading or acquiring fixed assets.

Utilities:

Utilities generally underperform in high interest rates.  They take on more debt, require consistent servicing of fixed assets, and are slower to increase revenue than other industries.  When operating conditions are staying similar (utility costs for consumers are not increasing much) and interest rates are high, utilities have a much more difficult time covering capex and depreciation.

Consumer staples:

Consumer staples are historically less volatile than most of the market.  Consumers may not be buying luxury goods or a second home at high interest rates, but like healthcare, consumer staples are not things that are optional for most people.  \[Most?\] Consumers are not going to stop purchasing food and toiletries just because their variable rate debts are becoming more costly.

Finance:

Finance tends to do well in high interest rate environments.  They are able to write higher rate loans, and demand for loans increases.  Insurance historically issued higher premiums.  Financial firms can be viewed as the most obvious beneficiaries of high interest rates at the cost of most other industries.",What high interest rates COULD do to different industries,1625949217

For example, Spy(Currently priced at $435) buying a $435 call and selling a $436 call dated 1 year out would cost $50, but if by the end of that period spy is above 436, the contract is worth $100. If it is below 435 then it would expire worthless. So more or less your are betting that spy increases over a year at 1:1 odds.

I don't understand this. While it possible to lose your entire underlying, if someone were to make this debit spread purchase every month over the past 35 years instead of just purchasing the underlying they would be up significantly over just buy and hold. It would never work to put your portfolio on these positions as they can go to zero, BUT it would make sense to make this ""bet"" monthly instead of buying spy as part of a DCA strategy using work income. 

If the market is always on a slight path upwards, than I would win far more of these spreads than lose. The only way I can think this wouldn't work over a long time period is if SPY decreased year over year for 5 years or so, but the longest stretch that these contracts would expire worthless was 36 months. There is certainly risk, but it seems like the expected value of the spreads should be higher than $50.

Vertex Pharmaceuticals is a large-cap American biopharmaceutical company which uses rational drug design to develop treatments for several disorders. The stock has been long overlooked by retail investors but is no stranger to institutions -- massive hedge funds such as Renaissance Technologies, Point72 and Man Group are all long with large positions. Currently, there are several catalysts for growth in the upcoming years for Vertex. 

Here is some analysis regarding Vertex’s operations, financials and future growth prospects…

&amp;#x200B;

1.  TRIKAFTA

*“Cystic fibrosis, a rare, progressive, life-threatening disease, results in the formation of thick mucus that builds up in the lungs, digestive tract, and other parts of the body. It leads to severe respiratory and digestive problems as well as other complications such as infections and diabetes. Cystic fibrosis is caused by a defective protein that results from mutations in the CFTR gene. While there are approximately 2,000 known mutations of the CFTR gene, the most common mutation is the F508del mutation. Trikafta is a combination of three drugs that target the defective CFTR protein. It helps the protein made by the CFTR gene mutation function more effectively. Currently available therapies that target the defective protein are treatment options for some patients with cystic fibrosis, but many patients have mutations that are ineligible for treatment. Trikafta is the first approved treatment that is effective for cystic fibrosis patients 12 years and older with at least one F508del mutation, which affects 90% of the population with cystic fibrosis or roughly 27,000 people in the United States” ­*– US Food and Drug Administration 

Trikafta is the first FDA approved treatment for cystic fibrosis which is capable of treating 90% of patients with the disorder. Vertex currently has a firm economic moat on medicinal treatment for cystic fibrosis as it is the only company with FDA approved drugs for treating the disorder. Trikafta accounts for 70% of Vertex’s revenues and has the potential to drive far more profit for the company with the massive expanding global cystic fibrosis therapeutics market. Grand View Research expects the global cystic fibrosis therapeutics market to grow at a rate of 16.7% CAGR until 2025. Vertex could see growth which far exceeds that of this market due to its ever-growing share in the market. Essentially, the global cystic fibrosis therapeutics market growth rate + Trikafta’s market share growth rate would equate to Vertex’s revenue growth rate with Trikafta. With the drug’s increasingly large presence abroad due to the new approval in Canada as well as across Europe in several countries (57% increase in product revenue in Europe from 2020-2021), Trikafta could become an absolute cash-flow machine for Vertex. At the cost of $311,000 for Trikfta, Vertex could mass up to $8.4B in annual revenue if it were to capture the entire US market share alone. While the drug brought in just over $3.8B in 2020, there is still lots of room for Trikafta in Vertex’s domestic market, not to mention the great potential to scale internationally which has already been initiated.

&amp;#x200B;

2.  GROWTH

Revenue YoY Growth: **33.10%** **LTM**

Diluted EPS YoY Growth: **81.55%** **LTM**

Cash from Operations YoY Growth: **63.03%** **LTM**

Past 5 years Annual Earnings Growth: **53.9%**

As Trikafta’s patent has 16 years until expiry (expiry in 2037), Vertex’s largest source of revenue is here to stay and will continue to grow with the increasingly large demand for such treatment. Any new advances in pipeline for Vertex would also drive tremendous growth for additional revenues. On average, analysts are forecasting earnings growth greater than 20% for the upcoming year, however, with the average earnings surprise of 11.65% from the last four quarters, I believe that earnings growth &gt;30% is fair and to be expected.

Vertex’s high return on equity of 23.0% exceeds the industry average of 16.6% which demonstrates the company’s ability to successfully generate income and growth from equity financing – another positive and promising sign for future growth.

3.  VALUATION

VRTX has become increasingly cheap over the past few years. The stock has risen significantly in the same time that its P/E multiple has significantly decreased. The stock now trades at 18.81x earnings 15.96x forward earnings, representing a 1.59 PEG. This puts VRTX far below the Nasdaq biotechnology industry average of 30x earnings. VRTX is currently extremely cheap based on the most common valuation metrics.

Based on a discounted cash-flow analysis of VRTX\*, an intrinsic value of $406.58 can be extrapolated which presents a &gt;50% discount to its current share price of $197.74 (assumptions include a discount rate of 6.5% based on the calculation cost of equity).

This is all to say that VRTX has some serious deep value and a return to industry average earnings multiples or simply maintaining a similar valuation based on earnings would provide drastic upside (&gt;50%) based on future outlook.

&amp;#x200B;

4.  BALANCE SHEET

Quick Ratio: **4.20**

Current Ratio: **4.40**

Debt/Equity: **0.00**

LT Debt/Equity: **0.06**

Vertex Pharmaceuticals’ balance sheet is extremely strong with minimal debt relative to cash and current assets. The company has also made it clear that they are looking to use their large cash reserve for the acquisition of both drugs and of other pharmaceutical/biotech companies. There is virtually no risk debt-wise for Vertex – a rise in interest rates would not pose troubles to the company at all. Vertex’s current financial health is certainly the best in the biotech industry. 

&amp;#x200B;

5.  RESEARCH &amp; DEVELOPMENT

Vertex is in the process of developing several breakthrough therapies for serious diseases and has shown promising success with many of their clinical trials. FDA approval for any of these products would be highly significant for Vertex and extremely rewarding for shareholders. In the event that Vertex is successful in their cell therapy for type-1 diabetes, they could potentially cure type-1 diabetes and thus would consequently capture a large share of T1D market that is expected to grow to $24B by 2029\*. Vertex is continuing to advance in the development of molecular, cellular and genetic therapies aimed at treating many serious diseases. Overall, Vertex is in the process of developing revolutionary treatments that could significantly disrupt the biotech industry. Below is the stated progress on Vertex’s R&amp;D from the latest 10k…

*Beta Thalassemia and Sickle Cell Disease*

In December, we and our collaborator, CRISPR, announced positive interim data from 10 people with TDT or SCD treated with CTX001 and that 20 people with severe hemoglobinopathies have been dosed with CTX001 in the ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical trials. Enrollment and dosing are ongoing, and completion of enrollment in both clinical trials is expected in 2021.

*Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency*

Enrollment is ongoing in a Phase 2 proof-of-concept clinical trial for the corrector VX-864. We expect data from this clinical trial in the first half of 2021.

We discontinued development of VX-814, our first corrector, based on the safety and pharmacokinetic profile of VX-814 observed in a Phase 2 clinical trial.

*APOL1-Mediated Kidney Diseases*

Enrollment is ongoing in a Phase 2 proof-of-concept clinical trial designed to evaluate the reduction of proteinuria in people with APOL1-mediated FSGS after treatment with VX-147. We expect data from this clinical trial in 2021.

*Type 1 Diabetes*

We are developing a cell therapy designed to replace insulin-producing islet cells in patients with T1D. We are pursuing two programs for the transplant of these functional islets into patients: transplantation of islet cells alone, using immunosuppression to protect the implanted cells, and implantation of the islet cells inside a novel immunoprotective device. In January 2021, the FDA cleared our IND for VX-880, the islet cells alone program. We expect to initiate a Phase 1/2 clinical trial evaluating this program in the first half of 2021. This clinical trial will involve an infusion of fully differentiated, functional islet cells, and chronic administration of concomitant immunosuppressive therapy, to protect the islet cells from immune rejection. 

*Investment in External Innovation*

\-  We entered into a collaboration with Skyhawk Therapeutics, Inc., or Skyhawk, for the discovery and development of novel small molecules that modulate RNA splicing for the treatment of serious diseases. 

\-  We entered into a new collaboration with Moderna, Inc., or Moderna, aimed at the discovery and development of lipid nanoparticles and mRNAs that can deliver gene-editing therapies to lung cells for the treatment of CF. 

\-  We entered into a collaboration with Affinia Therapeutics, Inc., or Affinia, to gain access to a novel library of AAV capsids to support on our ongoing research and development efforts in genetic therapies, including DMD, DM1 and CF.

&amp;#x200B;

6.  OTHER POSITIVE SIGNS

·  $1.5B share repurchase program (June 2021-December 2022)

·  High net income margin: **49.00%**

·  Large hedge fund ownership

·  Average analyst price target **&gt;$260**

·  Buy-Strong Buy consensus across Wall Street

·  No underperform or sell targets

&amp;#x200B;

**TDLR:**

Vertex Pharmaceuticals presents remarkable upside for growth with their current products which are continuing to gain market share in an ever-growing therapeutics market, as well as with several breakthrough therapies which have shown to have promising results in recent clinical trials. Such high growth prospects paired with an undervalued company with solid financials makes for a great investment especially at the cheap price it is currently trading at.

Introduction:

This is my First DD, so please be kind while I figure out my style, and how I focus on topics. 

I should note, that I am not a financial advisor/adviser or a consultant, and that this is not financial advice. Always seek sound financial advice from your consultant or financial advisor before investing in the stock market. I am a grapefruit, and the stock market is a casino.

Disclosure:  No positions current in this stock, planning to go Long, likely for between 100 to 500 shares.

Why did I pick this stock? I’m running an experiment reviewing various services’ “recommended” buy stocks over time, and this one has been turning a profit when almost all others are in the red. Pft. Some recommended hot buy stocks, all down. But that got me to look closer. Thursdays market dump? This stock slid, then immediately was bought up with a climb all throughout the day. Hmm. Caught my eye little stock. Zack’s says you’re just a hold now, so why are you doing well this week? Tradingview says RXRX is a strong buy.

They are Growing: 

Jul 1 2021 Recursion Pharmaceuticals (RXRX) said Thursday it has signed a lease agreement with Vestar for an additional 100,000 square feet of space to double the size of its Salt Lake City headquarters. 

In 2018, the biotech firm signed a lease for 100,000 square feet of space at The Gateway complex in downtown Salt Lake City.

The company expects to expand into the newly-leased space in Q2 2022.

Multi Year deal:

Summary: If you like tech, AI, and Biotechnology stocks – this might be the investment for you. A budding company on the market, but with the initial startup over, this company is planting itself and growing quickly.

Personal thoughts: I expect the company to post losses for another quarter or 2, until it is done expanding and growing, as it develops and takes on clients and furthers its technology. There may be a buying opportunity with the next earnings release if it posts another surprise loss greater than estimates (due to its expansions, partnerships, and Toronto location this quarter). RXRX has a low PB Ratio of under 3, utilizing TD’s fundamental Book Price. I intend to buy and hold Very LONG.

Alternatives and competitors: Relay $RLAY (Small molecule drug discovery), Pfizer and IBM Watson, Sanofi uses Exscientia AI, Roche Subsidiary Genentech uses AI (see the above Principals and the board of directors, some are from Roche and Genentech).",$RXRX Recursion Pharmaceuticals Inc DD,1625892049

stocks,"I’ve been thinking about a post I read here recently. Basically, someone said they started buying stocks six months ago and have been in the red since until finally breaking even this week. As a beginner, it’s so difficult, because you’re excited and you understand the market returns 7-10% per year vs. nothing as cash. So six months later, when your carefully selected stocks stink, it feels bad, man.

I am here to tell you to HOLD your ridiculous stock, and to wrap your head around the idea that a LOT of people have been at this for a very long time. Your stocks are doing badly because people years before you thought the same thing you did: this is a great company! And they doubled, tripled, whatevered their money, and are now selling. This results in you having an unrealized loss or reduced unrealized gain that only becomes real IF YOU SELL. But you don’t have to realize it. Because you haven’t lost money. Your stock has simply lost its SHORT-TERM momentum. 

One of my recent stinkers has been TSM which I bought at the literal top in February. There are lots of stocks like this in tech, renewables, anything ARK. Same with crypto. And all for the same reason – people are cashing out! An analogy would be sitting at a slot machine right after somebody else just hit the jackpot. Bummer in the short term, but it’s still a good machine! Back to TSM, here’s a scenario: Imagine someone buys at the literal top in January 2018 @ $46. Then the stock drops and is stuck below that for 20 months straight until October 2019 when it finally breaks above $46. From there, it hangs out around the low 50s for several months until July 2020 when it nearly TRIPLES in value peaking above $140 in Feb 21. Sure, the pattern mimics what happened in the broader market, but that’s the point. A TSM holder would be up over 250% today. That's sure better than 7-10%.

Right now, my human emotion is thinking “boo-hoo, I am still down now while others are doing well.” But that’s not what matters. For most people, buying individual stocks isn’t a game of making a quick buck. It’s a game of being capable, consciously and financially, to wait it out – sometime for years – for these kinds of gains. This concept was never explained to me, but I think it’s an important lesson for beginners so they don’t sell a good thing and get taken advantage of when they miss the rocket emoji.",A word to new investors: HOLD!,1625880630

SJW Corp stands for Social Justice Warrior Corporation.  Their main line of business is holding and operating water utilities companies. HQ in San Jose  They originate in san jose and have 4 subsidiaries:

* San Jose water company provides water to 231 000 connections in san jose
* SJWNE has water companies in the northeast. They have 139 000 connections
* SJWTX provides 20 000 connections in Texas
* SJW Land owns land and develops it in Tennessee

1 connection can supply 1 standalone structure.  They serve about 1.54 Million people.

They have been acquiring some utility companies recently.  They also in a way get to determine the price of water.  This year they have made a request to increase their prices by 3%.  Because the Mexican government has been burning water, there will be less and less water each year because the Mexican government is burning water.

I am extremely bullish $SJW.  Their financial health is completely disjoint from the regular economy.  If you looked at a chart of their revenue, earnings, cash flows, asset/debt structure, buybacks/selloffs you wouldn't even notice the 2008 financial crisis.  They were completely unaffected by it.  When I do DD, I dig as deep as I can.  You can see the process I do in some of my older posts.  I am in the process of this for $SJW and things are looking very good for them as long as they can make it through 2021 without selling shares or taking out more than 180M in debt.

Boring:

They have revenue growth and never had negative earnings in the past 15 years.  Profit margins have been at least 20% over the past two decades and are at around 40% YTD. Their current debt structure is not sustainable, but It is looking much more manageable in the future.  They have also consistently been increasing their operating cash flows.  They have a lot of debt issues right now.  This is throwing off the D/E and current ratios.  Wall Street hates to see some of these values when they check their ratios so the stock is at a lower price than it should be and is being overlooked by the institutions.  Their returns are solid and should be expected to always be solid because they are so disjoint from economic conditions.  It’s not like anybody is going to decide to stop showering and washing the dishes just because your rent went up and milk is getting more expensive.",$SJW DD: Water Company,1625879387

I’ve been thinking lately about developing my own portfolio of stocks, looking into potential growth areas and selecting certain stocks. 

However, I can’t do it myself. I don’t have the knowledge, brains, resources. So why don’t I just copy. I’ve realised I don’t need to be creative or inventive to be profitable investor I can just copy people who are better than me. 

So firstly, how do I find, say, the top 10 most profitable hedge funds or single investors over the last decade and identify the common stocks held by each and their portfolio allocations and just copy them. Is there a website I can use for this? 

Secondly, why wouldn’t I want to do this? What are the down sides? 

E.g. if the best 10 hedge funds invest in Microsoft with decent allocations, I’ll just put money in Microsoft and leave it.

stocks,"Let me start by saying that I love Spotify and have been using it for over seven years. Everything about the platform is great and like many others, I have no plans of switching. The algorithm is unlike anything I've experienced on a music streaming app and has helped me discover countless new artists and genres. I’m sure you have felt a similar experience. Unfortunately, none of these amazing features should allow an investor to turn a blind eye to an obscene valuation. As history has shown, Wall Street will eventually make you pay the price. People quickly forget that Pandora Media was one of the world’s leading internet radio providers before collapsing due to more competition, and eventually was bought by Sirius XM.

      Growing Sales Doesn't Justify its High Valuation. Spotify is currently valued as a high-margin, wide-moat business. Investors are willing to pay a premium now for profits that aren't expected for at least four to five years. Bulls love to only focus on the impressive revenue and MAU growth, huge podcast signings, and overall great product. The question I always follow up and ask is, “How much more room is there to grow?”. Spotify has already absorbed close to 35% of the music streaming market as of 2019 and with a number of new platforms emerging each year, it’s only going to get more competitive. Some reports are claiming that Spotify’s share has declined closer to 30% as of 2020 but these are difficult to verify.

      If Spotify can’t generate a profit now, when will they? Their explosive growth and exclusive content signings are costly and while it looks good in the near term, it doesn’t imply a sustainable business model. On top of that, Spotify’s high EV/EBITDA (can’t use profit margins since negative) imply it’s trading well above fair value vs. similar names such as Netflix, Sirius XM, or Apple.

      Some may argue that it is unfair comparing a low/negative EBITDA with companies that have stronger multiples, but to me, that is the point I'm trying to make. Spotify doesn't deserve this valuation given its low-margin business. If management can prove to investors that it can scale AND improve operating margins, then it will deserve the valuations of Netflix and Apple who already have 18-25% net income margins. 

      Royalty Fees Remain a Major Concern. One of the biggest things I feel Wall Street fails to effectively understand with Spotify is its painful royalty fee structure. 73-80% of the company's revenue is subject to this in a given year, and it isn't going anywhere. There are no economies of scale or optimization strategies that will fix this; it's a constant payment to recording owners such as Universal Music or Sony that eat up the vast majority of Spotify's revenue. Figure 3 shows Spotify’s unchanged gross margins for the last three years despite impressive top-line growth.

      It's even more surprising when you find out that Spotify is one of the worst paying streaming services out there. There isn’t much more room for management to decrease payouts or else they risk losing more market share.

      Why is that important you might ask? Well, one of the hottest topics in music streaming right now (has been for years) revolves around artists, who are demanding to be paid more and rightfully so. This does not bode well for Spotify’s low payout coupled with more streamers entering the market who will try to gain exclusive access from artists by paying them more. If Spotify decides to increase payouts to retain artists, it's only going to hurt their bottom line. 

      Competition From Apple Music Will continue to be an issue for Spotify. Earlier this year, Apple unveiled its lossless streaming and spatial audio which is essentially a new enhanced way to listen to your favorite artists. It's a relatively new feature that launched in June and I believe as more people become aware of its better high-resolution stream offering, there is potential for them to take more market share from Spotify. I’m not claiming to be a music expert, but many blogs/articles are out there touting Apple’s achievement and we have yet to hear from Spotify on their next move. They may match what Apple has released, but until then, it has become a new near-term risk for Spotify. 

      Don't Sleep on Spotify's Debt. Although Spotify currently generates a healthy operating cash flow, it's important to recognize the $1.8 billion in debt on its balance sheet. In early 2021, Spotify raised $1.3 billion in unsecured notes. For what exactly? Many are speculating on the uses. An acquisition? General corporate purposes? Paying out more to artists? That remains to be said, but regardless this adds a new risk factor to Spotify if it cannot execute on a plan to pay off these notes due in 2026. The company does have a history of getting out of a high debt situation. Prior to going public in 2018, Spotify had raised approximately $1 billion of convertible debt at a roughly $10 billion valuation with private investors before selling it off to Tencent for the direct listing. Kind of weird when you’re competitor owns a piece of your company after going public.

      Spotify is a tricky business to evaluate. There aren't any fair comparables (I've seen research analysts use Netflix and Amazon for multiples) to accurately value it. So, what is a fair value for a company that can generate massive revenues, has a superior product, but can't make a profit? I'm a firm believer that investors eventually lose patience with a company that doesn't improve bottom-line margins. Does it take five years? Ten? After going public in mid-2018, Spotify traded range-bound between $105-200 per share and appeared to be fairly valued until April 2020 when it began to take off. In my opinion, this more than 100% increase to $350 per share was not justified given the company's inability to improve profit margins while management gave no indication that things were drastically changing. Some will argue that higher sales and improving MAU's played a role but that was already factored into the share price prior to the run-up. Even though Spotify's share price is down 28% from its February high, there is still room to fall.

stocks,"Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning July 12th, 2021.

# **Earnings season begins in the week ahead with eye-popping growth set to validate market’s 2021 run - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/09/earnings-season-begins-in-the-week-ahead-with-eye-popping-growth-set-to-validate-markets-2021-run.html)**
*****
&gt; Second-quarter earnings reporting season gets underway in the week ahead and eye-popping results could validate a market that continues to easily shake off any concerns on its steady march to record high after record high.
*****
&gt; The second quarter’s profits for S&amp;P 500 companies are expected to be up 65% from the same quarter a year ago in the depths of the pandemic, according to Refinitiv. The growth will be led by a near 570% increase in profits for industrials, one of the hardest hit sectors during the pandemic.
*****
&gt; “The second quarter could be as good as it gets for economic growth,” said Callie Bost, senior investment strategist at Ally Invest. “Earnings growth may slow, but analysts still expect S&amp;P profits to grow by double digits in the next two quarters. It’s crucial not to lose faith in the market just because the economy’s strongest growth may be behind us.”
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 climbed to yet another record on Friday following a minor setback on Thursday. Banks and other stocks linked to an economic comeback led the way. With Friday’s gain, the benchmark posted a 0.4% gain for the week and its sixth positive week in seven, bringing its 2021 gains to over 16%.
*****
&gt; The financial sector starts the earnings season off with reports from JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs Tuesday. Bank of America, Citigroup and Wells Fargo report Wednesday, and Morgan Stanley and Truist report Thursday.
*****
&gt; The banking industry is expected to produce blowout results for the second quarter with S&amp;P 500 financial sector earnings doubling year over year, according to Refinitiv. Major banks recently announced they will boost their dividend payouts after the Federal Reserve gave lenders a thumbs-up as all 23 passed the central bank’s stress test.
*****
&gt; Bank stocks led Thursday’s sell-off on Wall Street as some investors took bets off in the face of a surprising drop in Treasury yields. They then immediately snapped back Friday. Strong earnings result could help stabilize the sector that gyrated amid intensifying worries about slowing growth.
*****
&gt; # Big earnings numbers ahead
Among other sectors, consumer discretionary companies are also expected to see a big profit comeback, with earnings up 271%, according to Refinitiv. Energy companies are expected to see earnings bounce back by 225%, and materials are expected to see earnings growth of 115%. Tech lags those sectors with just a 31.6% gain. Utilities are expected to see earnings decline by 0.9%.
*****
&gt; “Once you pass the peak of economic growth as well as earnings growth, you do get higher levels of volatility,” said Matt Stucky, portfolio manager, equities, at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management Co. “We still think the path of least resistance is higher when it comes to equities but with more volatility than we’ve had.”
*****
&gt; He said he expects stocks to continue to make gains but to grow at a much more normal level. “There’s fundamental reasons to be optimistic about the market in the next year,” said Stucky. He said earnings should be strong and companies that can pass along higher costs will raise prices.
*****
&gt; # Inflation
There is also some important data ahead, particularly the Consumer Price Index on Tuesday. CPI inflation rose at a higher than expected annual rate of 5% in May, and June could also be hot. The Fed has said it would allow inflation to rise above its targeted 2% level, and watch an average inflation rate.
*****
&gt; “I think all of the inflation prints are going to take on added importance,” said Jim Caron, head of global macro strategy at Morgan Stanley Investment Management. “It’s not a question of whether it will fall. It’s whether it will fall fast enough to make the Fed remain patient. If it’s just lingering around a high level, that’s not good.”
*****
&gt; All eyes will be on the 10-year Treasury yield’s reaction to the data given the equity market took its cues from the bond market for most of the past week. As the 10-year yield dove to 1.25% on Thursday, the lowest since February, the equity market dropped, believing bond investors were signaling an economic global slowdown could be ahead. As yields snapped back on Friday, so did equity markets.
*****
&gt; Other data includes Producer Price Index Wednesday and retail sales for June on Friday.

&gt; # Stocks Are Going Streaking

&gt; To quote the great Frank the Tank from Old School, “We’re going streaking!” Although Frank had another idea, stocks have been streaking in some historic ways, both near-term and longer-term.

&gt; Let’s start with the more recent action. The S&amp;P 500 Index was recently higher seven consecutive days for the first time since last August, but even more impressive is it made new highs all seven of those days. You have to go back to June 1997 to find the last time we saw a streak like that! Incredibly, this has happened only eight other times since 1950 and stocks were higher a year later every single time.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/7.7.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Stocks have also streaked to monthly gains for five consecutive months. “Although a five month win streak for the S&amp;P 500 feels like a lot,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick, “a year later stocks were higher 25 out of 26 times after such long monthly win streaks. So the real strength could only be beginning.”

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, five month win streaks tend to be followed by strong performance over the next 12 months.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/7.7.21-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Lastly, the S&amp;P 500 has streaked to five consecutive quarterly gains. Some more color on this:

&gt; * The average return a year later has been only 6.6% because of very poor returns during the Great Financial Crisis. The median return a year later, though, is a solid 10.4%.

&gt; * The last time it was up five straight quarters was in the fourth quarter of 2016, when it went on to gain nine consecutive quarters.

&gt; * One year after that streak of five quarters stocks managed to gain more than 19% a year later.

&gt; * It has gained more than 5% for five consecutive quarters. Only from Q4 1953 through Q4 1954 did that last happen and stocks gained another 26% the following year.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/7.7.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; There is no doubt that stocks have put up some amazing streaks lately and history would suggest the path of least resistance remains higher. We listed some potential near-term worries in Three Things That Worry Us, but bigger picture going out a year or so, this bull market looks alive and well and these recent streaks do little to change that.

&gt; # Mega Cap Stocks Relatively Strong

&gt; Mega cap stocks are an important area to watch and have been an area of our focus recently as the relatively small number of names hold a large weight within the S&amp;P 500. Their recent strength has propelled the broad market to a series of new highs in spite of what has been weaker breadth outside of this space.

&gt; In the chart below, we take a closer look at the relative performance of the four largest stocks versus the S&amp;P 500 over the past year. Alphabet (GOOGL) has performed the best versus the S&amp;P 500 of the four names shown and is at one-year highs. Apple (AAPL) outperformed the S&amp;P significantly in 2020 but gave it all back from late January through May. Since June, however, Apple has been on a tear versus the market. Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon (AMZN) are both still underperforming the S&amp;P over the last twelve months, but they have made solid moves higher since June.

&gt; # Value (VLUE) Giving Way To Quality (QUAL)

&gt; In last night's Closer, we noted how until February the Momentum factor (MTUM) was keeping up with Value (VLUE), but it has since given up ground as VLUE, even after stumbling of late, remains the clear top performer of the four factor-based ETFs from MSCI. On a total return basis, VLUE has gained 45.42% over the past year which is roughly 7 percentage points more than the next best performer: the Quality ETF (QUAL). Granted, that return was even stronger at 51.49% at the high on June 4th. With VLUE's outperformance having wavered over the past month, QUAL has been gaining ground. Additionally, although QUAL has underperformed, alongside Minimum Volatility (USVM) there has been a much less 'exciting' and steady grind higher than VLUE or Momentum (MTUM).

&gt; # Diverging Breadth and Frothy Sentiment

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/a734b9d2b4777766bd113a28906be098/89796090ee48d63e-e2/s500x750/d6b685fd5371e36c3cb35b75d0907fd4f5a9f09a.jpg))**

&gt; Today’s selloff did not catch the Advance/Decline Line off guard. As you can see in the chart above, as the S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ logged minor new highs yesterday and DJIA did last Friday, market breadth has been diverging. NYSE Composite and S&amp;P 500 breadth have flat-lined over the past week while Russell 2000 and NASDAQ breadth turned clearly lower. This indicates a market running out of gas as advancing issues are unable to outpace decliners and in the case of the NAS and R2K decliners have been beating out advancers over the past week.

&gt; This bad breadth scenario comes at the outset of the seasonally weakest time of the year from mid-July through October – AKA the “Worst Four Months.” In addition, bullish sentiment had reached dangerous levels in the face of a dearth of bears. The chart below courtesy of the venerable Investors Intelligence U.S. Advisors Sentiment Report shows the difference of the Bullish Advisors % less the Bearish Advisors %. When this gets above 40 it’s a warning sign and with 60.8% Bulls and 15.5% bears the difference is now 45.3%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/713d20e83eb1f1b1223cebead8093162/89796090ee48d63e-f9/s500x750/44da67099273196331f448ae52d69bf3bd3f537d.jpg))**

&gt; The weekly CBOE Equity-Only Put/Call ratio tracked in Barron’s “Market Lab that we have followed for years, has also reached extremely complacent levels lately. Put/Call retreated from the modest fear level of 0.59 at the May lows back down to 0.41 the first two weeks of June and logging 0.43 and 0.44 the past two weeks. We have been getting defensive and in a neutral posture since our April 22 Best Six Months Seasonal MACD Sell Signal for S&amp;P 500 and DJIA and have been preparing for our MACD Sell Signal for NASDAQ’s Best 8 Months which appears imminent.

&gt; # Value Has Given Up The Ghost

&gt; In the last few months of 2020 and throughout 2021, the S&amp;P 500 Value ETF (IVE) was consistently outperforming its growth counterpart (IVW). Since its most recent high in early June, though, IVE has given up the ghost falling 2.5%. Although not a dramatic decline, IVE's drop has coincided with a rally of 7.3% in IVW and an even larger 12.5% rally off the May 12th lows.

&gt; With growth having gained so much ground on value, on Tuesday, IVW's year-to-date performance actually moved above that of IVE. That has continued to be the case through the rest of the week as IVW is currently outperforming IVE on a year-to-date basis by almost a full percentage point. Additionally, looking at the past year's relative strength between the two ETFs, the recent divergence in performance has resulted in relative strength reverting back to zero meaning growth and value have roughly performed in line with one another over the one year span.

&gt; # Russell 2,000 (IWM) No Longer in Favor in Q2

&gt; The final quarter of 2020 and the first quarter of this year saw small caps come back into favor as the Russell 2,000 consistently outperformed the S&amp;P 500 during that stretch. From the late September test of its 200-DMA to the mid-March highs, the Russell 2,000 rose rallied around 65% versus the S&amp;P 500's gain which was less than half of that. As such, the ratio of the two indices shown below, and highlighted in last night's Closer, ripped higher. That outperformance has been absent over the past quarter though. In the second half of March, the ratio peaked then made a sharp reversal lower. Throughout Q2 and continuing into Q3, the ratio has continued to trend lower as the Russell 2,000 has trended sideways, hovering around its 50-DMA.

stocks,"**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, July 9, 2021**

The stock market pulled a remarkable turnaround today, shaking off yesterday’s declines with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) rocketing to another record intraday high, led by the financial and energy sectors, which had been lagging as of late and continued strength in mega-cap tech stocks. It seems that after a brief flare-up of concerns regarding the coronavirus delta variant and a potential acceleration of the timeline to taper quantitative easing in the US, fears have greatly tempered. At the time of writing, the Dow Jones (DIA) rose 1.27% while the Nasdaq (QQQ) rose 0.6% and is very slightly below it’s all-time high. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, led the day, rising more than 2%.

In recent weeks, market participants are increasingly trying to gauge if the surge we are seeing in the more contagious coronavirus delta variant will weigh on global growth rates. Yesterday, it seems concerns came to a head after the Japanese government made a last minute announcement that a state of emergency would be re-instituted across Tokyo and that all events would take place behind closed doors, with no spectators, walking back an earlier decision to allow locals to attend the games. The state of emergency will begin on Monday and run through Aug. 22, while the games are scheduled from July 23 to Aug. 8. On Wednesday, 16 days before the Opening Ceremony, the [Tokyo Metropolitan Government reported 920 COVID cases](https://stopcovid19.metro.tokyo.lg.jp/en), over 200 more than any other single-day total since May. On Thursday, it reported 896, the second-highest count since May. Other countries, like India and Brazil, are also dealing with an extremely worrying surge of cases. Even in the US, where roughly 50% of those eligible are fully vaccinated, the country is seeing a small surge in cases recently, with the delta variant accounting for 51.7% of all new infections, according to the CDC. According to reports, as of yesterday, only 16.8% of the Japanese population was vaccinated against the virus. 

In other news, in another move that raised concerns about the global growth rate, China’s central bank signalled it will be cutting the amount of cash that banks must hold in reserve, a move that suggests the economic recovery in China may be slowing down. The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) will reduce the reserve requirement ratio by 0.5 percentage points for most banks, according to a [statement](http://www.pbc.gov.cn/goutongjiaoliu/113456/113469/4287599/index.html) published Friday. That will unleash about 1 trillion yuan ($154 billion) of long-term liquidity into the economy and will be effective on July 15, the central bank said. The reduction was signaled earlier this week, when the State Council, China’s equivalent of a cabinet, hinted the central bank would make more liquidity available to banks so they could lend to smaller firms hurt by rising costs. The timing and magnitude of the move, coming a week before second-quarter growth data, suggests worries about the economy’s outlook and was a decisive shift away from policy tightening, which most, if not all, recovering economies are pursuing.

Ken Cheung, Chief Asian Foreign Exchange Strategist at Mizuho, said “The PBOC came in broader and sooner than expected, highlighting the policy urgency to support the Chinese economy. Such firm easing measures could further fuel concern over China’s growth outlook in the second half as well as the upcoming Q2 GDP figures in the coming week”. Just to put into more familiar terms, this would be like if the Federal Reserve suddenly turned around and said rather than discussing tapering quantitative easing, it would instead propose pumping more money into the economy.

While these global concerns did jitter the market yesterday, the impressive recovery in US equities underscores the remarkable strength of its economy, as the country continues reopening thanks to effective distribution of the vaccine, with 48% of the population fully vaccinated, according to the CDC. In my opinion, while the delta variant does pose a risk to global growth rates, and the market may react negatively to headlines about it, the foundations of the recovery in the US (i.e nation-wide reopening measures, a rapidly improving labor market, record earnings from companies, and a high level of savings among Americans) are very strong and will continue to underpin a bull market here. 

**Highlights** 

* The recent sell-off in crude oil recovered, with the West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures settling higher by 2.2% to $74.56 per barrel at the time of writing.
* Apple (AAPL), the largest company in the world, reached a new all-time high today. 
* President Biden is expected to sign an executive agreement ordering the Federal Trade Commission to limit or ban noncompete agreements, unnecessary occupational licenses, and revise guidance for sharing wage information between the HR department and workers and other employers. 
* Tesla (TSLA), Brookfield Asset Management (BAM) said Friday they would work together on a new initiative to create the nation's most sustainable residential community. The companies said the provisionally named SunHouse at Easton Park in Austin, Texas, would be the first Tesla Solar neighborhood.
* On Monday, a trial will kick off in the Court of Chancery in Wilmington, Delaware between Elon Musk and shareholders. The plaintiffs alleged that Musk used his control at Tesla to force the company to buy SolarCity for $2.6 billion in order to protect his investment in the company from bankruptcy and want Musk to pay that money back to Tesla. IMO seems a little weird to me to sue about this given that SolarCity has proven to be a good acquisition for Tesla.
* Apple (AAPL) is reportedly in early talks with the NFL to buy the rights to stream Sunday Night games for their streaming service. A while ago, Amazon (AMZN) bought the right to stream Thursday NFL games for Prime Video. 
* Marvel’s “Black Widow, opened in theaters last night and is expected to be the biggest opening since 2019, with the film projected to bring around $80 million domestically. This is huge and a sign that Americans' appetite to go to movie-theaters is very real. Personally, I’m going to go watch in the theaters this weekend. 
* Foxconn, a well known supplier for Apple, is discussing plans with Fisker (FSR) to open a factory to build EV’s in Wisconsin. In a statement, the company said, “Foxconn has engaged the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation (WEDC) to discuss the company's plans for electric vehicle manufacturing. Foxconn is optimistic about our partnership with WEDC and looks forward to ongoing discussions

stocks,"Of these, about 80% have little or no revenue, and have massive accumulated deficits offset by large issues equity (The companies lose money YoY, and to stay afloat they sell more and more shares each year).  This really destroys shareholder value, and makes these companies toxic.  Most of these companies are mining, materials or exploration companies by category, but in reality they just own a plot of land they believe has some resource buried deep in it.  I read through the annual reports for about ten of these companies.  The reports are very simple, and it is clear that they have deep issues in operations and financials.

There are a number of SP\*C like companies that offer little promise.  They claim that they are a resource or manufacturing company - but looking deep into their operations the words ""planned manufacturing"" or ""future acquisitions"" are prevalent in any discussion about operations or assets.  These companies have nothing going on.  They may have some ideas or plans, some capital to carry out these plans, but they don't actually own or do anything.  There are hundreds of these companies.

There are a few promising small cap companies, and more promising mid to large cap companies.  I have tabulated 110 companies that have some promise or have good current operations.  These are all my opinion, and I haven't considered at all any of the financial states of these companies - I have only read a blurb about what the company does, and looked at the size and current earnings in some cases.  Some may have great operations, some may be horribly unprofitable, but all are distinguished as doing something other than thinking about mining or buying real estate.

it did not get much traction as I expected, but the small indications i did get made me look farther into the stock. 

quick tl;dr, I'm following the stock SG ETC WTI +2x Daily Leveraged Collateralized (OIL2L.MI) that had a 1 to 100 grouping over 2020 to correct the dip when oil went below 0. the future was emitted in 2017 and has a buy back clause with deadline 2047. 

The deadline of the contract for this Future is 2047 at whatever price per barrel leveraged by two is on the date of expiry. 

I was wondering, as I bought the stock previous to the grouping of the stock, if I were to hold until 2047 and bring the contract to its end of term, would the stock buy back have to be at 100 times the value I bought the contract for? Have I been robbed of 100 times the profit I should make if this is not the case?

Thank you for any advice anyone has to offer,

stocks,"There is another thread going right now about how outrageous it is for certain brands to be included in certain ESG funds. It seems like the majority of folks are saying, 'Yeah, ESG is bullshit corporate PR and fuck it all.'

When it comes to individual corporations self-reporting on their 'ESG metrics', yes, they obviously are going to make themselves seem like god's gift to the human race, while they continue to destroy the planet. And in that regard certain aspects of ESG reporting can be a load of crap.

But that *does not* diminish the power of true ESG mutual funds and of ESG investing in general.

Just like when you are choosing any stock or ETF, you *must* research what they hold, why, the hold it and who they (the funds) are.

I've been investing the socially responsible mutual funds/ETFs since 2012 - when those funds were just in a text list on some 90's-era website. Even then, you look up the fund, you look at their holdings, you read their statement, and you figure out if their approach fits with what you believe in.

At that time ESG had a sort of Protestant bent to it - most the funds were 'no guns, tobacco, gambling, or alcohol'. Well, I honestly don't care about any of that shit. I'm in it for the planet, so I found two funds that I liked:

Green Century and Walden.

https://www.greencentury.com/

https://www.bostontrustwalden.com/investment-services/mutual-funds/

And here's what I liked about them: they don't just invest in companies that are already green, they use their capital to push companies to become *more green*. Every quarter you get a little pamphlet in the mail talking about specific things that they have encouraged companies to do.

Example: https://www.greencentury.com/protecting-the-bees-that-play-a-vital-role-as-pollinators/

*That* is how an ESG fund can be incredibly effective.

And so while *some* ESG funds may not align with your values, ESG is not a catchall. It simply means

Environment - impact on climate

Social - how do their treat their workers, community

Governance - what does their power structure look like

One time I thought 'Oh, I'll invest in this ETF that only holds female-run corporations', well, it's a nice thought, but then I realized I was holding a bunch of shitty chemical companies that I despise. So, that investment concept didn't work for me. Many ESG ETFs might have criteria that don't align with what is important to you, but you've got to do the research before you give up on fighting for change with your money.

So anyways, I encourage people *not* to just shit on ESGs, but to work to utilize the power of funds to push corporations to act more responsibly. It is hugely powerful for massive numbers of people to amass massive quantities of money and leverage that money for good.

So for anyone still curious where they can screen for ESGs that they might actually *like* rather than just be disenfranchised by, maybe take a look at the this website, which breaks funds down by their focus - and go from there:

https://charts.ussif.org/mfpc/

And I'll say it before anyone else does - the actively managed funds' expense ratios are generally higher than your computer-managed index ETFs, but in my opinion it's money well spent. These people are trying to save the planet from inside the system and they can take a cut of the money they make me in the process.","ESG investing is NOT bullshit, here's why",1625850212

stocks,"Chinese stocks have been getting more heat recently and have dropped further, but they've maintained their technical levels of support which means that we have yet another buying opportunity. These are not short-term plays, but are very attractive IMO.

These are my top 5 Chinese stocks to buy right now. All five are cheap, have a good growth outlook and have 40%+ upside.

1. $BABA - leader in Chinese ecommerce (its Taobao and Tmall account for 58% of the $1.8 Trillion Chinese ecommerce market) and the biggest cloud solutions provider in China
2. $BIDU - the most used search engine in China - 80% of all searches and 93% of all mobile searches! Also has cloud, AI and driverless cars business plus a number of other smaller initiatives. For example, Baidu's AI speaker is the most purchased one on the Chinese market
3. $DOYU and HUYA (HUYA is not on eToro) - the two companies account for 80% of the Chinese streaming market which is expected to grow 32% next year! Both are extremely cheap, especially DOYU
4. $QFIN - rapidly growing consumer lending business which was NOT affected by last year's Chinese financial regulations unlike virtually all of its competitors! It dropped 25% yesterday after its core product, the 360 IOU app, was delisted from app stores in China due to data safety regulations, but I think that the company can deal with this quickly and come back on top. It was trading for $44 a few weeks ago so it could skyrocket again although we may have to wait until its next earnings report in \~45 days or so

$KC is an honourable mention - the company is China's largest independent cloud solutions provider (much tinier than Alibaba, but it's growing fast) and it's also been on a downward trend for a while, but has a lot of potential. It's one to watch although I don't know if you should be buying it right now.

What do you think about investing in China? I know a lot of people are polarised - they are either excited about it or strongly opposed.

stocks,"Lyft is five times cheaper to acquire than Uber. It has 35% of ridesharing marketshare in America and is rapidly growing in Canada—two of Amazon's biggest market. 



Currently, no major Western ridesharing platform is profitable. That's because it takes a ton of costly promotions and subsidies on both the rider and driver sides to grow a ridesharing platform. 



Amazon, however, could substantially reduce the high cost of new rider acquisition by just offering their over 100 million Prime members a discount for using Lyft over Uber. This would shift marketshare overnight. 



Then, on the driver side, Lyft drivers could be doing last mile order fulfillment for Prime Now and Amazon Restaurant when ride demand is low—effectively increasing driver wages through removing time spent waiting for a new passenger while also lowering Amazon's fulfillment costs. 



The operational efficiencies that come from owning both commerce and ridesharing would allow Amazon to become the most valuable company in the world.

stocks,"Digital payments processor Stripe Inc, the most valuable U.S. technology startup, has taken its first major step toward a stock market debut by hiring a law firm to help with preparations, according to people familiar with the matter.

The 11-year-old company, which was valued by investors at $95 billion in a fundraising round in March, has sat out this year's red-hot market for initial public offerings (IPOs), using private tender offers to allow some of its existing investors and employees to cash out their holdings.

Remaining private has enabled Stripe to keep such financial details as revenue and profitability under wraps. Yet this has also deprived it of using its shares as a publicly traded currency to help finance acquisitions and to incentivize employees.

Stripe has tapped Cleary Gottlieb Steen &amp; Hamilton LLP as a legal adviser on its early-stage listing preparations, the sources said. There has been no decision on the timing of the stock market debut, and the next step would be the hiring of investment banks later this year, the sources added. The listing would be unlikely to happen this year, two of the sources said.

Stripe is considering going public through a direct listing, rather than a traditional IPO, because it does not need to raise money, said two of the sources, cautioning that those plans could change.

 Founded in 2010 by Irish brothers Patrick and John Collison, Stripe processes hundreds of billions of dollars in transactions every year for millions of businesses worldwide. Its list of clients includes Alphabet Inc's Google, Uber Technologies Inc, Amazon.com Inc and Zoom Video Communications Inc. Early investors Elon Musk, Peter Thiel and Google’s venture capital arm.

Stripe's breakneck growth could result in it challenging Chinese technology giants Ant Group and ByteDance, whose valuations are close to $200 billion, for the title of world's most valuable startup by the time it goes public.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

stocks," I've seen a few comments around recently like ""earnings were great, why did the stock tank"", ""omg what happened, someone please explain why \_\_\_\_ just skyrocketed on no news"".

I could say ""well, it was baked in / overvalued in the first place and results were still below the higher expectations"" or ""there's some game changing development that's not public yet"", but regardless of whether those statements are right or wrong - the explanation / ""valuation"" sometimes...might not matter.

The stock market is just a giant game of chicken between bulls and bears. Revenue, earnings, news, etc. can just be seen as helpful hints (and I do believe material changes in a business should matter), but ultimately a stock's price comes down to which side has more conviction/money behind it. I think the developments with meme stocks and PND's have made this more apparent.

When a stock goes down, more money simply decided to sell/short it and vice versa (maybe it's moving in sympathy with the broader market or it's industry). Instead of thinking revenue/earnings/news drives the stock price, just think of the information as tools players can use in order to convince more people to buy/sell a stock.

I guess what I'm saying is...everything is manipulation. Try not to panic, learn to use it to your advantage. If I have conviction in my long and short plays (and if nothing material changes my thesis - always good to adapt if it does), the easy thing to do is just hold / buy the dips / roll. Sometimes I'll hedge, sometimes I'll trade the momentum / sentiment.

Hi Michelle,

 

Thank you for writing in!  I'm happy to share the details of the stock merger with you.

 

First, please know that all shareholders of this stock were affected by this corporate action. 

 

On 02/05/2021 Aevi Genomic Medicine (GNMX) performed a stock merger. Shareholders will receive 0.0334 shares of CERC for every 1 share of GNMX previously held. 

 

Your 11 shares of GNMX became 0.367 of a share of CERC.  This remaining 0.367 shares automatically converted to cash in the amount of $1.37 on 02/14/2021.

You also received 11 GNMX^ rights which will pay additional cash if the company hits certain milestones.

 

Fractional shares resulting from the merger are usually paid in cash to your Robinhood account at a later date, typically 1-2 weeks after the effective merger date.

 

When a company performs a corporate action such as a dividend payment, stock split, or merger, we do our best to accurately process the event in a timely manner. 

 

Please note that the specific instructions and terms of the corporate action are actually determined by the issuing company, not Robinhood or any other brokerage firm.

 

We cannot speak on behalf of the company’s decision to perform the corporate action, but if you'd like to learn more about the reasons behind a corporate action, you're encouraged to reach out to the issuer's investor relations hotline

stocks,"First post here.  I've been on Reddit since Feb. 1st though when I bought shares of $AMC. Yes my profile says only 7 days old but that's because I had to make my handle anonymous for work purposes.  Anyways, I finally decided to do some fundamental DD the movie industry and subsequently $AMC.  What inspired me to do this was to research that ""myths"" that the movie industry is dieing and that $AMC's fundamental value is $5.  I decided not to take it at face value anymore and do the research. You won't believe what I uncovered.  First, the myth we hear that people aren't attending movies anymore is simply not true. Box Office Revenue for North America, revenue has increased from 2008 at 9 Billion to 11 Billion in 2019.
https://www.statista.com/statistics/187069/north-american-box-office-gross-revenue-since-1980/
 I can hear the haters and Bears now, but movie theaters make their money on concessions not tickets!  This is not true and another myth. While it's true theatres make more off of concessions, 85%, they still make money off tickets, 40%.
https://www.google.com/search?q=do+movie+theaters+make+money+from+ticket+sales&amp;oq=do+mov&amp;aqs=chrome.1.69i57j35i39j0l2j69i60.5927j0j7&amp;client=ms-android-mpcs-us-revc&amp;sourceid=chrome-mobile&amp;ie=UTF-8
In the US alone concessions accounted for an additional 5.7 Billion in Revenue.
https://www.google.com/search?q=how+much+revenue+did+movie+theaters+make+in+north+america&amp;oq=how+much+r&amp;aqs=chrome.1.69i57j35i39l2j0j0i131i433.4972j0j7&amp;client=ms-android-mpcs-us-revc&amp;sourceid=chrome-mobile&amp;ie=UTF-8
That means the movie industry is North America alone is worth approximately 17 Billion. It's not going anywhere. Additionally, let's not forget, giants like $AMC are worldwide, as those in Europe will attest to, so this revenue figure is actually larger.  Why didn't I include it? Because it's more work and I'm not getting paid.
So now that we know that the movie industry is a viable business, let's talk about $AMC.  $AMC is the leader in North America with 8043 screens, The only companies close to $AMC are Regal and possibly Cinemark. 
https://www.statista.com/statistics/188565/north-american-movie-theater-circuits-by-number-of-screens/
After that it's quite a drop, $AMC could purchase some of these smaller chains, as they have financially struggled as well due to the pandemic, and are debt ridden too, but unlike $AMC that had Apes to bail it out, these smaller chain remain in precarious financial situations. A potential opportunity for AMC to increase its market share. Indeed, CEO Adam Aron has already done this with the purchase of Fitchburg.  
https://www.google.com/amp/s/madison.com/ct/writers/rob-thomas/amc-buys-back-fitchburg-movie-theater-plans-to-reopen-in-june/article_235f52b1-93b4-5858-9978-8b5ebc8b9e9d.amp.html
But you need revenue to aquire new theatres, how does that look for $AMC?  I was surprised to discover in doing the DD that $AMC had an all time revenue high for the US at 5.7 Billion in 2019.  This is why it's good to do the DD.  Furthermore, AMC hit an ATH in 2018 with with 359 million attendees Worldwide.  2019 showed it was no fluke with 356 million attendees Worldwide. 
""Total attendance at AMC Theatres worldwide reached record levels in 2018, with over 359 million attendees, though this figure dropped to 356 million in 2019. The company also announced all-time high revenue of over 5.47 billion U.S. dollars for the latter year.""
https://www.statista.com/statistics/188565/north-american-movie-theater-circuits-by-number-of-screens/
Thus the future is promising once we are thoroughly out of the pandemic.  So what about now?  Well shockingly somehow the Box Office Revenue is down  37% from last year. Likely because the Country opened up for a part of 2020 before shutting back down again in 2021.
https://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/364822/movie-business-expects-us-box-office-recovery.html
What does that mean? Well with everything open now I believe the movie industry is in for a lucrative July and August.  Black Widow opening this weekend will be a good barometer to see if the movie industry has fully recovered and if it can makeup the gap from last year.  Earnings report for $AMC is due August 3rd. Now could be the time to get in if you think the Earnings report will be positive and serve as a catalyst to drive the price up.",Is the movie industry really dieing?

&amp;#x200B;

The Teslas in the competition -- a Model S, a [Model 3](http://www.cnn.com/2021/06/30/business/tesla-model-3-consumer-reports-top-pick/index.html) and a Model Y -- were hampered by quality problems.

At one point, the cruise control system on the Tesla Model Y abruptly stopped working with no warning, said Sharon Silke Carty, Car and Driver's editor-in-chief, in an interview with CNN Business.

""All of a sudden I was going 30 in the middle of the highway,"" she said.

The touchscreen system, which is critical because it operates most of the Tesla's controls, stopped working not long after the car arrived for testing, the review said. Car and Driver also noted poor fits between parts and a ""grating squeak"" from the rear seat.

The Model 3 had a large gap around the hood, Car and Driver noted. Another Tesla they tested, [the Model S](https://www.cnn.com/2021/06/21/success/tesla-model-s-plaid-motortrend/index.html), only had 3,600 miles on it but its front motor failed.

It's looking like this rumor is starting to gain traction. The 20B deal is clarified here by Reuters' sources as being in the form of a $90-100 per share buyout, representing a 50% premium over the current price.

13-day upward trend is pretty strong with some crazy pre-market action a few days back, and relative volume has been strong. It's possible we're seeing a ramp up here - whether it'll hit 90$ or go above before settling will be something to see. What I've seen building up to buyouts that I've seen is just the same as this, a ramp up coming to a breakout to the proposed deal price, then it plateaus. Obviously, the trend may be different here and I'm curious about your guys' experience with these events. 

I think if it does see momentum continuing to build, it could be a very good call opportunity as well.

Stocks dipped across the board today, putting a stop to the recent record-setting rally that has seen both the Nasdaq (QQQ) and S&amp;P 500 (SPY) reach countless fresh intraday highs in the last six weeks or so. The SPY and Dow Jones (DIA) both fell roughly 0.9% while the tech-heavy QQQ fared slightly better, closing 0.65% down. It seems there a few differing factors that contributed to the drop today, including but not limited to, (1) rising coronavirus fears outside of the US due to the highly contagious Delta variant, (2) the Fed’s June Meeting Minutes, which showed members are increasingly talking about accelerating the timeline to taper quantitative easing, (3) a disappointing weekly unemployment report, and (4) general profit-taking after such a monster rally in the market. In positive news, the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield sank for the fourth straight day, hovering around a multi-month low at 1.29%, a sign that inflation fears are further tapering. 

In a sign of rising concerns over the highly contagious coronavirus delta variant, the Japanese made a last minute announcement that a state of emergency would be re-instituted across Tokyo and that all events would take place behind closed doors, with no spectators, walking back an earlier decision to allow locals to attend the games. On Wednesday, 16 days before the Opening Ceremony, the [Tokyo Metropolitan Government reported 920 COVID cases](https://stopcovid19.metro.tokyo.lg.jp/en), over 200 more than any other single-day total since May. On Thursday, it reported 896, the second-highest count since May. Other countries, like India and Brazil, are also dealing with an extremely worrying surge of cases. Even in the US, where roughly 50% of those eligible are fully vaccinated, the country is seeing a small surge in cases recently, with the delta variant accounting for 51.7% of all new infections. 

Yesterday, the Federal Reserve released the June Meeting minutes, which are notes about what was discussed in the latest meeting, which helps market participants decipher that path forward for monetary policy and possible timelines for any adjustments. The Fed said the economic recovery “was generally seen as not having yet been met”, but said they are ready to act if inflationary pressures indeed begin to materialize. The minutes said, “Participants generally judged that, as a matter of prudent planning, it was important to be well positioned to reduce the pace of asset purchases, if appropriate, in response to unexpected economic developments, including faster-than anticipated progress toward the Committee’s goals or the emergence of risks that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals”. This is not surprising, as I have been saying for weeks now, as the pace of economic recovery improves, quantitative easing, or the purchase of government bonds in order to inject money into the economy, is always the first policy to be tapered. I am not worried about the tapering of quantitative easing and encourage everyone to read up about the 2013 Taper Tantrum, which happened when the Fed announced QE would be tapered since the economy had largely recovered from the 2008 crisis by then.

In other news, after a strong run of outperformance in reports about the labor market, the most recent weekly unemployment report showed new jobless claims unexpectedly tick higher. According to the Department of Labor, there were 373,000 new jobless claims filed last week, higher than the 350,000 expected. While it is slightly disappointing, jobless claims in the US have been continuously declining for months, a sign that the labor market continues to improve as the US continues to reopen.

Ian Shepherdson, Chief Economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics said, “The consensus ignored the tendency for unadjusted claims to rise in weeks when July 4 falls on a Sunday, so the risk was always to the upside. But this is noise, not signal. The seasonal adjustments are struggling simultaneously with the July 4 holiday period and the annual automakers’ retooling shutdowns, which can make the headline numbers even more volatile than usual. The noise will persist through late July, but we have no doubt that the underlying trend will remain downwards."" I agree and remain encouraged by the pace of recovery in the labor market. 

Another potential explanation for today’s pullback, coupled with the other reasons listed, may be general profit taking after such a monster run by the broader market. Since mid-May, the Nasdaq and SPY are up 12.3% and 6% respectively, a great run by any judgement. Nothing ever goes straight up, sometimes dips are needed for the market to recharge for another move higher. 

Looking ahead, market participants are waiting for Q2 earnings season, which is set to kick off next week with big banks reporting. 

**Highlights**

* The Labor Department's monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Summary showed U.S. job openings increased to 9.209 million in May. This followed a downwardly revised 9.193 million in April, which was brought down from the 9.286 million previously reported
* U.S. mortgage applications declined for a second straight week last week, declining to the lowest level in a year-and-a-half as home price growth and low housing inventories weighed further on purchasing activity. 
* The NFL and Twitter (TWTR) are extending a media partnership that will leverage Twitter Spaces, the social-media network's live-audio feature. The NFL says it has more than 20 Spaces sessions planned for the upcoming season; they will include participation from players and other NFL personalities. Other aspects of the partnership will include postings of curated videos, Twitter polls and other content.
* Airbus delivered 297 airplanes in the first half of the year after a surge of handover activity in June, the European planemaker said on Thursday. US-rival Boeing (BA), on the other hand, has more orders in the books for planes but only managed to deliver 111 planes so far this year.
* Tesla (TSLA) introduced a cheaper version of the Model Y in China, as the company is facing increased pressure from Chinese regulators and local competitors. 
* Beyond Meat (BYND) is expanding its product portfolio by launching plant-based chicken-tenders.

\#\*\*LET US BEGIN\*\*

In the wake of the Texas power outages due to the inadequacy of ERCOT to efficiently maintain power during severe weather conditions, the state of the resin manufacturing industry has been thrown into disarray. A large quantity of domestic resin production in the United States is centered around the gulf coast, fueled by the oil fields in the Midwestern South. This decrease in production has resulted in turmoil within the resin-based stock market, as many tickers hit by the industrial decline which coincided with the latter half of these outages have struggled greatly. Between June 8th and the date of this writing (June 25th), LyondellBasell (NYSE: LYB) fell 10.00%, and Danimer Scientific Inc. (NYSE: DNMR) fell 13.83%. In this, I detail an analysis on both stocks, along with my thoughts on what the recovery of the resin industry will look like.  


\##**LyondellBasell Industries N.V., the Case for a Strong Resin Resurgence**

*LyondellBasell Industries* (NYSE: LYB) is, as of 2018, the [third largest independent chemical manufacturer in the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_chemical_producers), with a particular focus on polyethylene production. Formed in 2007 through the purchase and subsequent merging of the Lyondell Chemical Company into Basell Polyolefins. [They are the worlds largest licensor of polyolefin technology](https://www.lyondellbasell.com/en/products-technology/technology/), and have the majority of their plastic resin producing facilities in the United States based in Texas, with the largest being located in Channelview, TX, just outside of Houston.

  
 [Polyethylene is the worlds most produced type of plastic](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/The-six-most-common-plastic-polymers-produced-worldwide-in-2012-Plastic-Europe-2013_tbl1_273089847), coming in Low-Density (LDPE), Linear Low-Density (LLDPE), and high-density (HDPE) variations. It is also the most used type of plastic in [packaging, a plastics industry consumes up to 40% of the plastic production worldwide.](https://www.mdpi.com/2313-4321/3/1/1/htm)

Polyethylene, especially low-density polyethylene, is perfect for many packaging uses. It is a lightweight, clear, destructible material that is food safe, nonreactive with most chemical compounds, and has a melt temperature just above 105 Celsius. [With the proper additives, LDPE can also be made static resistant.](https://brentwoodplastics.com/anti-static#:~:text=There%20are%20four%20basic%20classes%20of%20anti%2Dstats%20for%20LDPE%20film%3A&amp;text=GMS%2C%20or%20glycerol%20mono%2Dstearate,and%20usefulness%20in%20dry%20environments.) This makes it ideal for wrapping electronic products and components that are sensitive to static electricity.

As COVID-19’s effect on the economy wanes, there has been a significant increase in consumer spending. [According to the United States Bureau of Economic Analysis, consumer spending has nearly reached pre-lockdown levels.](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/consumer-spending)

&amp;#x200B;

With the influx of stimulus money into the public, the spending of consumers has seen a dramatic recovery. This significant increase of products being sold requires a large amount of plastic to package, plastic that is created using resin that LyondellBasell manufactures and licenses. A difficulty to create resin does not necessarily coincide with a drop in profitability. Instead, a discrepancy has been created. A high demand for LDPE fueled by consumer spending, along with a low supply caused by production hampering along the Gulf Coast is unlikely to result in a devaluation of the material, but instead a significant increase in the price of the resin per pound. **LyondellBasell is perfectly poised to take advantage of this and profit significantly during the second quarter, as a scarcity in resin allows them to charge premium prices without having to worry about risking their customers**. The control that resin manufacturers now have over the market assures the health of said manufacturers. LDPE is not just a commodity; it is a necessity. Therefore, the demand of LDPE is assured, and the pricing will simply move to reflect the lucrative industry packaging plastics has become in recent months.   


\##**Danimer Scientific Incorporated, the Case Against a New Contender**

*Danimer Scientific Incorporated* (NYSE: DNMR) is a corporation centered around the production and manufacturing of bioplastics and biodegradable polymers. Founded in 2004 and debuting on the NYSE in December of 2020. Their flagship product, Nodax, is a polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) with a claimed biodegradation time of as little as two months. Produced on a 1:1 ratio through the fermentation of canola oil with relevant microorganisms, Nodax seems to be poised to take over the plastics market. Nodax is a plastic with thermal properties that can stretch between Low-density and High-density Polyethylene, as well as having a tensile strength located right between the two. Through its mechanical properties and its range of uses, Nodax could have the potential to replace the wasteful packaging industry with a material that can biodegrade without harming the environment, and without sacrificing the properties that make petroleum-based polymers attractive for such uses. That being said, the company still has a long way to go before it can successfully produce a relevant amount of Nodax to fulfill the market demand for an acceptable environmentally friendly replacement to petroleum-based polymers. Danimer still has a long way to go before it could possibly benefit from a wounded resin industry, including issues with properly handling this new waste and also supplying for its production.

The first bit of skepticism comes from their claims of the biodegradability of their plastic. [The claim that Nodax is capable of completely degrading within two months is based on perfect conditions](https://www.wsj.com/articles/plastic-straws-that-quickly-biodegrade-in-the-ocean-not-quite-scientists-say-11616238001#:~:text=Created%20with%20sketchtool.,-Plastic%3A%20The%20Scourge&amp;text=At%20some%20ocean%20temperatures%2C%20Nodax,bottles%20could%20take%20even%20longer.), which is not realistic. Their conditions require microorganisms producing polymerase which can break down Nodax, and these microorganisms are not ubiquitous at all corners of our lives. [In 60% of cases, plastic waste ends up in landfills instead of being recycled](https://www.unep.org/interactive/beat-plastic-pollution/). The assumption that landfills will possess the correct microorganisms to degrade these plastics is questionable, as [many landfills are specifically designed to limit the decomposition of inner components.](https://highcountryconservation.org/2019/07/16/ask-eartha-why-we-dont-want-our-trash-to-break-down-in-the-landfill/) While this is great overall, as it reduces methane gases being released into our atmosphere, this is devastating for the proposition of a biodegradable plastic. While one could always assume that we should just make sure that these bioplastics reach their end of life in controlled environments, the world’s previously mentioned issue with ensuring plastics are recycled calls into question the viability of trying to create foolproof systems to make sure that Nodax end up where it should.

  
 In addition, the production of Nodax requires an extreme amount of growth in canola related agriculture. Nodax is produced using canola/rapeseed oil at about a 1:1 ratio. [In 2015, the world consumed around 380 million tons of plastics per annum.](https://ourworldindata.org/plastic-pollution#how-much-plastic-does-the-world-produce) 

Of that, around [40% or 152 million tons are used in packaging.](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/plastics-facts-infographics-ocean-pollution#:~:text=CALIFORNIA%2C%20SANTA%20BARBARA-,40%20percent%20of%20plastic%20produced%20is%20packaging,just%20once%20and%20then%20discarded.) The majority of these packaging plastics are made of ethylene based polymers or polypropylene, both of which are mostly petroleum-based. [Current canola/rapeseed production worldwide comes out to about 27.3 million tons per year.](https://www.statista.com/statistics/263930/worldwide-production-of-rapeseed-by-country/) In addition to this, the [average production of canola/rapeseed oil per acre is 1,840 pounds](https://www.agmrc.org/commodities-products/grains-oilseeds/rapeseed#:~:text=its%20production%20properties.-,Production,pounds%20per%20acre%20in%202016.), or .831 metric tons. Therefore, to replace traditional packaging polymers, canola/rapeseed agricultural output would have to increase 5.56 times over to meet the demand. With such a large increase of agricultural expansion, this could have severe impacts on the environment. With current acreage on canola/rapeseed production, we would need 183 million acres of land to use for new farmland. [For reference the entire state of Texas in the United States is 171 million acres.](https://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/fsm8_037652.htm) An amount of farmland larger than the size of Texas would be required to replace packaging needs worldwide. The agricultural production needed just does not exist right now. Even with the current production of canola/rapeseed, this plastic could only take up 2% of the current market share for plastic resin production worldwide, assuming that they can use every drop of canola oil produced. 

Will Danimer succeed in the short term? In all likelihood, yes. The criticism of this company and their product has so far ignored the potential for extreme profits even with the limited amount they can produce. The potential for custom made packaging, as pointed out by a peer of mine, cannot be understated. [Their deals with companies like Nestle](https://www.nestle.com/media/pressreleases/allpressreleases/nestle-danimer-scientific-develop-biodegradable-water-bottle) show that huge businesses are still interested in it. What Danimer and Nodax are not, however, is a silver bullet to the packaging needs of the United States or of the world. **It is unlikely that the resurgence of the resin market, then, will affect Danimer’s revenue**. What is more likely is that speculation on the future of Nodax and its use in plastics will drive spikes in market value, and this will be followed by a period of slow and consistent growth as either the supply of the necessary materials and/or Danimer’s list of partners expands. **Danimer’s growth will be its own, and it will be as the above-mentioned problems, especially in the raw material supply needs, are resolved.**  


\#\*\*TL;DR: The resin industry will be doing great, but now is not the time to expect new contenders to make huge gains and huge amounts of customers.

With a low market cap, expansion plans during COVID recovery, and currently sitting near ATLs, I think this is a great play. Shake Shack has a cap of ~4.4B, while BurgerFi is at ~160M.

stocks,"Been reading SoFi DD's on here and WSB and, unless i'm missing something, SoFi just seems like a run-of-the-mill bank targeted for people 20-35. I personally use SoFi because at the time they had the best APR and access to all ATM for free (they don't have this policy anymore).

I don't know much about their home, college and auto loan business but i cant imagine people taking out a loan with SoFi just because they have a checking account. When i take out a loan, I'm looking at the rates first and everything else second. Convenience is nice but I'd suck it up if Chase is offering me a used car loan for 4% vs some other bank for 8%.

There are people that say Galileo is the key to SoFi, and this justifies people lumping SoFi into the fin-tech industry. But investing in SoFi because of Galileo is another issue all together, and right now, Galileo is about 1/8 of SoFi's business.

I should also say that I haven't dug deep into SoFi, but everything i've looked at so far has told me it's a bank trading like a tech company.","Calling SoFi bulls, can you tell me why SoFi isn't just a regular bank dressed up for millennials?",1625769883

In December 2020 it was [announced](https://www.astrazeneca.com/media-centre/press-releases/2020/astrazeneca-to-acquire-alexion.html) that Alexion ($ALXN) and Astrazeneca stroke a deal, where Astrazeneca would fully acquire Alexion. The deal is as follows: *""Alexion shareholders will receive* ***$60 in cash and 2.1243 AstraZeneca American Depositary Shares (ADSs)*** *(each ADS representing one-half of one (1/2) ordinary share of AstraZeneca, as evidenced by American Depositary Receipts (ADRs))* ***for each Alexion share****. Based on AstraZeneca's reference average ADR price of $54.14, this implies total consideration to Alexion shareholders of $39bn or $175 per share.  The boards of directors of both companies have unanimously approved the acquisition. Subject to receipt of regulatory clearances and approval by shareholders of both companies, the acquisition is* ***expected to close in Q3 2021****, and upon completion, Alexion shareholders will own c.15% of the combined company.""*

At the time of the announcement, the share price of $ALXN shot from $120 to $156.  In April 2021 the US [gave clearance](https://www.astrazeneca.com/media-centre/press-releases/2021/us-clearance-of-proposed-acquisition-of-alexion.html) to the deal. On May 11 2021, shareholders of Alexion [approved](https://ir.alexion.com/news-releases/news-release-details/alexion-shareholders-approve-acquisition-astrazeneca) the acquisition, and this week the EU [approved](https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/astrazeneca-s-39b-alexion-buyout-scores-eu-s-blessing-but-awaits-key-nod-from-uk) the buyout.

The Alexion shareholders now have the option to receive the stock value by receiving either 2.1243 shares of Astrazeneca -ADR- traded at the NASDAQ, or by receiving 1.06215 ordinary shares of Astrazeneca traded at the LSE.

stocks,"Some of the most common FUD I see on here is ""OMG the company executives are selling stocks! They know the company is going to tank...SELL SELL SELL!""

But this panic is from misguided investors (or people purposely trying to sew doubt), and not actually how it works at all in a lot of cases. Most people are aware that company insiders are beholden to very strict regulations regarding insider trading. In the most simple terms, they are not allowed to trade their company stock (buy shares, sell shares, execute options, anything) based on  MNPI (Material Non Public Information)...ie they can't make any moves based on any important information about the company that the public does not have.  

The rule outlining prosecution of these insider trading violations is known as SEC Rule 10b5-1. 

The inherent problem is that this rule creates somewhat of a paradox. Company insiders obviously always know more than the public, so almost any trade they make could potentially be considered an insider trade. So how do executives trade their shares without violating the rule?

To get around this risk, many company executives are typically asked to sign what are known as 10b5-1 plans. This is essentially an agreement between themselves and a brokerage firm, outlining the exact price minimums they want to sell shares at, along with the volume and frequency. These plans are typically entered BEFORE shares are even issued, or pre-IPO if its a newly public company. 

The plan does 3 things ([https://ccbjournal.com/articles/the-10b5-1-plan-what-executives-need-to-know](https://ccbjournal.com/articles/the-10b5-1-plan-what-executives-need-to-know)):

* **Specifies the number of shares to be traded, along with the price and date of the purchase or sale; or**
* **Includes a written formula, algorithm or computer program for determining the number of shares to be traded and the price and the date of the trade; or**
* **Transfers trading authority to a third party not in possession of MNPI and prohibits the insider from exercising any subsequent influence over how, when or whether to make purchases or sales.**

The executive signs the agreement...and the brokerage carries out the trades based on the pre-determined instructions.

At the bottom of form 4 filings in the ""Explanation of Responses"" section, look for a note that says something like: "" (1) The sales reported in this Form 4 were effected pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan adopted by the Reporting Person""  

If you see that note, it means that insider has a 10b5-1 plan, the sale was pre-determined well in advance, and has 0 to do with the executive's sentiment towards the company.  It is 100% normal for executives to take share profit periodically to supplement their income, especially post-IPO. 

Now, these plans aren't bulletproof, and can be modified or suspended. But if the insider has any MNPI, they can get in deep shit if they're caught doing something shady. 

Over 57% of S&amp;P companies are under such a plan, and most new IPOs I see are doing them.

Most resources explain what it is, but doesn’t really explain it on the real world practical and strategy side, how to and when someone would physically want to use such a thing, so figured any help and explanation is greatly appreciated, even if it's just explaining 1-2 of these questions. 


1. Is it ever worth it to sell an option expiring in the next 1-2 weeks or should you just sell long-term options, several months into the future? I wanted to try short-term for an experiment, but seems like the profit margins and risk is meager and much more worth it to do long-term? 

2. Is it ever worth it or even smart to sell a put option at a strike price more than the current stock price? Looks like you get much more money, but at the same time, isn't it common sense the other side will exercise it, since the price is already above the current market price, so they'd of course want to sell it back? If you sell a put option at $70, and the stock is currently $65, doesn't it make common sense, if the stock drops anything below, since it already is, they'd obviously want to exercise and sell it to me for $70 to get it back? 
3. Can you exit an option you sold by buying it back? 
4. What scenarios and why would someone ever sell a call option? If you do naked, the risk is unlimited for very limited profit, if you do cover, you'd have to buy the shares ahead of time. Seems like if the stock rises, they'll obviously exercise it and you lose or simply don't gain much money, then if the stock drops, you get to keep the amount you sold the option for, then lose money on the covers you actually bought? Is there something I'm missing here? 
5. If you sell naked puts and physically have no amount of money to buy, do they just freeze your account or put you in debt, or what exactly happens?

&amp;#x200B;

I currently own BABA and BAIDU.

&amp;#x200B;

BAIDU is one of my biggest holdings. I was waiting to break even to reduce my position, and almost managed to do so last week (my avg price is around 215, and last week it Baidu went up as high as 208). So I am still stuck with 235 shares, and currently incurring about 9.5K loss.

&amp;#x200B;

BABA used to be one of my biggest holdings as well. I started trimming it a while and I have sold most (on 3% profit), and now left only with 22 shares at avg price of 260 (about 24% down). 

Considering my Baidu holding is more than 10x my BABA, I am more concerned about that. Do you think I should trim a bit right now, say 25% or so, just in case things go even south? I was not afraid to risk more in Baidu with the last huge drop in Feb/March because that was mainly due to the archegos scandal (where the banks have to liquidate the holdings of archegos Baidu holdings to get back the money owed to them, at least that was my understanding), and not due to fundamentals and politics.

This is especially evident by the lower volumes recently and some key technical indicators flashing an over extension.

What do you think about these? Please set me straight. I need your thoughts.",Looking into these mining stocks for gains,1625745304
stocks,"Hey folks,

I'm a huge believer in anticipating stock movements based on options open interest. This will be a short post but it'll be worth your time.

First of all, what is open interest?

""**Open interest** indicates the total number of **open option contracts** that are currently out there"".

The word to remember here is ""open"" contracts. That means these are the contracts that people are sitting on, and have not sold yet. How can we use this information?

Basically, there are a couple of things I've observed in my backtests and some manual analysis.

1. Trends in open interest can anticipate stock directions. For instance, if call open interest keeps increasing while stock price stays almost the same, that can be an indication that a lot of people are buying calls, and are keeping their positions open. They wouldn't do it if they expect the price to stay the same or go down. This becomes really good when we see large changes in open interest
2. The opposite is true as well. If we see a huge decline in open interest of calls, that can mean people are not expecting any rally now and we might see a dip. This is the point I'm writing this post for.

Going forward with point # 2 above, if we look at the open interest for SPY, QQQ, and IWM from yesterday, we will see a clear pattern that signifies an anticipated dip. 

**$QQQ** open interest for calls and puts: [https://i.gyazo.com/64891f29341a8444a7789c6358fc0447.png](https://i.gyazo.com/64891f29341a8444a7789c6358fc0447.png)

**$IWM:** [https://i.gyazo.com/ffcfa8e5dbc0301d14338d375e0d9ce7.png](https://i.gyazo.com/ffcfa8e5dbc0301d14338d375e0d9ce7.png)

**$SPY:** [https://i.gyazo.com/8764dfc851a12c8b0e4dfd0d9ba0ba56.png](https://i.gyazo.com/8764dfc851a12c8b0e4dfd0d9ba0ba56.png)

You'll see a trend here. In all of these, either the PUTS open interest is increasing, or the calls open interest is decreasing. Both are signs of caution and looking at pre-market data today, this was a perfect way to anticipate that a downward move will happen soon.

Hope this is useful for everyone. I know some people are going to say this is hindsight, but I've been observing OI trends for the last 6 months, and they work really well.

Try it out with any other stock!!

Beijing's cybersecurity watchdog says the app illegally collected users' personal data.

The lawsuits, which were filed in federal court in New York and Los Angeles on Tuesday, say Didi failed to disclose ongoing talks it was having with Chinese authorities about its compliance with cybersecurity laws and regulations.

The complaints named Didi's chief Executive officer Will Wei Cheng and several other executives and directors. The lead underwriters for the company's share sale - Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase - were also named as defendants.

&gt;HONG KONG, July 8 (Reuters) - Chinese medical data group LinkDoc Technology Ltd [(LDOC.O)](https://www.reuters.com/companies/LDOC.O) has shelved plans for an IPO in the United States following [Beijing's clampdown on overseas listings by domestic firms](https://www.reuters.com/business/china-clampdown-could-spur-fresh-short-selling-us-listed-shares-says-s3-2021-07-07/), according to three sources with direct knowledge of the matter.  
&gt;  
&gt;It  is the first known Chinese firm to pull back from its IPO plans since  the crackdown began last week with an investigation by China's  cybersecurity regulator into ride-hailing giant Didi Global Inc [(DIDI.N)](https://www.reuters.com/companies/DIDI.N) just two days after it made its New York debut.  
&gt;  
&gt;Beijing  said on Tuesday that it would strengthen supervision of all Chinese  firms listed offshore, a sweeping regulatory shift that triggered a  sell-off in U.S.-listed Chinese stocks.  
&gt;  
&gt;The  decision to pull the LinkDoc deal was due to the crackdown, the sources  said. One of the sources said the regulatory uncertainty affected both  the company and investors.  
&gt;  
&gt;LinkDoc  filed for an initial public offering in the United States last month  and was due to price its shares after the U.S. market close on Thursday.  
&gt;  
&gt;It  had planned to sell 10.8 million shares between $17.50 and $19.50 each.  The deal would have raised $211 million at the upper end of the  indicated range. The book closed one day earlier than planned on  Wednesday, two of the sources said.

&amp;#x200B;

I watched all the videos linked on the article. I'm not too worried about the 25% dip in value. If you believe ride-hailing, or not even ride hailing but a single platform app which connects to multiple modes and products, is the future then this price is still a steal for Didi. It's a quarter of the price of UBER, yet China's market is vastly larger than America's. Let's also not forget that Didi bought out Uber.  In addition, the Chinese populace completely bypassed the manual check writing phase, credit cards and swiping, and manual taxi hailing. They went from billions of bicycles to suddenly ditching their bicycles and buying hundreds of millions of BUICKS for goodness sake, and a whole market of designated, professional drivers/chaffeurs. Didi is not going to disappear just like Wechat is not going to disappear. 

Chinese regulators are just able to do what American politicians often like to talk about but whose American regulators are not able to or cannot act swiftly enough to implement. China doesn't want to fail Didi, they merely want to ensure that because it's listed in America, America cannot use it's own laws to extract data from Chinese citizens or impose penalties/sanctions on high level Communist figures connected to the company. It's similar to the America move which does not want Huawei deployed in the US so that China cannot extract data from American citizens and companies. The difference is is that Huawei is a Chinese company so the American government has no financial reason and every political reason to scuttle Huawei, while promoting it's own brands. Didi, on the other hand, is a Chinese-developed and China based company with it's primary market and customers in China. The Chinese government is not going to kill it. They're just going make sure to that it's sealed legally and has figurative firewalls separating it from the reach of the American government.",Should you invest in Chinese tech companies after crackdown?,1625719725

PulteGroup is a residential home builder based in Atlanta and formed in 1956.  They are the fourth largest homebuilder in the US after $DHI, $LEN, and $NVR.  They have a number of different brands and are vertically integrated in the homebuilding process from purchasing undeveloped land to selling completed homes.  They develop communities with single family detached homes, townhouses, duplexes and condos.  Their target market is middle class Americans and they also develop residential communities focused on senior living in 23 different states.  45% of their customers are ‘moving up’, 31% are first time home buyers and 24% are purchasing senior living options.

When purchasing land, they claim they use well developed data models to predict socioeconomic trends for housing markets in cities and isolated communities.  The auditor seemed very optimistic about their computer models as compared to $MDC, a similar homebuilder.

They sell homes in two ways:

* Speculative homes: homes that have already been built.  PHM expects that these homes will be purchased based on their own analysis of the region
* Pre-ordered homes: homes that are customized by a committed buyer.  The buyer puts down some principal capital that is usually non-refundable and has to prove that they are adequately covered to purchase or finance the home.

They run a mortgage issuance segment that mostly issues mortgages to their homebuyers and then sells the mortgage to some other institution in order to reduce the risk on their own balance sheet.

They control 180,352 lots in total.  5000 in the NW, 15000 in the SE, 21000 in Florida, 9700 in the midwest, 16000 in texas, and 25000 in the west.  30% of lots are developed.  91, 363 of these lots are owned, and 88,989 are optioned.  43% of owned lots are developed and 16% of optioned lots are developed. See Note 2. At the bottom of the report for more info on the regions.

**Management overview:**

I’ve heard the grandson of the founder speak, and all I can say is it was a good decision keeping him out of the CEO position.  People have a good opinion of the company from what is on glassdoor.  There are a few comments about management being bureaucratic and putting unnecessary pressure on employees, but these only account for a small percentage of comments.

CEO: Ryan Marshall.  He has an accounting and business degree, but it looks like he has only ever worked for PHM.  He has over 20 years at PHM and his compensation was over 13 million dollars.  This seems way too high for a CEO of a company this size.  He has very good reviews on glassdoor (94% approval).

CFO: Bob O’Shaughnessy.  Has an accounting degree.  He has a much more diverse work experience than the CEO, but it isn’t in housing.  He spent 10 years at Ernst and Young, 14 years at Penske as the CFO, and then 10 years at PGH as CFO.  He has past CFO experience so I wouldn't be worried about him making irrational decisions.

## Addressable Market

This section is speculative, they do not provide a breakdown of their target markets so I had to do some reverse engineering to get to this conclusion.

Their main business is single family homes, which account for 85% of their revenue.  They talk vaguely about who they target, but it is quite clear to me after looking at the homes they sell that their target market is the middle class with a bit more in savings than most.  Their homes are good quality, and their senior living arrangements are standalone homes with a lot of customization and community amenities available.  From my analysis I think it is fair to state that their average buyer is in the upper middle class, and the retirees who buy homes have an average amount of savings, although there is serious interest from wealthier seniors.

## Risk

PHM is directly exposed to the volatility of the housing industry.  They are a middleman in real estate ownership and try to keep their inventory turnover below 36 months.  The way they purchase land is akin to dollar cost averaging.  They purchase land more frequently than 36 months, and their long term assets are constantly changing.  This brings us to the possibility of significant reduction in real estate value.  Sure they might lose paper value on their balance sheet but there is still a fixed selling price that they will generate significant operating cash flows from.

Thankfully, there is a very prominent event that is an example of the worst case scenario for homebuilders - [check this out](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/economy/reports/2017/04/13/430424/2008-housing-crisis/) if you don't know what I am talking about.  They took a big hit because of the dropoff of demand.  It took 6 years, or four housing cycles to build back to pre 2008 levels, and they had three years of negative earnings.  They managed to decrease debt and took the unfavorable but appropriate approach of selling 150 million shares, an increase of 60 percent.  Since then they have bought back those 150 million shares but who's to say there isn’t another housing crisis on the horizon?  I have looked closely at common and uncommon indicators and all I see is a lack of supply but there is obviously much more that I am completely blind to.

The mortgages they keep on their balance sheet are slightly worrisome, but when I think about it, if the homeowner defaults, the home will just be repossessed by PHM.  So not much of a concern.

They are vulnerable to commodity price inflation, but the distribution and acquisition of these works the same way as their land purchases do.  Non land inventory is purchased regardless of the price, and home prices tend to slightly outperform the general CPI so this doesn't really concern me as it balances out the same way as land purchases.

One unconventional risk they face is the lack of skilled laborers.  The average age of construction workers has increased by [two years in the past seven years](https://sgchorizon.com/construction-industry-workforce-getting-older).  There are more and more people going to post secondary school trying to make more money and do less work each year.  This really does pose a significant risk to PHM in the long run.  Less human capital supply means higher wages means lower margins means less operational cash generation means more debts and less cash means ultimately a more unstable and unhealthy business.  No matter what happens otherwise in the economy, I think this could be their biggest long term risk.

Their ‘in your face’ optimism in their annual report isn’t captivating me.  They also say that they think past stock price performance compared to the DOW home constructors index “represents a meaningful analysis for investors” ([Page 19](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/822416/000082241621000007/phm-20201231.htm) above the stock performance chart).  Again, this is really immature for the auditor to say this.  They have competitive financials and a good company, so there is no reason for the auditor to go so overboard when they prepare reports.  This stuff always makes me suspicious.

## Revenue Breakdown / Company segments

96% or revenue is from all homebuilding operations.  This figure is 10.7 Billion:

* 45% of their customers are not making their first purchase.  This section excludes seniors.
* 31% are first time home buyers.
* 24% are purchasing senior living options.

The remainder is from their financial services.  This figure is 0.362 Billion.

Their average annual output of homes was 24600 last year.  It has been growing slowly in the past three years at about 2% YoY.

## Industry position

Some of their competitors are $DHI, $LEN, $NVR, $TOL, $LGIH, and $KBH to list a few.  PHM has the lowest P/E and PEG, and their P/S AND P/B are average out of their competitors. Their D/E and margins are competitive, but they are lagging with their ROE/ROA/ROI.  Free cash flow is currently at about 30% of the market cap but this is not usually the case.

They have an estimated 6.1% market share in American residential construction.

## Overview/Growth and Developments

Growth: Revenue took a turn for the worse in the late 2000s, but since then it has almost returned to pre 2008 levels.  The growth has been very steady

Margins:

* Margins seem to hover between 8-13%, and there hasn't been much change over the years.  The values are the same before 2007

Net reinvestment:

* They have a BBB- Credit rating
* A lot of capital expenditures go towards land that is either held and sold or developed
* Not much R&amp;D that would benefit them.

Share buybacks:

* Share buybacks have been good since 2008.  They have shown that they are capable of taking action to add shareholder value
* Their massive issuance in 2008 also shows that they are willing to raise capital and diminish shareholder value if it is needed for the business.
* The implications are mixed here.  If I am looking from a shareholders perspective, then I would be skeptical of their excessive issuance in the past, but if I was looking at it as a long term business owner, it shows responsibility and willingness to sacrifice their reputation if it can keep their business strong.
* They have bought back almost all of the shares they issued in 2008.

Costs:

* They are consistently putting more money into paying off debts than they are taking out debt.
* One thing to consider in their operational costs is they are forced to pay market prices for commodities.  They don’t keep a lot of inventory so these costs may become harder to manage unless they raise home prices along with the CPI.  They have a 24-36 month lag behind the CPI in pricing their marketable assets because of the nature of the building contracts with their buyers.
* They had their second most successful year in 2020, and instead of massive bonuses they decided to:
   * Repay all 700M drawn on their revolving credit facility
   * Repurchase $75M in shares
   * Increase dividends by 17% (Why so much?  Invest back into the business or buy more shares)
   * Committed to an early completion of notes due 2026-7 (Done Mar ‘21)

Debts:

* They have 411M in financial services debt and 2.752B in Notes payable.
* The notes payable is adequately spread over 15 years.  The highest interest is 7.9% due 2032 and the average interest rate is 5.5%.  As long as their operations are at least half as strong, their debt won’t be a problem.  Interest expenses and retirement on these on average will cost them 180M/year
* Financial services debt is of no concern with an average interest rate of 3%.

Assets:

* Assets have grown since 2011.
* They have just under 13 B in assets
* They currently have less assets then they did in 2005-06
* Most of their assets are in PPE but they still keep 3.2 B in current assets.

WACC: 8.5%

Long term growth rate: They will grow with the housing market, but also shrink with it.  3.5-3.8% organic growth per year is reasonable.

Legal: Nothing

Recent/expected developments:

* They have 13657 homes in production currently, with 10421 of those already sold.
* No expected developments

## Industry advantages

Suppose this data driven model they talk about really can predict socioeconomic trends in neighborhoods or to-be neighborhoods.  This would offer huge profitability advantages for them, but unfortunately so far their margins and growth are pretty in par with the industry.

They do have an advantage as a publicly traded company of their size.  Lots of access to capital and large capital reserves make it easy for them to have many operations simultaneously in different parts of the country.

They have a healthier history internally compared to competitors.  Their finances have stayed intact even in the worst case scenario and they have shown a better than average ability to rebound after hardship.  This is because of the financial maturity and responsibility management has taken over the years and hopefully this is a culture that continues in the business.

## Sell side VS Buy side

I am more bullish on this one, but here are two arguments for two different opinions.  I will limit them to five points each:

**Sell:**

* They did not hesitate to reduce shareholder value in 2008 instead of alternate debt financing.  This shows that they are willing to do it again.
* Prevailing sentiment is split - there is a possibility of a massive real estate crash in the near future
* Economic conditions are favorable right not, but it is expected that they will not be as favorable in the future
* Some of their corporate paper is sold at quite a high yield, which may be grounds for default if they do not sell shares or more debt in the event of financial difficulties.
* The demand for skilled workers is and will be rising, making it more difficult for PHM to acquire valuable human capital without raising wages.

**Buy:**

* They have steady organic growth
* Management has shown more than once that they are responsible.  In bad times they are capable of sacrificing shareholder value for more shareholder value in the future.  In good times they make good on future obligations early and don’t get too euphoric with expansions and bonuses.
* Their asset and debt structures are very attractive - with adequate coverage of debts and not a lot of outstanding obligations
* They have great ability to generate lots of capital in good times and store that capital away.
* The economic conditions indicate a shortage of residential housing, so even if there is an economic catastrophe in the near future, PHM and other homebuilders will still be needed to fill a 5.5 million house void in the country.  This figure is only going to grow too without federal intervention which either way is advantageous for PHM.

## Valuation

Assuming a dividend growth of 1 %, a 3.8% expected growth from the company and an 8% rate of return, the Gordon model gives them a $10.7 valuation per share. Their intrinsic value calculated from the DCF model is between $70-100, giving an average margin of 35%.  Of course the DCF model makes the assumption that OCF and investments will be stable and follow my predicted growth rates, so this is a subjective valuation no matter how accurate I think it may be.

## Valuation Market Comparison

The average intrinsic values I have found for the industry show that the industry is overvalued by about 15%, giving PHM a potential relative valuation of 50% undervalued.

## Opinion

I would give $PHM a buy rating.  They have a strong, cash generating business model.  There is more risk associated with owning them than a comparable consumer staples business, but there is also much more potential reward and in my opinion the reward is more likely to be realized than the risk.  This is something I would be comfortable holding in my portfolio.

stocks,"So what does that mean, the market has turned upside down? What does that mean when the Nasdaq is hitting new highs everyday but many of the stocks I watch are down? What is this divergence? Is the Nasdaq index accurate? What stocks are actually up?

So yesterday 7/6/2021, I was surfing on Reddit and I did come across some Warren Buffet videos. The oracle of Omaha and well deserved. I have read a couple of his books maybe 10-12 years ago, read much about him but actually didn't see these videos until yesterday. In a nut shell he stated that you can not time the markets, no one can time the market, the best time to buy, is when you first see value and if anything but it in increments. The 2nd thing he stated was that he does not buy anything where he does not see value..... if it does not make money now..... because you can not predict the future, ""a bird in the hand right now, is worth 2 more in the bush."" That means if you have a solid company making money now, do not jump ship and buy/speculate on something that is losing money/growing or for the short term perceives to be doing alot better. This paragraph will become important as I answer these questions. I hope to help calm everyones' nerves with the answers to these questions.

I have wrote in many posts, as far back as a few weeks that the market is upside down, ever since the Nasdaq was at 13,800-14,000 and fed Powell was about to speak. The market upside down is when stocks that make money, have cash, give dividends, have the ability to buyback shares, raise dividends are falling like knives. Something like AFIN dipped under 8! NYCB under 11! (Again today, thanx for the trade), NYMT under 4.50 (Here we go again).. These are stocks that I constantly trade, and tell the elite team to trade when we are forced to pivot and seek safety. Why? Because they can do all of those things....... A company that does not make money, can not buy shares, can not raise dividends, and even as the stock drops they want to print more shares..

Many followers and the elite team are asking me what do I think is going on, why is the Nasdaq making new highs but I see a sea of red? So, I did alot of digging this week. The Nasdaq is indeed a cap weighted Index.. So is the SP and Nasdaq 100 are all cap weighted. That means as the market cap of a company grows (That is the overall value of a company) the meaning and weight it carries on the index grows as well....Why does this matter? The big 5, AAPL, MSFT, AMZN, GOOG, FB... account for 40% of the nasdaq!!!! Look it up! I just did, because I am supposed to be all knowing! You guys do keep me sharp! AAPL alone accounts for 12% of the nasdaq index and nearly 20% of QQQ (Nasdaq 100). The Nasdaq has almost 5,000 tickers. So the fact that 5 company's can shift 40% or more! of the market means that 4,000 can call and 150 can be up and the NASDAQ can be up! Is that possible? Yesterday there were 4 decliners for every advancer.. (4,000 down, 1,000 up) that is 7/6/2021. Today 7/7/2021 there were about 1.5 decliners for every advancer. (3,000 down and 2,000 up)..... In fact the US equity market is about 50 trillion and covers about 12-13,000 tickers amongst the NYSE, NASDAQ, AMEX and OTC... These 5 make up about 10 trillion!! So, just these 5 are 20% of the entire US market!! Yes! Now, I knew they were important and cap weighted I just didnt know how so..... because these stocks are making record all time highs, the Nasdaq is at 14,600-14,700 and its a sea of red. I started to see what was up and saw these mighty titans and some speculative stocks.. So that is your answer....... it is happening, why the Nasdaq is making new highs and I see a sea of red. So the Nasdaq is accurate, their is no mistake. Some stocks like SE, BILL are going sky high, LMND bouncing back but these are strictly speculative, snow.......

What is the danger in this? Why does it matter? Because I was even telling my elite team to me, we are already near a correction. If you take out 25 of the largest cap company's their is no doubt the Nasdaq is already down 5-10% but we cant see it! They have asked me other ways to track what is going on...... The only other way is to track other nasdaq important stocks to know, because if you track these 5 that mean the most, they are making highs. The danger in this is if they fall, it may cause a panic and speculative stocks will really crash! Because if the Nasdaq is at record highs and most people do not know its a few company's bringing up the market if the Nasdaq as a whole falls to 14,000 it may cause panic!

What do we do? I am going back defensive after I sell of some of my offensive stocks....Or I will buy an offensive stock after its down at least 5% on the day.....

Recall earlier the paragraph about Warren Buffet and buy value, cash cows, and buy more when fear is instilled elsewhere........ When the market started to turn upside down, an amazing value stock I had was TX, it dipped to 31, I did buy more, albeit in fear and traded it. It has bounced back to near 52 week highs as of today near 42. So that is a 30+ percent move in 2 weeks on a safe stock that makes cash! AFIN, BRMK, NYCB, they all recovered and made for great trades.... Today I am given another trading opportunity in NYCB and NYMT.......Now an offensive play, give it, these are Chinese are getting crushed and they are offensive. TIGR and VIPS. TIGR rose to 30!! It is now under 21...... VIPS dipped to 15 and change went back to 20.66 and has dropped this week because of DIDI (Chinese).. Same with TIGR.. I do own VIPS at 21.... I have been trading TIGR.... I just wanted you all to see what the difference is of a defensive play making tons of cash \[1 in the hand, 2 in the bush\]..... Now I do believe VIPS and TIGR are 2 offensive plays that should rise but we do have to be careful....

So in short, the market is upside down, being held by a few stocks. I refer to the Nasdaq as most of us trade tech/growth. I hope this explains much, and calms nerves for people with stocks that make cash!!!","The Nasdaq and market keep making record highs, my watch lists are a sea of red. What gives?

Eventually a correction is coming in the market. I think it’ll happen with 6 months.
When this happens, I’d like to have as much cash on hand as possible to buy on the dip. I was thinking of selling 10% of my portfolio for cash to buy on the dip.
But my question is, would it be wise to sell stocks I have now to get some cash? Or would the tax implications be that I’d be better off not selling and just holding, waiting for the dip to end? I live in the USA and most of the stocks I have are NOT considered “long term” by the IRS so I’d be at a tax disadvantage. I think only 20% of my portfolio is considered “long term” holding because I reinvested most of my portfolio fairly recently.

I don’t really know about the numbers involved so I’d appreciate the advice of people with more experience. Thanks.

Does anyone have a formula to balance a portfolio by adding money and only buying stocks on “best effort basis”

Assume we have 5 stocks
And we want all to be 20% of the portfolio

No lets say time pass
And now their weight is 40-30-5-15-10
And the total value is 2000$
That means that the value is

So we kinda have bazillion ways to balance it on best effort basis,

stocks,"I have been Following the OPEC saga because 17% of my portfolio is invested in a triple leverage oil ETF (NRGU).

Here's what's going on: 

\-OPEC is in the driver's seat with the US not producing much more, and with a daily deficit of 2.2M oil barrel per day globally. Demand is going up, it is lucrative opportunity.

\-They have to catch up the losses from last year. A war is not in not in the favor of anyone

\- Saudi Arabia is playing the role of father: Being prudent, even if the economy looks better, we never know what will happen with that virus. Better to stay stable for a little while more, and to not produce much more.

\-United Arab Emirates (UAE) invested a lot before the pandemic to increase his production capacity. They see that it would be a golden opportunity to use it. They really want to diversify their economy for the future with that oil money. They don't want to miss the opportunity since the US might increase its production in 2022, and the global demand of oil will most likely trend downward.

\-On the new OPEC deal, everyone agree to only increase the production by 400k barrels per day until April 2022. There's no issue here, they must ""kill"" the extra supply.

\-Saudi Arabia wants to extend that 400k production beyond April 2022. UAE wants to produce more after that date. Looks like all the parties agree on everything except after April 2022.

\-Until a new agreement, the old deal stays: The supply won't increase by 400k barrels per day. This would push the oil price higher with the global demand that keeps increasing.

&amp;#x200B;

3 possible scenario:

1) No new deal: Keep the same production. This would shake the market with a lot of concerns on the short term (unpredictable). The UEA doesn't seem to be in a rush to conclude a new deal because everyone agrees to only increase the supply by only 400k. The present deal is good until April 2022, so it is not a big deal for them to ""extend"" the conversation. However, the longer it stays like that, the more it would be considerate as a relationship deterioration. 

2) New deal: The are men of honor, they come to an agreement. It is a good opportunity, and unlike last year, the market is favorable. They might plan to increase the production after April 2022 to a certain degree to satisfy everyone.

3) UAE leaves OPEC: It is highly unlikely. It is not in the interest of anyone to start a production war. They are stronger working together to control the supply (cartel), instead of being individualist in a free market. A production war would be bad for every body.

Conclusion: Short term uncertainty. In most cases, the oil price will stay high due to the low supply. Unlikely that UAE makes drama for weeks. So far, the present deal stands, the production stays low with a 2.2M deficit of barrels per day. Demand is projecting to keep going higher with the deconfinement.

It could be a buying opportunity with a nice risk/reward.","OPEC+ Situation, no new deal yet, Oil price being shaken",1625689738
stocks,"**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, July 7, 2021**

Stocks finished higher again, with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ) once again recording fresh intraday highs thanks to continued strength in mega-cap tech stocks like Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), and Amazon (AMZN). The Dow Jones (DIA), which has been lagging the other two indexes the last six or so weeks, continued to underperform comparatively. Market participants are currently digesting the Fed’s June meeting minutes (basically notes of what was discussed) and are looking ahead to Q2 earnings season, which is set to kick off next week with big banks reporting. 

Oil prices remain under heavy pressure after recently reaching a multi-year high. In the latest meeting, the two most important members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), failed to reach a deal to increase crude oil production as energy demand rebounds. At the time of writing, Brent crude settled down $2.63 a barrel, or 3.4%, to $74.53, after hitting a session peak of $77.84, its highest since October 2018. The U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures settled down $1.79, or 2.4%, to $73.37 after touching $76.98, highest since November 2014. Some analysts have speculated that in light of the failure to reach a unilateral decision, individual oil producers may begin to act alone to increase production. Bob Yawger, Director of Energy Futures at Mizuho, said “The market is concerned that the UAE will step in and unilaterally add barrels and other members in OPEC will follow suit.” The White House said Tuesday it was closely monitoring talks by OPEC+ and was ""encouraged"" after conversations with officials in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.

For equity investors, the focus was squarely on the Federal Reserve’s June Meeting minutes, which will help market participants decipher that path forward for monetary policy and possible timelines for any adjustments. The Fed said the economic recovery “was generally seen as not having yet been met”, but said they are ready to act if inflationary pressures indeed begin to materialize. The minutes said, “Participants generally judged that, as a matter of prudent planning, it was important to be well positioned to reduce the pace of asset purchases, if appropriate, in response to unexpected economic developments, including faster-than anticipated progress toward the Committee’s goals or the emergence of risks that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals”. This is not surprising, as I have been saying for weeks now, as the pace of economic recovery improves, quantitative easing, or the purchase of government bonds in order to inject money into the economy, is always the first policy to be tapered. I am not worried about the tapering of quantitative easing and encourage everyone to read up about the 2013 Taper Tantrum, which happened when the Fed announced QE would be tapered since the economy had largely recovered from the 2008 crisis by then.

In short, the Federal Reserve is maintaining current policies in place but noted they were prepared to act if unforeseen pressures or progress to their goals emerged.Mark Haefele, Chief Investment Officer at UBS Global Wealth Management said of the minutes, “If the US economic recovery continues to accelerate to a sufficiently robust level into the summer, the Fed is expected to signal rolling back its asset purchases later this year. But the actual tapering would only take place in 2022, and we believe markets have largely priced in this expectation.” I fully agree, while I expect choppiness when the Fed makes more concrete statements about the taper timeline but do not see that derailing the current bull market. 

**Highlights**

* Lots of news surrounding Chinese ride-hailing giant Didi. Last week, the company went public on Thursday, however, over the weekend the Chinese government, in another crackdown of a large tech company, ordered Didi removed from app stores, citing cybersecurity complaints. Now there are reports coming out that Didi pressed ahead with the IPO despite the CCP suggesting the company delay due to “security concerns”. Shares are down double-digits in each of the sessions this week.
* The Labor Department's monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Summary showed U.S. job openings increased to 9.209 million in May. This followed a downwardly revised 9.193 million in April, which was brought down from the 9.286 million previously reported
* U.S. mortgage applications declined for a second straight week last week, declining to the lowest level in a year-and-a-half as home price growth and low housing inventories weighed further on purchasing activity. 
* Pentagon officials announced they terminated Microsoft’s massive $10 billion Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure (JEDI) cloud-computing contract and said they would start fresh with a new project, putting an end to a yearslong initiative that was unpopular in Congress and mired in litigation from Amazon (AMZN). In terminating the contract, officials said they focused largely on technical reasons, saying advances in cloud-computing in recent years have made JEDI obsolete.
* Yesterday, Nvidia (NVDA) unveiled the Cambridge-1, which the company claims is the most powerful supercomputer in the UK. The computer will be dedicated to studying and analyzing the healthcare industry.

stocks," The following is a slightly edited excerpt from the book Security Analysis. The passage was written in 1934 and it is amazing how valid it is today.

In security analysis, there are two general attitudes that go into determining the market price of securities. They are investment attitudes and speculative attitudes.

Speculative attitudes include the following:

Market factors:

* Technical factors
* Manipulative factors
* Psychological factors

Speculative and investment attitudes may share the following attitudes:

Future value factors:

* Management
* Competitive conditions
* Possible and probably changes in volume, price, and costs

Investment attitudes are distinct from speculative attitudes in that they asses objective intrinsic value factors:

Intrinsic value factors:

* Earnings
* Dividends
* Assets
* Capital and Debt Structure
* Terms of the issue
* Other metrics that are considered fact.

All of these factors together form the attitude of the public towards the issue - causing them to present bids and asks at the price they deem appropriate to exchanges that in turn forms the current market price. Of course there have been many new developments since this was written, but big banks scalping for a few cents per share on each trade doesn't change the facts above.

It seems like good practice to think about all of these before making a purchase or sale to form a final opinion on if the transaction is an investment or a speculation, and even to think about what the person on the opposite side of the transaction is thinking.

Also goes to show that if efficient market theory really does exist, then the value of equities may be extremely disjoint with what its financial intrinsic value is.

The purpose of this post is not to enrage or start an argument like how some people tend to interpret posts, but rather to create some discussion points and hopefully add to all of our knowledge base or at least make you take a second and think about it.",The relationship between intrinsic value and market price,1625688283

stocks,"Garrett Motion is the world's largest manufacturer of automotive turbochargers with \~35% global market share and over $3 billion in annual revenue. A former Honeywell subsidiary, Garrett has been in the turbocharger business for over 60 years. The company, which has a cult following (see image of customer tattoos at the end of this email), shares a duopoly position with #2 market leader, BorgWarner (30% market share).

Garrett was spun out of Honeywell in late 2018 under the official guise of ""business simplification."" In reality, Honeywell used the spinoff to dump over $1.3 billion of asbestos litigation claims associated with its old Bendix brake business from the 1980s. As a result, Garrett was stuck making onerous annual payments to resolve asbestos claims associated with a business that it had nothing to do with. After numerous negotiation attempts with Honeywell failed, Garrett voluntarily filed for Ch. 11 in September 2020.

Companies usually often file for bankruptcy due to either liquidity or solvency issues. In most of these situations, the poor business economics that led to the bankruptcy in the first place have not changed post-restructuring. However, a third more rare reason for filing bankruptcy exists: to restructure a contingent liability that is unrelated to the core business. In this case, Garrett filed because it had more leverage in the Chapter 11 process to reduce its Honeywell asbestos payments. After a 7-month long reorganization and competitive auction process, GTX emerged in April 2021 with the original equity intact, a cleaner balance sheet, and significantly reduced asbestos liabilities.

As a quick industry overview, a turbocharger uses a vehicle's exhaust gas to spin a fan that forces more air (and thus more fuel) into an engine than it could otherwise naturally consume. It allows an engine to generate as much or more power than a larger non-turbo engine, thereby reducing emissions and improving fuel economy (by up to 20% and 40% for gasoline and diesel engines, respectively). As a result, the adoption of turbochargers has increased significantly over the last two decades as fuel efficiency and emission standards have become stricter across the world. In 2000, only 1% of light-duty vehicles came with turbochargers. By 2019, \~50% of all new light-duty vehicles produced globally came equipped with a turbo. This figure is growing annually (excluding 2020), as turbos continue to be heavily incorporated into both pure-ICE and hybrid vehicles. Thus, despite the looming shadow of electric vehicles, the global turbocharger industry is expected to grow at a \~10% CAGR until 2027, with Asia becoming the fastest growing and largest market.

Garrett has an impregnable competitive position with high barriers to entry in the industry. In fact, Bosche and Mahle, two of the largest auto suppliers in the world, formed a JV in 2008 to capitalize on the anticipated skyrocketing demand for turbochargers and in the process, try and break the Garrett/BorgWarner duopoly. Almost a decade later, despite the turbo market's actual growth surpassing all projections, Bosche and Mahle conceded and sold the JV to a Hong Kong PE firm in 2017. The reason was that they failed to achieve economies of scale and gave up trying to invest more capital to try and make more headway into the industry. Essentially, the 60+ years of engineering, product development, and auto OEM relationships at both Garrett and BorgWarner proved impossible to beat. Furthermore, turbochargers are incorporated into engines early in the design process and years in advance, leading to very high switching costs once production begins. This also gives GTX strong revenue visibility, with 95% of 2022, 88% of 2023, and 80% of 2024 revenues already contracted. The company is also well-diversified across geographies and customers.

The elephant in the room, of course, is electric vehicles. Since EVs have no exhaust, turbochargers will be nonexistent in a full EV world. However, we are still extremely far away from that, and even as the EV market continues to rapidly grow, it will only further speed up the adoption of turbochargers as the pressure ramps up on ICE and hybrids to become more fuel efficient and powerful. Furthermore, the proposed holding period for this investment is much shorter than the time it will take for the turbocharger market to begin declining due to EVs (likely closer to 2030 and beyond).

Currently, GTX shares trade at \~6x 2021 earnings and \~5x 2022 earnings vs. 12x and 11x at BorgWarner. GTX also has 20% higher EBITDA margins than Borg (18% vs. 15%) and nearly identical leverage (1.1x vs 0.9x). GTX is also growing revenues faster than BWA and the overall industry: Q1 2021 revenues came in +19% over Q1 2019 (since 2020 comparisons are irrelevant), while BWA Q1 2021 revenues were flat, and the global auto market was down more than 11% seasonally adjusted. Given that Garrett is growing by a double digit margin over both its largest competitor and the overall industry, it can even be argued that the stock deserves to trade at a premium to BWA. It has also become evident that management projected very conservative financials to its lenders during restructuring. This was likely to minimize the perceived value of the business while financing was lined up and to keep the stock price low as the new compensation structure and associated stock and option strike price awards were being set. To illustrate, Q1 2021 guidance given in late February to lenders was $868 million revenue and $129 million EBITDA. Actual numbers came out to $997 million revenue and $176 million EBITDA. Thus, there's a strong chance we will get the sweet spot of both multiple expansion and stronger-than-expected earnings growth.

Furthermore, several prominent PE firms and distressed debt hedge funds including Oaktree, Centerbridge, and Baupost led the company out of the restructuring process and provided most of the equity injection in the form of convertible preferred stock ($5.25 conversion price, 1:1 common). Including the now in-the-money preferred stock that will be mandatorily converted in under 2 years, these firms collectively own over 75% of GTX and are very incentivized to see the share price trade much higher.The stock was already uplisted onto the NASDAQ in early May, which provided a nice bump to the stock price. Remaining catalysts include the listing of the preferred stock, planned simplification of the capital structure (from currently equity + 2 classes of preferred stock + bank debt to just equity + bank debt), and continued strong financial performance. Full sell-side analyst coverage should also resume in the near future, further attracting more investor interest.

To conclude, Garrett did not enter restructuring because it had liquidity or solvency issues. In fact, the company continued to generate strong financial results throughout that time. Now that the company has emerged, we have the opportunity to buy a high-quality, growing business at a huge discount, thanks to the bankruptcy association (regardless of the reason). I expect the stock to re-rate significantly as the company continues to generate strong financial results, and the bankruptcy connotation wears off over time.

In the past decade, growth stocks have crushed the broader indices, driven by a spectacular bull run in the equity markets. While the COVID-19 pandemic decimated the stock market in early 2020, the snap-back rally pushed major indices to record highs, primarily due to growth stocks in the technology space.

The shift towards telehealth solutions has accelerated in the last 15 months due to the need for social distancing and economic lockdowns imposed by several countries. However, this trend is likely to continue in 2021 and beyond, making WELL Health and CloudMD solid long-term bets.

WELL Health has been on an absolute tear since its IPO five years back. WELL stock has returned a staggering 8,700% after it went public, which means a $1,000 investment just after its IPO would be worth close to $88,000 today.

This astonishing growth has been supported by a strong uptick in sales and improvement in profit margins. WELL Health has increased sales from $5.9 million in 2018 to $50.24 million in 2020. Comparatively, its operating loss stood at $2.09 million in 2018, or 35.4% of sales, while in 2020, the company reported an operating loss of $10.4 million, or 20.7% of sales.

WELL Health stock is valued at a price-to-2022-sales multiple of 4.6, which is really cheap considering its growth estimates.

Both WELL Health and CloudMD are exciting bets for investors looking to beat the market. However, if I have to choose a winner, it would have to be WELL Health given its larger revenue base and lower valuation metrics.

This is purely for educational purposes for newer traders who may be looking for some reference as to what a trading system can look like. Would love to hear other people's system as well!*

Hello friends!

You may know me as the guy who writes the Daily Market Recaps on here. Today, I wanted to share a small article I wrote about trading systems. I remember when I was first getting started in the market and beginning my education, I would always hear people say ""you need a trading system in order to be successful"", but didn't know what that meant or how to get started. Fast forward a few years, I have been blessed enough to make a living as a trader and investor, so I wanted to share some of the things I have learned.

Basically, a trading system is a set of parameters designed to remove as much emotion from trading as possible (can't count how many mistakes I have made by getting too emotional during a trade). Today I wanted to share a very simple swing-trading system I use that only uses two indicators: Fibonacci retracements and moving averages (50, 200-day)

**Enter the trade with a plan** \- Before we enter any swing trade, we use technical analysis to find entry levels, price targets, and stop losses. Entering a trade without a plan leaves you ill-prepared to both profit if the trade works or cut your losses before the bag becomes too heavy.

**Find High Probability Entry Using Technical Analysis** \- As discussed above, I technical analysis to determine high probability levels of entry during a pullback. As a rule of thumb, always wait for confirmation that a support holds before entering a trade. I want to see either the stock bounce off the support with conviction or begin to consolidate, forming a new base near the new support.

* In an uptrend, the 50 day moving average (MA) or 23.6% and 38.2%  Fibonacci retracement are usually strong supports
* In a downtrend, the 200MA or 50% and 61.8% Fibonacci retracement are usually strong supports
* If a stock breaks below all these supports, wait for it to establish a new base for itself. The 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level and 200MA are the last lines of defense, do not try and catch a falling knife. Wait for the stock to begin building a new base, patience is key.

**Adhere to a 2:1 Risk/Reward ratio** \- When entering a trade, always make sure the reward is at least double the potential risk. This way, the profit from winners is always bigger than the potential loss from the losers. I do this by setting the stop loss at 50% of the potential profit we are targeting. For example, if I am targeting a 10% gain from a trade, the stop loss will be set 5% below entry. Of course, not all trades will work out but in this way, we maximize our wins while minimizing our losses

**Stick to your Stop Losses** \-  In trading stop losses are your friend. They protect your capital in case the trade goes sour. Even the best trader’s in the world don’t get it right anytime, protecting your capital is very important. While it might be tempting to “diamond hand” and wait for recovery, the goal of trading is not to become an investor. Cut your losses quickly before they become unmanageable and move on. There is opportunity every day in the market.

**If the trade works out, set stops to entry** \- If the trade starts working out, it is very important to then raise your stop loss and set it at your original entry price. This guarantees the trade will become risk-free, meaning you will either profit or, worst-case scenario, break even. If the trade is really working out and is up a good amount from entry, I will keep raising the stop loss to protect the profit. While trading, it is imperative never to let your gains become losses, at the worst we want to walk away from a trade breaking even.",A Simple Swing Trading System I use,1625680420

Intellabridge Technology Corporation a blockchain technology company, has filed a base short form prospectus to qualify for distribution up to $50 million CAD of the Company's securities. 

The Company only intends to raise capital for corporate purposes, including, for marketing, business development, and other strategic objectives. The Company does not intend to immediately complete an offering of the entire amount reserved under the Shelf Prospectus but, rather intends to strategically raise capital as required.

""We decided to do a shelf prospectus to enable the Company to better control the price, terms and size of future offerings and better meet demand at prevailing market prices. We expect to use this financing option as needed depending on the Company's strategic objectives and market conditions,"" explains John Eagleton, CEO of Intellabridge.

""I would like to thank shareholders for their continued support.""

Some pros and cons for both that I can think of:

**WBA Pros**:

\- Sitting on a lot of cash after selling Alliance business for $6.3 billion

\- Had a good earnings report where they beat estimates and showed good growth

\- Hired Rosalind Brewer as their new CEO, who was instrumental in Starbucks' digital transformation as their COO

\- They are looking to open up urgent care style clinics in their stores which will drive more traffic 

\- It offers a nice dividend of \~3.9%

**WBA Cons**:

\- Their most recent earning numbers were good largely in part due to the Covid vaccine rush, which they predicted would be a lot less next quarter and later in the year

\- Wallstreet analysts are still not very bullish on the stock with a Hold rating on it and a 1 yr price target of $54

**CVS Pros**:

\- also offers a nice dividend yield of 2.4%

\- has more favorable analyst ratings and a 1 yr price target of $95

\- has shown good growth and earnings 

\- their merger with Aetna will help drive more customers to the stores for their in-store clinics

**CVS Cons:**

\- could see a similar drop in traffic due to covid vaccine demands going down after summer

\- There are talks of Amazon moving into the pharmacy business but not sure how much of a threat that would pose and how realistic that is

While I do believe there's still plenty of hype to fuel that niche, longer-term, I still feel oncology is where it's at right now. Obviously, small cap biotech stocks are exciting, high risk, etc. But look at some of the companies that [this article points out](https://pennystocks.com/featured/2021/07/07/hot-smallcap-stocks-watch-potential-cancer-breakthroughs/) and what's happened in as little as 8-18 months alone.

FATE: under $20 last year to over $120 highs this year

LGND: under $80 in Q4 last year to over $215 highs this year &amp; still over $120 this week

BEAM: under $20 last year to over $130 this month &amp; still over $100 even after pulling back

ZLAB: under $75 to over $190 highs this year and still up over $160 right now.

Even the bigger dogs like MRK is kicking it real nice right now even with the XBI ETF getting smacked.

I like the data presented on oncology drug revenue being a huge driver for the sector right now too and I'll highlight this passage:

In Deloitte’s 2021 Global Life Sciences Outlook\*, the data is even more compelling in favor of oncology companies. The firm states that “Beyond vaccines, oncology is expected to continue to be a major driver of the sector’s topline growth in 2021. Oncology accounts for six out of the 10 biggest new sales generators and four of the top 10 bestselling products. According to Evaluate, sales of COVID-19 vaccines though are expected to reach US$10 billion to US$15 billion in 2021, with the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine forecast to be the top seller. Evaluate predicts that Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine will be the market leader by 2026.”

Deloitte’s data clearly demonstrates the size and scope of cancer treatments. Merk’s (NYSE: MRK) Keytruda – a cancer drug – is expected to be a $2.7 Billion drug in 2021 as far as new sales are concerned. It’s further supported by expectations of more than $16 billion in 2021 sales, overall. Bristol Myers Squibb’s (NYSE: BMY) Revlimid and Opdivo are expected to do a combined $21.5 Billion this year. You’ve also got Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) &amp; Abbvie’s (NYSE: ABBV) Imbruvica, which EvaluatePharma expects 2021 sales to come in at $7.6 Billion.

There are chart images in there too showing that the majority of the ""Biggest selling drugs in 2021"" and the ""Biggest new sales generators: Products"" in 2021 are dominated by cancer treatments.

My point: I think it's time to find new opportunities for oncology treatment stocks. There's a hot M&amp;A climate, lots of money floating in the market post-covid, and plenty of proof points to look at for reference.  Can't complain about a 5-10x in less than a year here haha.

&gt;Regulators in Beijing are planning rule changes that would allow them to block a Chinese company from listing overseas even if the unit selling shares is incorporated outside China, closing a loophole long-used by the country’s technology giants, according to people familiar with the matter.  
&gt;  
&gt;The China Securities Regulatory Commission is leading efforts to revise rules on overseas listings that have been in effect since 1994 and make no reference to companies registered in places like the Cayman Islands, said the people, asking not to be identified discussing a private matter. Once amended, the rules would require firms structured using the so-called Variable Interest Entity model to seek approval before going public in Hong Kong or the U.S., the people said.  
&gt;  
&gt;The proposed change is the first indication of how Beijing plans to implement a crackdown on overseas listings flagged by the country’s State Council on Tuesday. Closer oversight would plug a gap that’s been used for two decades by technology giants from [Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.](https://archive.ph/o/J3w9m/https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/BABA:US) to [Tencent Holdings Ltd.](https://archive.ph/o/J3w9m/https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/700:HK) to attract foreign capital and list offshore, potentially thwarting the ambitions of firms like ByteDance Ltd. [contemplating](https://archive.ph/o/J3w9m/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-20/bytedance-founder-zhang-yiming-steps-down-as-ceo-ahead-of-ipo) going public outside the mainland.  
&gt;  
&gt;It would also threaten a lucrative line of business for Wall Street banks and add to concerns of a decoupling between China and the U.S. in sensitive areas like technology. Chinese firms have raised about $76 billion through first-time share sales in the U.S. over the past decade.  
&gt;  
&gt;The changes are subject to approval by the State Council, the people said. The securities regulator plans to discuss potential revisions with firms that underwrite share sales, one of the people said. The CSRC didn’t immediately respond to a fax seeking comment. Bloomberg News [reported](https://archive.ph/o/J3w9m/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-07/china-is-said-to-mull-tighter-rules-for-firms-listing-overseas) on the potential tightening in May.  
&gt;  
&gt;Pioneered by Sina Corp. and its investment bankers during a 2000 initial public offering, the [VIE framework](https://archive.ph/o/J3w9m/https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/quicktake/chinas-fraught-ipos) has never been formally endorsed by Beijing. It has nevertheless enabled Chinese companies to sidestep restrictions on foreign investment in sensitive sectors including the Internet industry. The structure allows a Chinese firm to transfer profits to an offshore entity -- registered in places like the Cayman Islands or the British Virgin Islands -- with shares that foreign investors can then own.  
&gt;  
&gt;While virtually every major Chinese internet company has used the structure, it’s become increasingly worrisome for Beijing as it tightens its grip on technology firms that have infiltrated every corner of Chinese life and control reams of consumer data. Authorities so far have little legal recourse to prevent sensitive overseas listings, as with the recent [Didi Global Inc.](https://archive.ph/o/J3w9m/https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/DIDI:US) IPO, which went ahead despite requests for a [delay](https://archive.ph/o/J3w9m/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-06/china-s-cyber-watchdog-asked-didi-to-delay-ipo-on-data-concerns) from regulators.  
&gt;  
&gt;The additional oversight could bestow a level of legitimacy on the VIE structure that’s been a perennial worry for global investors given the shaky legal ground on which it stands.  
&gt;  
&gt;China’s heightened regulatory scrutiny is echoed by tightening in the U.S. Recent [legislation](https://archive.ph/o/J3w9m/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-18/trump-signs-bill-that-could-remove-china-stock-listings-in-u-s) requires companies listed on U.S. bourses to allow inspectors to review their financial audits. China has long resisted letting the U.S. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board examine audits of firms whose shares trade in America, citing national security interests.  
&gt;  
&gt;The State Council [said](https://archive.ph/o/J3w9m/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-06/china-vows-to-ramp-up-scrutiny-of-data-at-listed-companies) Tuesday that rules for overseas listings will be revised while publicly-traded firms will be held accountable for keeping their data secure. China will also step up its regulatory oversight of companies trading in offshore markets, it said.  
&gt;  
&gt;Under the revised rules, VIEs like Alibaba that have already gone public may need approval for additional share offerings in the offshore market, according to the people familiar.  
&gt;  
&gt;The “political compromise” that allowed the VIE structure as a way around foreign ownership restrictions is “under serious threat,” said Martin Chorzempa, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, following the State Council’s statement. China “can now discourage its promising firms from listing abroad, which could boost its ambitions to develop financial markets on the mainland.”  
&gt;  
&gt;One firm has already suspended its work helping two Chinese companies using the VIE structure to list overseas after being advised by regulatory officials that new rules are being put in place, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.  
&gt;  
&gt;In recent days, China has intensified its crackdown on technology firms with the cyberspace regulator announcing a probe into Didi and pulling the company’s app from stores. Shares in Didi, which controls almost the entire ride-hailing market in China, plunged 20% in U.S. trading just days after a $4.4 billion IPO.",China Considers Closing Loophole Used by Tech Giants for U.S. IPOs (Article in comments),1625647302

stocks,"I am sick and tired of seeing pump and dump posts on BABA and the likes. For the last time, valuation metrics like PE ratio, EBIT, sales do not mean anything if those FCF will never go to investors. The fact that these companies are ""undervalued"" and flushed with cash without any plan for buyback or dividend mean that management do not view its share as having great value. Worse yet, foreign investors receiving dividend might set off the CCP into more crackdown on these companies.

There is no sense in applying traditional metrics that works in the US with a robust judicial system to Chinese companies. What happen if CCP decide to delist Didi or BABA tomorrow without compensating US investors or give them token amount? Are you going to a Chinese court for that? Good luck. FYI, most of the Chinese public (which is quite nationalistic) would cheer any such move of taking money away from Westerners as payback for the Century of Humiliations. China is not the US; you will never see the Chinese Supreme Court ordering Xi to hand over documents like SCOTUS did to Nixon. 

For stocks like these that have a real chance of going to zero, there is no point in using traditional metrics because the underlying fundamentals have been decoupled from its price. It's like the reverse image of TSLA (which also has its stock price decoupled from fundamentals in the opposite direction). Trade Chinese stocks; do not own them.

“Our vision is to help create a waste-free, pollution-free world using biotechnology and engineered systems to degrade contaminants and epicycle waste.” 

The merger is set to take place in q3 (between now and September 2021). New ticker will be $DNA 

I’ve been watching the chart for weeks, and this week gave me confirmation on a move. Here’s the breakout by the way: https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NASDAQ-SRNG/

Let’s get to the trade:
$SRNG July 16 10C
OI 33K - yes, 33,000 (https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SRNG/options/)

These contracts are trading at 5-10 cents per share, or for 1 contract (100 shares), thats 5-10 dollars. This would change depending on share price, demand etc.

Daily volume for the last few weeks continues to be in the thousands, occasionally, hundreds

Delta 0.5

Gamma about 2 (TD ameritrade)

IV 6 percent - providing low premium

Current price is 10.02 based on AH trading. Some whale just bought 1.75M 
shares ABOVE NAV (PIPE got in at 10.0).

Above NAV, risk reward for the arb traders becomes non-existent. Unit volume continues to dry out as that trade slows

Consistently seeing bids above 10 the last 2 days supporting the price.

Calls are ITM, and almost at break-even level.

Chart is showing a breakout.

We can talk about $SRNG valuation till blue in the face.

$SRNG name will be changed to $DNA after the merger, but none of that matters, all else equal, other than the fucking CEO talking about bringing dinosaurs back.

If a call is to be sold, and fully hedged, that means the dealer buys 100 shares, providing buying pressure, which is far more likely to happen when the call has a strike that’s ATM/ITM, and especially when that gamma is already very high.

I’ve been looking at options throughout the market, and I can’t find a gamma on an option like this anywhere else on the market.

Criteria for a move:

Low IV on contracts - check

Options with a low premium (low risk) trading with a high OI, providing liquidity - check

Options trading ITM so that they need to be hedged - check

TD Ameritrade, Unusual Whales, and other accounts tracking options flow - check

Almost non-existent put volume, no one is betting for this shit to go down, and why would they? - check

Whale buying above NAV - 1.75M shares bought after hours at 10.03 on Friday. - check

Risks:
Not enough movement or confidence in the trade, trade flag or down

Can lose what you put in
People who have been wanting to unload, may sell shares as the price goes
Shares outstanding: 172.5M
If 5000 people buy 50 calls, shares that need to be bought to hedge - 25M shares (assuming they cover fully, which they would ITM) about 14% of the shares float

If 50,000 people buy 50 calls, shares that need to be bought to hedge - 250M shares (assuming they cover fully, which they would ITM) about 144% of the float

These are just ballpark numbers. A whale could buy a lot, etc.

**** KEY POINT Per 13F, the institutional shares held us https://whalewisdom.com/stock/srngu - 117M. Now that’s on the units. It IS 1:1. So we can assume that 117M was held on shares too, that could have changed now, but with an institutional ownership of 117/172.5 (67%), which it may no longer be after DA. If that’s still nearly true, that reduces the “retail” float significantly. Not that tutes CANT sell, but they are looking to invest, NOT trade. Much less buying pressure would be required to move the stock, since they will be sitting tight

Additional value: If it moons, people will realize the company has the same name as the same stupid shit your grandma takes to help her memory, Ginkgo. Meme

Easy Sheet: 1 call contract = 10 dollars

So what could it payout?

According to options profit calculator: Stock price = 11; 1 call contract = 100 dollars, 10x Stock price = 15; 1 call contract = 500 dollars, 50x Stock price = 20: 1 call contract = 1000 dollars, 100x Stock price = 30; 1 call contract = 2000 dollars, 200x

TLDR: July 10C, high volume, high OI (33K) low premium, low IV/risk, high reward/potential, dealers hedge since all this shit is ITM

Disclaimer: Do your DD. This is an idea. Investing is risky and you can lose everything. I am not a financial advisor. This is not financial advice. Robinhood sucks

Position: 4800+ shares, 900+ warrants, 75+ calls. I’m green on the trade

stocks,"I wanted to let everyone know there is an exact formula where you could tell if you overpaid for this stock, relative to its own history, relative to the market, and relative to the peers. Before I do this, I want to remind you I am not telling you what to do and I am not trying to talk down your security. These are facts, not opinions, and if you are upset about the facts, it is not my fault. It is your choice if you still decide to stay in the security or not. I also remind you that I do not control stock prices, bidders do, so just because fair value is far below doesn't mean it will ever hit that valuation as long as someone is willing to bid. For instance, and I dont think this will cause alot of anger, AMZN based on my evaluation is worth about $1,400..... It trades at $3,000+ but may never drop as long as someone is willing to bid.

**My own rule and this is my own no one says this or tells me this. Do not buy a company with 0 PE, a company that loses money (Bottom Line) Unless revenues/sales is growing at least 50% year over year (Top Line)** This is not to say that you can not make money on a company that loses money and has slower growth, I personally will pass and not take the risk.

So let's get into this and use company's that everyone knows. For each sector I will choose 3 different companies. Instead of boring you with all the exact top, bottom line numbers I am just telling you, ""**How to tell if I overpaid for my stock or I got a steal! Relative to that stock, relative to the stock market and relative to the sector""** By the way this isn't some made up theory or mumbo jumbo or some formula that analysts use to reinforce their sales targets. So please focus and pay attention. I will cover 2 sectors, 3 companies in these 2 sectors. You can do this for free yourself I am going to tell you how.

Banks

Banks are relatively stable, pay dividends, usually have steady earnings, sales and are usually a great conservative sector. **I like to use Morningstar, you can can probably get the information in many places but I am a creature of habit I have traded since 1995.**

The first bank I will look at is C Citigroup, 2/26/2021, Closing price of $66, PE ratio 13.52, EPS 4.87. These details are very important because I am trying to tell you how you can tell if you overpaid for this stock now, relative to its past, the market and its peers. **I go on morningstar, I type in the symbol, (By the way I am not going to tell you step by step for these 6 securities, this first 1 and thats it!!! Hopefully, you get the idea)** I then click on financials. Quickly I see a bunch of ratios, revenue growth, return on equity. I am telling you I love this site, if they were to charge me $20 a month I would pay it, but shhhh don't tell them. I then scroll down and I see 2017, 2018, 2019 and I see year to date. Now I do own JPM, and that will be discussed shortly, I dont want the reader to think there is any bias I am just telling you how to read this. I immediately see how slow the growth it is, it seems less then 5% (Top Line), Bottom Line EPS went up gradually as well. What does that mean? If last year you paid above $60 a share you are still getting a pretty good deal relative to itself because top line, bottom line does show some appreciation. There are other factors I am telling you a quick way. Relative to the market (S&amp;P) that is easy because the PE is 13.52 and it trades cheaper then the index (banks relatively do). Finally, is this a good buy or should I look at BAC or the leader (We pay a higher premium, multiple for industry leaders) JPM.

BOA Bank of America 34.71, PE ratio 18.55 EPS 1.87. Immediately you see sales and earnings are pretty much the same. So this should not be higher than it was last year, you can than check the chart. The numbers do not merit this 18.55 multiple. So if it was cheaper, I am sorry it should be! If you are holding BAC I am not saying sell, but you are now paying higher than last year. S&amp;P as we said, banks trade lower. Relative to C, I would buy C based on the fundamentals because their is more growth in top and bottom lines and it trades lower!!!

The Industry leader, many of us pay a premium and if it has a higher multiple you just pay for it, its natural. I do own it

JPM Chase, 115.08, PE ratio 34, EPS 3.38, Sales have gradually gone up but earnings have gone down, me personally, (and I do have it long term), after seeing these fundamentals if the next quarter they do not beat by a lot I would get out, there is a drop off in earnings and it has this PE.....I don't know exactly what it traded a year ago, but it deserves to be lower, so definitely do not pay more. This is the leader so trades above the SP. Relative to the peers and a drop off of earnings, I personally would not get in, it is trading at a higher premium and I am not sure if it deserves it.

**If you have a stock and you are unsure of its peers, go on yahoo finance type in the symbol and it usually shows you peers on the far right, it is important to see how it trades compared to its peers. Which I am going over on this next sector.**

**Finally it is very hard to use any formula for a company in the red, losing money because how can you calculate what you should pay for a loser!!**

Automobiles

Usually these are safe, have high debt though and have multiples near 10-15 because the debt and slowing growth.

F Ford 11.70, PE ratio 11, EPS 1.06, Sales are down and so is earnings. So relative to itself, and its trading near highs (I do own it) I would not add, last year about this time it was 8-9. People are paying a higher premium on EV and expect future... possible but the current numbers do not. Car's trade lower than SP. Lets see to its peers

GM General Motors 51.33, PE ratio 11.85 EPS 4.33, Sales are also down and earnings as well... So this is the same story and traders are paying a premium based on it's past hoping for a better future. SP same story and relative to F i would say these are trading about the same.

Industry leader

TM Toyota 147.93, PE ratio 12.11, EPS 12.21 Sales are actual even and earnings are actually up, I would say that this is actually cheap, so if you like TM this is a good entry point. Also, this is the leader and deserves a high PE. Relative to its peers, TM is much better, not even by a little.

**Summary if it is too long:**

Good company but future outlook is bleak.

**Summary of operations:**

They are a communications company.  They own a large number of television stations in the United States, with 24% coverage.

* They own 94 television stations
* Sales predominantly come from advertising online and on broadcast as well as some sort of retransmission fees.
* They are the largest owner of “top rated” local TV stations (See revenue breakdown).

They operate in many markets, predominately in eastern United states.  Two operating areas account for 8% of the companies revenues, so they have a diverse range of operating environments.  Here are the revenues generated from the 'big four' and from other:

* CBS accounts for 36% of revenues
* NBC accounts for 32% of revenues
* ABC … 14%
* Fox … 10%
* Other … 8%

Agreements with the big 4 are set to expire in December 2023, so they must be renewed before that date.  They operate in a wide range of Designated market areas (15-209) ([SEE HERE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_market)), and have potential to move in to the top 15.  70/94 of their stations were #1 in overall viewership in their respective markets.  There are a number of recognized risks, and they are discussed in their 10K in more depth than most.  CEO, CFO, general management seems competent.

Financial analysis:

Most revenue comes from retransmission costs.  Local news coverage is the second largest cluster.  Most of their liabilities are in the form of LTD.  Net income is growing.  Their finances are quite simple, and seem to be fundamentally strong.  Here is a comparison to GTN and the broadcasting industry:

|Metric|Industry AVG|$GTN|

:--|:--|:--|

|P/E|39.16|5.51|

|P/S|3.91|0.81|

|P/B|4.3|1.09|

|P/C|16.07|2.5|

|P/FCF|43.46|3.57|

|EPS Growth, 5y|16.32%|45.3%|

|Sales growth, 5y|21.67%|31.9%|

|Market Cap|8b|1.9B|

&amp;#x200B;

GTN clearly has some market potential, but is likely underpriced because it is tapping into an industry that will soon be overtaken by purely internet stations.  How many of us are going to pay for cable in 20 years? Probably none.

Opinion:

Sure, there is good value here.  But they are operating traditional television stations.  They are well connected and have financial health, but there is more future risk than reward.  I would give them a sell rating.",Gray television DD {$GTN},1625610698

TD good and strong

**Long Version:**

TD:

TD is the sixth largest bank in north America. They have over 26 million customers. Their main operations are:

* Canadian retail (TD Canada trust, TD auto finance Canada, TD wealth Canada, td direct investing and TD insurance)
* American retail (TD bank, TD auto finance US, TD wealth US)
* TD securities

They have 14m online customers and 1.7t in assets. They implemented a deferral program which worked quite well in 2020. 25% of Canadian lending accounts took part in this program in April, and by late October, there were only 2.2 percent of accounts still participating. This likely artificially depressed some financial values such as cash flows, interest payments and accounts receivable which could have been reflected by a lower price, justified if one is speculating but truly an artificial value as loans return to normal. This program accounted for 45.7b in loans. Similar results were seen in America, with 11.9b in loans, representing 21% of accounts in April later transitioning to 5.2% of accounts. This is not as attractive as Canadian accounts, but is only 25% of the size, and a tiny fraction of balance sheet items, as well as having a shorter deferral period.

The bank recently carried out what they call the Schwab transaction, where they acquired 13.5% of the Schwab corporation. This transaction is healthy, and Schwab has about 80% of its market cap covered in cash alone, as well as 6b in FCF for a 120b cap.

TD has managed to increase revenue and net income in 2020. They allocated more capital for credit losses, but managed to pay less taxes likely in light of the current economic and societal situation.

**Business segment overview:**

They have 16m customers in Canada. This is almost half of the population, which likely will have a monopolizing effect. They have credit cards, auto finance services, business banking, merchant solutions, asset management services, and an insurance business in Canada. In the United States they have personal/business banking, and TD ameritrade.

They operate a wholesale banking segment which operates like any investment bank. This segment operates under the TD securities brand.

There is a vast segment called the corporate segment which does a number of different operations. These operations include technology solutions, shared services, treasury and balance sheet management (asset management?), marketing, human resources, finance risk management, compliance \[management\], legal, anti-money laundering, and ?other? Operations. It seems quite difficult to find information on this segment, other than it has a margin of about -20%, making it even more curious.

Segment analysis:

All segments other than corporate are profitable, and have similar margins around 25%.

Canadian retail has seen slight increases every year since 2018. Net income in this segment has been declining. A decrease in personal banking revenue by 750m was countered by a 200m increase in business banking, a 400m increase in wealth banking, and a 250m increase in insurance, resulting in increased revenue from 2019 to 2020. There is quite a high ROE for this segment.

US retail has seen stable, cyclical revenues with a macro up trend. Net income significantly dropped in 2020. Deposits grew in personal and business banking and in sweep. The ROE in this segment is significantly lower than in the Canadian retail segment.

In wholesale banking, there was a sharp increase in revenue and in net income. This segment has a ROE of 16.9. They were a part of a number of large name broker actions, acting as an intermediary. They carry out some trading, research, underwriting, securitization, trade finance, cash management, brokerage, and trade execution services in their global markets segment. In the corporate/investment banking sector they do corporate lending, debt/equity underwriting and advisory services.

The corporate segment is a number of service and control groups. It seems to manage tax items, treasury and balance sheet activities, and some other shady sounding operations. It seems like this segment manages some accounting, as well as some issuance of equities/debt equities.

The balance sheet is very large. There was a $300 billion increase from 2019-20. This was mostly related to a large increase in deposits. The bank has 718b in loans. Of these, only about 2b were stage three. Factoring in allowance for credit loss, there is a possible delinquency rate just below 2 percent at around 12b which is covered 15 times over by cash alone. With most liabilities in deposits, there is no immediate concern in the balance sheet. There are almost 200b in securities sold under repurchase agreements, which will be evaluated over at least 5 years, presenting again little threat.

The loans can be broken down into regional and segmental sections. Canadian residential mortgages account for 213billion of the loans. Mortgage delinquency rates in Canada are 0.23% as of Jan 31, 2021. This equates to about 212.5b in real value from the mortgage loans, although TD has allocated about 100 million less than I recommend. HELOCs account for another adjusted 95 billion. All together, personal loans account for 369.256b on the balance sheet. Conservatively taking delinquencies at 1b, this figure is adjusted to 268.256b for analytical purposes. Real estate represents about 40 billion in Canadian loans, and assorted business and government is another 115.2b, predominantly in the financial and consumer staples industries. All of these loans look healthy at first glance.

United states loans are similar. There are 100b in personal loans, 35.4b in real estate, and 148.3 in business and government with a similar allocation as the corresponding Canadian section under the same name. There is 9b in other international loans. The total is about 734.9b. There is about a 5.3 percent average increase YOY in pure volume of loans.

TD decisively estimates that 1.3b of loans are in stage 3, which may be a little conservative for most analysts. Preparing for up to one percent delinquency is in order because of the recent volatility in the market right now as well as in the Canadian economy as an expected third wave of Covid-19 expands its grasp. In table 33 of the 2020 annual report, they allocate 7 billion to credit losses which is much more reasonable because they account for stage 1 and 2 as well. In this time of great uncertainty, it is not unreasonable to change this estimate to 20b. The bank has apparent backing from the Canadian government so there is no immediate threat to allocate a tenth of capital reserves to delinquencies.",Toronto Dominion Bank {$TD} due diligence,1625606834
stocks,"Google analytics

Comparing the popularity of the google searches, using the insights query found [here](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;q=scotiabank,bmo,td,rbc,cibc), it is clear that TD is most searched for.  The focus of this research will be the Canadian markets, but it is important to consider the distribution of searches worldwide.  In Mexico, there is a heavy concentration of searches for Scotiabank.  In the US, TD dominates searches, as well as in the UK.  RBC and TD are both around 45% of searches in India.  There is an extreme concentration of searches for Scotiabank in Peru, and it is the only instance where there are more searches than in Canada for all 5 banks.  Overall, the relative distribution over 14 years is this:

Fig.1

|Bank|Average Interest over time, google searches (Index)|
|:-|:-|
|TD|79|
|RBC|36|
|Scotiabank|24|
|CIBC|21|
|BMO|20|

&amp;#x200B;

This doesn't tell us much other than that TD is likely present in the US at some scale, as well as Scotiabank in Peru.

Most data from Finviz, specifically from this query: [finviz.com](https://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=111&amp;f=cap_largeover,fa_pfcf_u5,geo_canada,ind_banksdiversified&amp;ft=4)

All five banks have managed to keep their Price/FCF below five, even during the post Covid bubble.  This forces a deeper analysis to be carried out.  Amazingly, all of their P/E ratios fall between 12 and 15.  The figure below corresponds to these values.

Fig 2.

&amp;#x200B;

|Bank|P/E|Price/FCF|
|:-|:-|:-|
|TD|12.66|0.59|
|RBC|14.59|1.18|
|Scotiabank|14.50|2.31|
|CIBC|13.65|1|
|BMO|13.99|1.28|
|Average|13.878|1.272|

Now a difference between a P/E or P/FCF of 2 is not grounds for elimination from consideration for almost any cases. However, it should be noted that TD appears to be the most favorable from these preliminary figures.

The next three values to be analyzed relate to earnings and sales.  Here, we start to see some differences between the banks, with TD managing to grow earnings significantly more than the other banks in the past 5 years.

Fig 3.

|Bank|P/S|EPS growth last 5y|Sales growth past 5y|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Scotiabank|3.36|\-1.30%|7.9%|
|RBC|5.22|3.1%|8.9%|
|BMO|4.46|2.8%|12.1%|
|CIBC|3.43|\-1.5%|8.8%|
|TD|4.58|8.8%|7.5%|
|Average|4.21|2.38%|9.04%|

&amp;#x200B;

TD is a clear winner in this section.  It would be ideal to bring the P/S down, but because the P/FCF is so high for all of the banks, it is not a worry.  TD is the only bank managing to become more efficient as they scale, which potentially shows an effective management team, or increasingly more profitable businesses, or both.  It is possible that the earnings increase may be a result of a lack of attention to other obligations or competitive endeavors, which could possibly hurt them in the future. CIBC and Scotiabank have managed to decrease earnings as they have increased sales, possibly hinting at ineffective management, or defective operations.  It is also possible that the lower earnings are a result of restructuring, which could be positive in the future.  All of these values will have to be analyzed much closer.

The analyst does suggest that a new measure be conceived to gauge growth sustainability.  The value would be determined by dividing EPS growth over a period, x, over Sales growth, over that same period, x.  The measure could be called the income growth sustainability measure, and is formatted as follows:

IGSM = EPS growth in the past x  / Sales growth in the past x years

Where at least one value must be positive for the calculation to be effective.  The value produced is unitless  The ideal value is 1, and deviations outside the range of 0.5 and1.5 are to be considered unsustainable.  This value is only rough estimate, and would have to be refactored t in order to be used commercially because it produces inaccurate values the further you stray from 1 (a value of 2 is clearly unsustainably, as well as a value of-1 with positive earnings).  Using the newly constructed equation, the figure below can be constructed.

Fig 4.

&amp;#x200B;

|Bank|IGSM|
|:-|:-|
|TD|1.17|
|RBC|0.34|
|Scotiabank|0.16|
|CIBC|\-0.17|
|BMO|0.23|

Again, TD clearly has the most sustainable growth.  An average is not computed here because of the nature of this value, and it will not be used to determine any conclusions.  A better evaluation of sustainable growth must be formulated.

No securities analysis is complete without analyzing the balance sheet.  All of the companies have a P/Cash ratio between 0.23-0.25, so those values do not need to be discussed on a relative basis.  Current ratios, D/E measures, and P/B are considered in the following figure.  Some of this information has to be sourced from [SEDAR](http://www.sedar.com/).  Just press “ctrl f” and type in “annual” to get to the reports.  Other data is from [Macrotrends](https://www.macrotrends.net/), probably the best source of long term information on the internet.

Fig 5.

|Bank|Current ratio|Debt to equity|Price to book|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|TD|0.93|0.13|1.68|
|RBC|0.90|0.11|2.02|
|Scotiabank|1.05|0.41|1.49|
|CIBC|1.03|0.12|1.46|
|BMO|0.98|0.14|1.42|
|Average|0.98|0.182|1.614|

All of the values, except for RBCs P/B and Scotiabanks debt to equity fall within range of their peers.  Objectively, these values are ridiculously strong, but nonetheless, we are looking for a winner among winners.

The last rudimentary fundamentals to be considered are some alternative financial ratios that work best when relatively compared.  This is the largest section.  We will be looking at all of the ROx’s, as well as PM and OM.

Fig 6. |Bank|ROE|ROI|ROA|Operating Margin|Profit margin| :--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--| |TD|13.50%|5.20%|0.70%|56.90%|36.30%| |RBC|14.30%|4.00%|0.70%|60.00%|36.10%| |Scotiabank|10.40%|17.30%|0.60%|51.20%|23.50%| |CIBC|10.90%|16.00%|0.50%|54.30%|25.40%| |BMO|10.30%|5.40%|0.50%|59.10%|24.20%| |Average|11.88%|9.58%|0.6%|56.3%|29.10%|

For the returns, Scotiabank and CIBC slightly ahead of the other three because of their exceptionally high ROI.  For operating margins, RBC and BMO are slightly above average, where Scotiabank is lagging behind.  TD and RBC have exceptionally higher profit margins.

Culminating the rudimentary analysis is a large comparison of Figures 2-6, excluding 4.  For each figure, a “winner” can be determined, and a “loser” can be determined.  Here are the overall rankings for each figure.

For figure 2, TD is the most attractive in both fields.  CIBC is the second most attractive for both fields.  The first two fall below the average P/E, but because of the limited deviation between banks, this is not a huge accomplishment.  The next two rankings are subjective.  BMO and RBC are tied for third.  Their percent difference between PEs and P/FCFs are quite similar for both of them, and each value carries similar importance.  Scotiabank is fourth

In figure three,  TD is again the winner.  Their sustainable growth is extremely attractive, despite having a higher P/S than the average.  BMO is second for the same reasons, and RBC is third because of their high P/S.  Scotiabank and CIBC are tied for fourth because they both have similar P/S ratios and their Sales growth to eps growth are similar.

For figure 5, CIBC is the slight winner.  Most values are very similar, but CIBC is in the top two for all categories.  Second is BMO, lagging slightly behind CIBC with their CR and D/E, but winning the P/B category.  Third is TD.  Fourth is RBC because of their higher than average P/B.  Last is scotiabank with the highest D/E ratio despite having stronger values in other fields.  Scotiabank is in last because this value is almost four times the next highest D/E, whereas the highest P/B is only \~25% greater than the best P/B ratio.

In judging figure 6, a higher priority is placed on profit margin.  Giving equal weighting to ROE, ROI and ROA, TD is the winner of figure 6.  RBC is very close behind.  CIBC is third, and Scotiabank is fourth.  BMO is last.

Fig 7. The results of the preliminary relative analysis

|Bank|Figure 2 ranking|Fig 3 ranking|Fig 5 ranking|Fig 6 ranking|Overall|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|TD|1|1|3|1|1|
|RBC|=3|3|4|2|3|

Clearly, TD was the most attractive followed by CIBC.

Market analysis.  Data is mostly from [stockhouse](https://stockhouse.com/).

This section will analyze more sensitive factors of each company, such as short position, large and insider transactions, volatility, and other factors related to the current situation of the company.  It will be split into individual sections for each bank, as well as a composite section comparing some factors.

Lets begin with TD.  TD has a market cap of 150 billion, which is quite large for even american companies.  Their beta is 0.9, which will hopefully draw speculation away.  They have a dividend yield of 3.825%.  Not a lot of insider information is available, but most insiders have historically bought below 60 and sold at 70.  The current price is 65, but is extremely attractive.

|Bank|Market cap|Beta|Yield|Short interest|Sales|Assets|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|TD|150.24b|0.9|3.825%|0.33%|43b|1.7t|

BMO has a market cap of 74 billion, just about half that of TD.  They have a beta of 1.17, which is higher than desired.  They have a yield of 3.71% and a short interest of 0.59%.  Their yield is slightly lower than TD, despite having the higher beta.  Recent insider purchases have been below $90, and a number of sales have happened above 100.

|Bank|Market cap|Beta|Yield|Short interest|Sales|Assets|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|BMO|74b|1.17|3.71|0.59%|25b|0.95t|

CIBC has a market cap of 59 billion.  Their beta is 1, and their yield is 3.34.  Short interest is 0.98%.  There have been a number of insider sales above 100, and insider purchases below this number.

|Bank|Market cap|Beta|Yield|Short interest|Sales|Assets|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|CIBC|59b|1|3.34|0.98%|18b|0.73t|

RBC has a market cap of 134 billion.  Their beta is 0.79, which makes them quite attractive if considering their dividend. Their yield is 3.34.  Short interest is 0.34%. The buy/sell line is at around 80 for insiders.

|Bank|Market cap|Beta|Yield|Short interest|Sales|Assets|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|RBC|134b|0.79|3.64|0.34%|47b|1.62t|

Scotiabank has a market cap of 74 billion.  Their beta is 0.79, which makes them quite attractive if considering their dividend. Their yield is 3.34.  Short interest is 0.34%.  Scotiabanks buy/sell line is around 75 with a lot of deviation.

|Bank|Bank|Market cap|Market cap|Beta|Beta|Yield|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Yield|Short interest|Short interest|Sales|Sales|Assets|Assets|
|Overall|Scotiabank|TD|74b|150.24b|0.85|0.9|
|4.64|3.825%|0.34%|0.33%|31b|43b|1.14t|
|1.7t|3|BMO|74b|1.17|3.71%|0.59%|
|25b|0.95t|5|Scotiabank|74b|0.85|4.64%|
|0.34%|31b|1.14t|1|RBC|134b|0.79|
|3.64%|0.34%|47b|1.62t|2|CIBC|59b|

|98b|0.942|3.83|0.516|32.8b|1.23t||

All five institutions have some attractive things and some ugly things in this table, relatively speaking.  Scotiabank's yield is offset by the low ranking it got in the previous relative analysis.  TD has the most attractive yield other than that, and the low short interest is reassuring.  RBCs low beta is very attractive, as well as their large sales and massive asset pool.  They are the second most attractive entry in the table after Scotiabank.  TD is third at a relatively neutral position.  CIBC is fourth and BMO is fifth because of BMOs large beta.

stocks,"App downloads of the major virtual MVPDs were up 63% in June, most likely driven by heavy sports content and the run up to the Summer Olympic Games in Tokyo, according to a report by Evercore ISI media analyst Vijay Jayant.

YouTube TV again accounted for the largest slice of overall vMVPD downloads -- 44% -- but it was sports-centric FuboTV that had the biggest year-over-year gain in the segment --312%, according to Jayant. FuboTV was a close second to YouTube TV in terms of download share (33%), followed by Sling TV (18%) and AT&amp;T TV (9%).

Virtual MVPD app download trends improved vs. the prior few months likely driven by the strong sports calendar and lead into the Olympics. May downloads rose 11% year-over-year, driven by FuboTV and YouTube TV. 

Similar to trends in prior months, YouTube continues to dominate in terms of vMVPD download market share followed by fuboTV, SlingTV, and AT&amp;T TV.

Some of you don't need this post, but some definitely do. The purpose of this post is to shed light on issues with some of wall streets common ratios with profitable but shrinking, deceiving or problematic businesses.

A value trap is when a company looks like a great deal now, but in the past it has had strong fundamentals and the market has never realized this. It's hard to spot a value trap from one or even 5 years of fundamentals. Most become obvious after 5 years.

This happens for a number of reasons. There could be underlying business problems that are not reflected in the current financials like the phasing out of an industry. The company could also lack competitive advantages and are expected to fall father behind in years to come.

Take a look at Macy's (NYSE:M)

There are some obvious ways to fall into this trap. You could look at average earnings ad revenue, and compare it to the current market cap. Wow! pretty obvious discount. Average book value has been pretty good too.

But looking deeper into factors that are not as integrated into the common ratios like massively decreasing operating cash flows. The market outlook for departments stores has been very negative, thus creating a temporary value trap before Macy's business starts to really deteriorate.

(NYSE:SNEX)

One interesting case study is StoneX. They have massive revenues that show up on screeners and financial data websites, but in reality the revenue is recognized through their sales of commodities that are bought and sold StoneX, creating a net revenue from this operation of almost zero when accounting for the capital expenditures for these commodities. This is an example of a deceiver.

These are just some thoughts I have. They may not align with your opinions or they may be outright wrong.

I use [macrotrends.net](https://macrotrends.net/) to quickly look at long term data, but sometimes their data it completely wrong so you can't completely rely on them.

[u/Astronomer\_Soft](https://www.reddit.com/u/Astronomer_Soft/) made a great note on some common fundamentals that value traps have:

Easiest way to spot a value trap. Usually has many of these factors:

1. Generous dividend payout greater than free cash flow.
2. Recent history of declining revenues, profit margins and market share.
3. Lackluster management spouting off nonsense about unrealistic turnaround, restructuring, or acquisition plans.
4. Extremely low return on capital employed (soon to be addressed by massive write-offs of overvalued assets on the balance sheet)
5. Increasing debt, while financing costs of new debt is increasing and maturities getting shorter.

Stocks traded mixed today, with the Nasdaq (QQQ) reaching a fresh intraday high, driven higher by continued strength in mega-cap tech stocks. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) opened at a new all-time high but was unable to hold onto the gains throughout the day and finished modestly lower while the Dow Jones (DIA) fell roughly 0.6%. Each of the major indexes had jumped to fresh record closing highs on Friday, propelled by the June jobs report that showed a healthy pace of recovery in the labor market but that did not suggest an overheating economy. 

Last week,  the US Department of Labor released the Job June report, which showed a stronger-than-expected acceleration in hiring, with non-farm payrolls rising by 850,000, the sixth straight month of gains. The unemployment rate however, ticked slightly higher to 5.9%. Here are the numbers

* **Change in non-farm payrolls:** 850,000 vs. 720,000 expected and an upwardly revised 583,000 in May
* **Unemployment rate:** 5.9% vs. 5.6% expected and 5.8% in May 
* **Average hourly earnings, month-over-month:** 0.3% vs. 0.3% expected and a downwardly revised 0.4% in May
* **Average hourly earnings, year-over-year:** 3.6% vs. 3.6% expected and a downwardly revised 1.9% in May

Oil prices turned lower after recently climbing to a multi-year high amid a breakdown in discussion between the two largest members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates in a gridlock over production cuts. The meeting, whose purpose was to increase output given an increase in demand for energy, yielded no decision. In response, Saudi Arabia raised the August official selling prices of all crude oil it sells to Asia, according to the state’s oil producer Aramco. 

Goldman Sachs analyst Damien Courvalin said, “As negotiations continue, we estimate that most outcomes still implies higher prices in the coming months as the physical market tightens and with higher OPEC production that the group discussed needed by the global oil market next year. Price volatility will likely rise.”

Looking ahead, market participants are waiting for the release of the Federal Open Market Committee's June meeting minutes (basically notes of what was discussed), which will help reveal central bankers' thoughts around adjusting monetary policy as the economic recovery matures. The June meeting had marked a notable shift in the Fed's outlook, with the central bank signaling as many as two rate hikes by 2023. Subsequent public remarks revealed a number of committee members were also warming to the idea of a sooner-rather-than-later move to taper the Fed's crisis-era asset purchase program. In my opinion, it is extremely unlikely that the Fed will signal any acceleration in the timeline regarding interest rates but will not be surprised if more members discussed tapering quantitative easing in the coming months. 

Next week, earnings season for the Q2 kicks off, with big banks scheduled to report first. Earnings are expected to continue being super-charged by stronger than expected demand from savings-laden consumers that are finally emerging from lockdown  thanks to effective distribution of the coronavirus vaccine. So far, analysts are looking for S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 61.9% year-on-year in aggregate, according to FactSet data – an estimate UBS's Head of Equity Derivatives Research Stuart Kaiser said may still be ""need to be revised higher."" This would mark the fastest pace of earnings growth since Q4 of 2009. 

**Highlights**

* Pentagon officials announced they terminated Microsoft’s massive $10 billion Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure (JEDI) cloud-computing contract and said they would start fresh with a new project, putting an end to a yearslong initiative that was unpopular in Congress and mired in litigation from Amazon (AMZN). In terminating the contract, officials said they focused largely on technical reasons, saying advances in cloud-computing in recent years have made JEDI obsolete. AMZN stock rocketed up roughly 5% on the news. 
* Grubhub announced it plans to roll out food-delivering robots across US college campuses starting this fall. Seen a lot of reports about the growing influence of automation in deliveries. Recently, Dominos Pizza also announced it was rolling out an automated delivery robot. 
* Lots of news surrounding Chinese ride-hailing giant Didi. Last week, the company went public on Thursday, however, over the weekend the Chinese government, in another crackdown of a large tech company, ordered Didi removed from app stores, citing cybersecurity complaints. Now there are reports coming out that Didi pressed ahead with the IPO despite the CCP suggesting the company delay due to “security concerns”. Shares were down roughly 19%. 
* The Chairman of Weibo, which is basically like the Twitter of China, and a state investor are reportedly in talks to take the company private in a deal worth $20 billion and help facilitate the exit of major shareholder Alibaba (BABA). A lot of news coming out of China regarding big technology companies. 
* Ford Motor (F), which has probably been hurt the worst by the recent chip-shortage, said it only has 162,100 trucks and cars in dealer inventories, half what it was three months ago and roughly one-quarter the stock the company usually has.

&gt;  
&gt;The JEDI, or Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure, deal has become one of the most tangled contracts for the Department of Defense. In a press release Tuesday, the Pentagon said that “due to evolving requirements, increased cloud conversancy, and industry advances, the JEDI Cloud contract no longer meets its needs.”  
&gt;  
&gt;But the fight over a cloud computing project does not appear to be completely over yet. The Pentagon said in the press release that it still needs enterprise-scale cloud capability and announced a new multi-vendor contract known as the Joint Warfighter Cloud Capability. The agency said it plans to solicit proposals from both Amazon and Microsoft for the contract, adding that they are the only cloud service providers that can meet its needs. But, it added, it will continue to do market research to see if others could also meet its specifications.

  
**Which company do you think will win the contract? willthere be underdog companies challenging the cloud gaints?**

stocks,"I have been following Athenex ($ATNX) for several months now ever since their CRL (Complete Response Letter) from the FDA in regards to their Oral Paclitaxel. For those who don't know, Oral Paclitaxel is used to treat metastatic breast cancer and is a viable alternative (with higher overall response rates) to the standard IV Chemotherapy. Yes, it's never good news to get a CRL on a Phase 3 trial, but there is good news. As of this morning, July 6th, they released news that it had held a Type A meeting with the FDA in which they state, ""the FDA was supportive and encouraged the Company to continue development of oral paclitaxel and encequidar for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer."". In addition, Athenex intends to present a new clinical study to the FDA in Q4 of 2021. What this means is that Athenex will be collaborating very closely with the FDA in regards to getting necessary data for Oral Paclitaxel to be approved.

Additionally, Athenex currently has 13 other treatments in their clinical pipeline, 8 of which are currently in Phase 1+2 trials. Prior to the CRL, the stock was previously trading between $11-$15 which is what I believe it will return to in the coming months. Furthermore, they are nearing completion of their billion dollar manufacturing facility in Dunkirk, NY. It will be the first of its kind to be built in North America in the last 20 years. Moreover, as part of the Buffalo Billion Investment Development Plan, New York state in partnership with NYU has invested $200m towards the development of the facility to help develop and provide high-paying jobs in the western New York. Once completed, it's 409,000 sqft (38000m\^2) facility will be a cornerstone for its commercial manufacturing within the US.

ThreeD Capital Inc. is a publicly-traded Canadian-based venture capital firm focused on opportunistic investments in companies in the junior resources and disruptive technologies sectors. ThreeD’s investment strategy is to invest in multiple private and public companies across a variety of sectors globally.

Lets start at the top with one of the greatest investors in Canadian history, Sheldon Inwentash. Very well-known in the investment community with a long standing reputation for creating great long lasting value for his shareholders. While at Pinetree, his accomplishments included investing in Queenston Mining, which was acquired by Osisko Mining Corp. for $550 million; Aurelian Resources, acquired by Kinross for $1.2 billion; and Gold Eagle Mines, acquired by Goldcorp for $1.5 billion. In 2007, he was also named an Ontario finalist for the Ernst &amp; Young entrepreneur-of-the-year award.

Sheldon founded ThreeD Capital in order to provide a unique investment opportunity for in several industries and sectors, most notably the early stages of small cap disruptive technologies and junior resource and mining company's. The focus tends to be towards precious metals. 

This is not a shocker at all, with all the inflation rumor's and numbers flying around it stands to reason that someone as smart and historically successful as Sheldon would be able to accurately asses the market and what will be profitable before the crowd finally realizes.

Currently, there are some key major investments ThreeD has taken. Most notably Bluesky Digital who has taken the initial investment of $500K all the way to over $5M. If that's not an investment you want to join, I'm not sure what is.

In total, they have investment a full $30M and came out happy  with a current fair value of $60M. Doubling your money with diversified, safe, and consistent profits sounds good to me.

([Link 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m71xi8/a_month_of_tracking_stock_scrapers_for/), [Link 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/n5lead/results_of_30_days_of_tracking_all_reddit/), [Link 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/n5lec2/results_of_30_days_of_tracking_all_reddit/), post history has more)

**\* DISCLAIMER:** I have nothing to do with MillenialBets, I just got tired of updating multiple scraper spreadsheets a day so had to pick the most successful one. I chose MB. They don't have the best data and are pretty bare bones with the categories, but they're very easy to copy/paste into a spreadsheet. So I'll just be talking about them with this post

&amp;#x200B;

So far I've been tracking the data for a few months, although the spreadsheet will only reflect the last 30 days since I delete anything older. This keeps the trends fresh and up-to-date. You can tell that May was a really bullish month because the average returns were 12% with a confidence level of over 95%. Now that I've deleted anything before June 6th the average max returns are 7% with a confidence level of 90%.

What does this mean in english? If you pick the most successful categories you used to have a 95% chance of it going profitable, and the average max returns was 12% in 9 days. Now you have a 90% chance with an average max returns of 7% in 9 days. Since that is the MAX average I usually set my sell point at 5%.

&amp;#x200B;

[Here are some screenshots of how I use the data to determine stock picks](https://imgur.com/gallery/UBBJn3F)

&amp;#x200B;

So what's my success rate so far? Here's my success rate with my real world money over the last 2 weeks:

* Total Buys: **20**
* Total Sells: **15**
* Total Profitable: **14**
* Total Losses: **1**  

* Biggest Profit (shares): **12.75%**
* Biggest Profit (options): **55.51%**
* Smallest Profit (shares): **-12.22%** (I'm setting a new rule for myself that if something drops 3% I sell no matter what. That way a single loss doesn't wipe out multiple gains)
* Smallest Profit (options): **24.55%**
* Average turnaround time: **5.3%**  

* Initial Investment: **$9000**
* Current Total: **$11,914.12**
* Total Profit: **$2914.12**
* Average gain per trade: **$197.27 per trade every 5.3 days**

&amp;#x200B;

It seems the markets cooled down in June and the data is reflecting that. That probably explains why the data didn't hit max peak as often as it could have, even though it was overall very profitable. This means there will always be a little lag between the current market and the one being tracked. I may start deleting any data over 2 weeks old to ensure that the trends are as close to today as possible. It'll be a balancing act though, since I'd have trouble trusting in that little data.",I analyze all those scraper posts and use it to make actual stock picks,1625585638

- Current Dividend Yield is at 3.95%
- 3 year yield average: 3.51%
- Liquidity in the options market

- Collect the 1% quarterly dividend and sell 2 covered calls for Oct 2021 @ 52.50 for $225 per contract.

- If the covered call is exercised, I make $5/share ($1,000) plus $450 on covered calls plus $100 on the dividend (1 quarters worth)
$1550 Profit on a $9500 investment: 16% in 4 months

stocks,"We have all heard it! -- “Time in the market beats timing the market”

At the same time, we are all to some extent guilty of trying to time the market. The market always seems to break some new all-time high records, so we wait for the inevitable crash/pullback to invest. It’s high time we put both strategies to test. Basically, what I wanted to analyze was

**Whether waiting for a crash to invest is a better investment strategy than staying invested?**

**Analysis**

For this, let’s take someone who started investing approximately 3 decades back (1993 to be exact). I created multiple investment scenarios as follows to understand the difference in returns if you

a. Invested at the exact right time when markets were lowest that particular year

b. Was extremely unlucky and just invested at the peak every year

c. Did not care about timing the market and invested at a random date every year

d. Just hoarded his cash and waited for a market crash to invest \[1\]  

For analysis simplicity, let’s assume that you were on a conservative side, never picked individual stocks, and always made your investments to S&amp;P500 \[2\]. For investment amount, consider that you started with investing $10K in 1993 and increased your investments by 5% for every subsequent year. So, you made a total investment of $623K over the last 29 years.  

**Results**

**Investment Returns SP500(1993-2021)**

|**Scenario**|**Return**|
|:-|:-|
|Invested only during a market crash|391.9%|
|Invested when markets were lowest every year|371.2%|
|Invested every month an equal amount|312.9%|
|Invested at a random date every year|303.2%|
|Invested when markets were highest every year|263.1%|

The analysis did throw up some interesting results. There’s a lot to unpack here and let’s break it down by each segment.

The most important insight is that **it’s virtually impossible to lose money over the long term in the market \[3\]**. Even if you were the unluckiest person and invested exactly at the very top each year, you will still end up having a 263% return on your invested amount.

At the opposite end of the spectrum, if you were somehow the luckiest person and invested only at the lowest point every year, you would have made a cool 100% more than someone who invested only at the top. Given both the hypothetical scenarios are extreme cases, let’s consider some more realistic scenarios.      

If you did not care about timing the market and invested a fixed amount each month/year, you would still make a shade over 300% on your investments.

Out of all the above scenarios, you would have made the most amount of money (a whopping 391% return) if you invested only during major crashes. In this type of investing, you would not invest in the stock market and keeps accumulating your cash position waiting for a crash.

While this seems like a good idea, in theory, it’s extremely difficult to execute properly in real life. The main limitations to investing during a crash strategy are

a. The current returns are calculated by investing at the very bottom of the crashes. It’s very difficult to identify the bottom of the crash while a crash is happening. You can end up investing midway through the crash and given that you are investing a significant chunk of capital you saved up, it can end up wiping out your portfolio.

b. [Identifying a crash itself is very hard](https://am.jpmorgan.com/us/en/asset-management/adv/insights/market-insights/market-updates/on-the-minds-of-investors/is-a-market-correction-coming/)

As we can see from the above chart, the years that we consider were great for the market in hindsight still had significant drops within the same year. So even when the market is down 10%, it becomes extremely difficult to know whether it’s going into a deeper crash or whether it’s going to bounce back up.

**Conclusion**

While the analysis did prove that waiting for the crash is theoretically the best strategy returns-wise, practically it’s very difficult to execute it.

For e.g., even if you predicted the 2020 Coronavirus crash correctly, where would be your entry point? The market was down 15% by Mar 6th, another 10% by Mar 13th, and then another 10% by March 20th for a total of 35%. If you did not get in at the absolute bottom, you would have lost a considerable sum of your investment without actually getting any benefits from the previous run-up.   

It is extremely enticing to be the guy who called the crash correctly and even if you are right, only getting in at the absolute bottom would only give you the best returns. Adding to this, in the last 20 years, 70% of the best days in the market happened within 14 days of the worst ones \[4\]. If you miss just any of those days waiting for an entry point, your returns would be substantially lower than someone who just stayed invested.

If you think you are in the select few who have the skills to identify a crash and the temperament to see the crash through to invest at the very bottom, you will make an absolute killing in the market! For the rest of us, continuous investment regardless of the market trends seems to be the better choice.

China’s antitrust regulator is set to formally block Tencent Holdings’ plan to merge the country’s top two video game-streaming sites, Huya (HUYA) and Douyu (DOYU), three people familiar with the matter told Reuters.

Tencent has failed to come up with sufficient remedies to meet the State Administration for Market Regulation’s (SAMR) requirements on giving up exclusive rights, said two of the people.

The internet giant recently withdrew the merger application for antitrust review and refiled it after SAMR told the company it could not complete the review of the merger within 180 days since its first filing, one of them and a separate person said.

The people declined to be named as the information is private.

Tencent – China’s number one video game and social media company – Huya, Douyu and the SAMR did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment.

Separately, Tencent’s plan to take private search engine Sogou will be approved this month by SAMR, one of the people said. Reuters reported in April the regulator was ready to clear the plan.

Tencent first announced plans to merge Huya and Douyu last year in a tie-up designed to streamline its stakes in the firms, which were estimated by data firm MobTech to have an 80 per cent slice of a market worth more than US$3 billion and growing fast.

Huya and Douyu are ranked number one and number two, respectively, as China’s most popular video game-streaming sites, where users flock to watch esports tournaments and follow professional gamers.

Tencent is Huya’s biggest shareholder with 36.9 per cent and also owns over a third of Douyu, with both firms listed in the United States, and worth a combined US$6 billion in market value.

Reuters reported in March, citing people with knowledge of the matter, that Tencent was having to offer concessions in a plan to merge Huya and DouYu to resolve antitrust concerns.",China’s antitrust watchdog to block Tencent’s merger of Huya and Douyu,1625577285

stocks,"Good morning everyone! I hope you had a nice 4th of July, and enjoyed the long weekend.

*This list is geared towards day trading. With the momentum watchlist especially, I am typically in and out very quickly, only occasionally longer than a couple minutes, usually faster scalps.* Always have a plan when you enter a trade (for profit taking and for taking a loss), and use proper risk management for your account.

**Main Watchlist:**

Gapping UP:

* AXP: Looking to open at new ATH. I'll be watching for a further breakout, particularly if it can hold up over 171.50. If it shows weakness, I'll be watching for an ORB setup to the downside.
* IR: Seems to be holding up over relevant SMA's. I'll be watching for more upwards movement if it can hold up over the 49 level. 
* SHEN: Saw a big day on Friday, I'll be watching for further momentum today. 
* MRIN: Up on momentum from the past few days of trading, will be worth keeping an eye on. 
* NEGG: I'll be watching for further momentum. Like MRIN, it could get over-extended, so just be cautious. 

Gapping DOWN:

* DIDI: Recent IPO hit by Chinese tech crackdown. Could provide shorting opportunities, particularly if it can't get back above 13.50.
* BABA: Gapping down below relevant SMA's. Possible support levels at 214 and 210. 
* XPEV: Looking to open right at the SMA(20). Could provide shorting opportunities below 41.85. 
* BIDU: Gapping down below relevant SMA's at the moment. 190 could serve as a support level, could see more downwards movement if it breaks down below that level. 
* CRSP: I'll be watching price action around the 145 level. If it holds up, there could be opportunities to go long. 
* PDD: Possible support at around 115, could see more downwards movement if it breaks down. Could provide opportunities to go long if it holds up. 

**Market Outlook:**

Stocks are looking at a somewhat mixed open after we saw a strong week in the market last week. China is cracking down on some of its tech companies, and we are seeing a reaction from the market. Things aren't looking great for DIDI, but I'll be following stocks like BABA, BIDU, NIO, etc. to see how the market reacts today. SPY is trading a bit under 434, and could be due for a pullback. DIA is trading just under 348, and I'm still bullish as long as it hold up over the key level of 345. Tech stocks continue recent strength, with QQQ set to make a new ATH once again. Gold, silver, and crude oil are all green this morning. EV stocks are mixed this morning, with Chinese EV's showing weakness at the moment. Meme stocks are showing some strength this morning and will be worth following, with AMC leading the way at the moment.

Remember to use proper risk management, by making sure you size appropriately for your account and have a plan for every trade you enter (both for taking profits and cutting losses). Happy trading everyone :)","Morning Update for Tuesday, 07/06/21",1625576519

In case you don’t know what Virgin Galactic is I’ll provide a brief overview about their company:

-Virgin Galactic is a British-American spaceflight company that operates in the United States. It was founded by Richard Branson and his Virgin Group retains a 24% stake. It is developing commercial spacecraft and aims to provide suborbital spaceflights to space tourists.

Great! Now let’s talk about what they are expected to achieve in the future and their upcoming catalysts.

•First and foremost, THIS SUNDAY they’ll send the Billionaire and founder Sir Richard Branson to space! This means he will be the first billionaire to go to space while competing with Blue Origin (Jeff Bezos company- Former Amazon CEO). After this flight they will be ready to start commercialisation and start making revenue in early 2022. (On the earnings call they predict an estimated 400 flights per year in future years with major celebrities on board i.e Justin Bieber, Brad Pitt, Angelina Jolie, etc.)

•In addition, after the test flight Richard Branson is expected to make “an exciting announcement” [source (1:20)](https://twitter.com/virgingalactic/status/1410727434530422784?s=20) 

•The third catalyst is Jeff Bezos Blue Origin flight that will take place the 20th of July. This company is a competitor for Virgin Galactic and just like $SPCE they will start commercialisation after their flight. This is relevant catalysts due their auction showed us the high demand for the space tourism sector. The bid for one ticket topped a whooping $28 Million!

•Let’s not forget that in late 2020 Virgin Galactic signed an agreement with Rolls Royce to design super sonic jets. These jets are supposed to take you from New York to London in just 2 hours. Will there be an announcement about this later in the future? [source](https://www.virgingalactic.com/articles/virgin-galactic-unveils-mach-3-aircraft-design-for-high-speed-travel-and-signs-memorandum-of-understanding-with-rolls-royce/)

•Virgin Galactic is supposed to expand their fleet ([VS3 Imagine](https://www.virgingalactic.com/articles/virgin-galactic-unveils-vss-imagine-the-first-spaceship-iii-in-its-growing-fleet/) and expand operations into the UK in Cornwall Airport. Boris Johnson- UK prime minister recently authorised this airport for space related launches. [source](https://www.cornwalllive.com/news/cornwall-news/how-spaceport-cornwall-help-create-5547712)

•Lastly, there will be another flight later this year which will take the Italian Air Force to space for research. [source](https://www.virgingalactic.com/articles/virgin-galactic-and-italian-air-force-announce-world-first-government-contract-for-human-tended-research-flight/)

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

Would it be smarter to sell the stock before I get to a million dollars in annual income if the 40% capitol gains tax is increased? Would I make more money on 985k in annual income if I sold than if I got to lets say 1.2 million in profit from the investment + income and got put in the 40% capitol gains bracket under Bidens plan.

stocks,"## Origin Materials

Origin Materials is a new ticker that recently completed its merger.  They have developed technology out of UC Davis which creates plastics out of scraps of organic material: wood pulp, rice hulls, sugar cane stalks, etc.  This process ends up capturing the carbon that would reenter the atmosphere when the scrap material decays into plastics making it an incredibly effective way to capture carbon.  [Deloitte did some independent analysis and showed it captures **300%** of the carbon used in the manufacturing process](https://mcusercontent.com/3a3602da39d977d961969416f/files/da051d96-6c8e-4492-b78e-d8774523cb4c/Deloitte_Origin_Materials_LCA_of_Coproducts.pdf) making it one of the first carbon **negative** production processes!

Not only that, but since they are using scrap material the production costs are not tied to inflation or any other material such as oil.  In fact, they estimate producing these bioplastics at a cost which will be competitive with current oil based plastics  - and that doesn’t even include any carbon credit incentives!  Currently there is a supply of something like 900x what the company forecasts needing when at full capacity, so this will continue to be a cost effective approach that **isn’t tied to a volatile commodity like oil, corn, or canola oil**. 

Positive EBITDA is still out at 2025, but from there things will scale *fast*.  Origin is currently building the Origin 1 plant due EOY 2022 which will be their testbed plant that is focused on refining and optimizing their full scale production for both current and future materials.  From there, EOY 2024 will mark the completion of their Origin 2 plant which will be a full production scale facility and also create a positive EBITDA.  From there, they plan for 5 more plants estimating a $2.3bln EBITDA by 2030!  This company has the potential to absolutely boom!

[Check out more information in their investor presentation](https://www.originmaterials.com/assets/uploads/Origin-Materials_Analyst-Day-Presentation_04.2021.pdf) - but based on their estimated revenue and growth, I put the stock *today* at a value of $22 lowball and $35 highball based on a DCF model (lowball 20% discount rate, highball 15% discount rate).  The lowball is also the analyst estimate - which is quite a premium to the $10 NAV where it is now.  Even if I estimate the Origin 2 plant is delayed by a full year, the current discounted value is $18 - and on top of that adding in a 33% risk discount it’s still worth $12, almost 50% above current value.

##Leadership

These folks know their chemistry.  Lots of names out of UC Davis where this tech was developed, so this isn’t just some pipe dream MBA bullshit.  They also have lots of leadership out of the chemicals production space from the likes of Dow Chemicals.  So that’s great on that level, but how do we know they will actually be able to execute?

Their board.  Chaired by Karen Richardson who is also a board member of BP.  They have Boon Sim who was part of the acquisition team and was a leader for both Credit Suisse and Temasek Holdings - aka the sovereign wealth fund of Singapore which is known for being one of the most sophisticated funds in the world.  Along with that, execs from Clorox, Dupont, and P&amp;G.  So tons of experience and connections with huge players.  I was on the fence until I saw who was on the board - now I’m stoked.  

## Insider Buying and Investment

Just before merger, [Charles Drucker bought an *additional* 650k shares](https://fintel.io/n/us/orgn) bringing his total ownership to 18.862,500 shares.  How often do you see the acquisition company CEO buying **more** shares of a stock they bring to market?  On top of that, [Apollo Funds invested $30m in Origin](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210615005650/en/Apollo-Funds-to-Invest-in-Artius-Acquisition-to-Support-Origin-Materials%E2%80%99-Mission-to-Accelerate-the-World%E2%80%99s-Transition-to-Net-Zero-Carbon) furthering my confidence in the company.  These things happening so close to merger is super bullish and shows continued interest in the company.  On June 25th, [Lior I. Amram and Evergreen InvestCo bought 10m shares](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1802457/000119312521207655/d72044dsc13g.htm) furthering the large long term investments in the company.  

## Shareholder Redemptions

It’s not all sunshine and rainbows, so not going to try and hide negative indicators.  [Shareholders redeemed 60% of the stock, or 43m shares](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1802457/000119312521206309/d152805d8k.htm).  This is a bit of a blow to their financing plan as they had a $246m cushion in building Origin 2.  

However, this is bad **only if the share price stays below 11.50**.  Why?  There are 35m public warrants out there currently.  Each cashless redemption of those warrants (public warrants typically don’t have a cash redemption) will net the company 15% more than the shares which were redeemed pre-merger.  So overall they are missing out on $430m, but will get $402m from the warrants and with the additional $30m from Apollo it brings them back up to $432m!  On top of that, the float size **is so much smaller now**.  And as MP materials did in May, they can force the redemption of these warrants to close the funding gap if they are at a higher price.

Overall, they lost out on money but also have lower total shares so the value of the stock remains approximately the same.  Now it’s just a matter of recapturing the potential capital for future funding - hopefully through warrant redemption.

## Ridiculously Tiny Float

So due to the above, the current available float is sitting at 29m - but wait, there’s…. Less?  With the buying mentioned above, this is reduced to only 18.23m shares.  That is tiny!  We are only starting to get a sense for institutional ownership.  There just aren’t that many shares available right now so that means the price will be heavily affected by even a small increase in demand.  More volatile?  Yes, but also will make a runup in price all the more likely.  That runup will enable the redemption of those warrants which puts ORGN back into a very comfortable spot.  Since that isn’t likely to happen in 1-2 years, l’m looking for a significant upside reward to the risk of the stock.  

## Market

The market is currently pegged at $1tln of potential, so there is tons of room for expansion.  But let’s take a look at [Danimer Scientific](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/DNMR?p=DNMR) who was another company which merged last year and also looks to produce bioplastics.  If you look at their [investor presentation](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_5a9a2e12de478719519bf23247d0e8d2/danimerscientific/db/1089/9658/pdf/Project+Green+PIPE+Presentation__Final.pdf) you can see they are further along, but their **maximum** production after all their facilities are built is just a little above what **one** of the 6 production plants of Origin.  And on top of that they have to use vegetable oils, so are prone to crop inflation.  Right now they are valued at $25 which according to their data puts them at a 14x multiple of their future EBITDA and a 15% discount rate.  The same comparison would put Origin up over $40 a share today.

Origin is primed to cash in on the current boom in ESG focus.  Their current projects look to **double** in EBITDA when forecasting for the potential of carbon capture premiums and other environmental opportunities.  They can also license their technology to other companies since there is a huge market which one company can never fill.  When looking at the demand, they have already gotten $1bln in offtake commitments - and while they could have more - they have chosen to reserve capacity for higher margin items. 

On top of all that, Origin now has partnerships with Nestle, Danone, and Pepsico who are some of the largest plastic users in the world.  Match that with their connections from their board, they have the chops to make this work and scale.  And to go along with that, the merger (with warrants) will provide them with enough funding to get to their EBITDA positive timeframe with another $250mln in buffer.  So there is very little risk of dilution via share issuance.

Beyond their factories, they are also looking at licensing hte technology for another revenue stream to further accelerate growth (none of my calculations take this into account).  The potential for additional revenue is just absolutely massive since there is a $1 ***TRILLION*** addressable market opportunity.  Once in a lifetime opportunity.

## Competitors

Origin doesn’t have any direct competitors, but it does have some analogs.  PureCycle is one, but their focus is on biodegradable plastics.  They use canola oil as their feedstock so their price is tied to the price of the commodity - and even at relatively low costs today they still cost $1/lb vs $0.29/lb for Origin.  Also, there are a ton of products that **shouldn’t be biodegradable** - car parts for example shouldn’t be degrading!  Danimer Scientific is another analogue, but has the same issues as Purecycle.  

In the end, there is **no other company that is looking to make carbon negative plastics**.  

## Elephant in the Room

Plastics are an environmental problem.  There are microplastics that are increasing in concentration in the ocean and in ocean life specifically and they have become a disease on the planet.  Why am I okay with this personally for Origin?  Well simply, it is a step in the right direction.  There are a large number of applications which require non-biodegradability but ultimately this begins to get market penetration with **zero modification** for carbon reduction.  It’s a trade off for sure, but it’s only the start.

Things start to look much better with [net zero fuel pellets](https://investors.originmaterials.com/static-files/5ca7896d-4270-43df-bac4-7c20a353443e)  and water filters, carbon black, and agricultural applications which (aside from the fuel) are all carbon negative.  In the end, this is an insanely huge step towards reducing our carbon footprint and right now that takes priority for me



## Risks

They currently have no revenue and are building their first plant, Origin 1.  This plant is still just a testing plant and they are quite far away from revenue positive.  The plant was also delayed a year, likely due to COVID, but they now have the equipment on site.  Right now the price is trading between $8-9, and has a ways to go before it hits $11.50 and beyond - and it absolutely needs to hit that in order to remain financially healthy through the finished construction of Origin 2.  Additionally, Origin 2 could have delays and complications with its site choice along with the possibility of cost overruns due to inflation, etc.  

## Overall

There is a huge push for countries and companies to reduce their carbon footprint, and this company is set to not only make a very profitable and sustainable product - but to also capture a shitton of carbon doing it.  In the long run this company is likely going to explode in value as they have the talent, experience, and in demand product.  

There are real risks here, but the upside is **enormous** as this is a true potential unicorn.  I’m looking at a potential return of 10-30x over the next 10 years with a short term (next 2 years) return of 5-6x.  If Origin 1 gets online at the end of next year as planned, look for this stock to really take off!

stocks,"The dispute between UAE and the rest of OPEC has come to a halt with both sides failing to meet an agreement. I think this is a great short term catalyst to the oil trade. The futures for Brent and WTI are near their yearly highs and I see this sticking for the near term. 

Tuesday we may see a rally in oil companies and stocks as the price of oil doesn't seem to have much reason to come down, other than the unlikely scenario of a price war between the countries in OPEC. I do not feel like this will happen. 

Before the long weekend I sold my July 16 Exxon calls. Probably shouldn't have, but I took my profits and put them into January Halliburton and SLB calls. Hopefully I didn't bite myself in the ass, given the news, I bet my itm Exxon calls would've done well tomorrow, although they were 10 dte. I erred on the side of caution with that call, fearing theta would take majority of my gains. 

I doubt we will see energy dip tomorrow and I expect american companies to see modest gains actually, since OPEC doesn't seem to be raising supply at this surge in demand. If energy does decide to dip into tomorrow, I will be a buyer. 

The OIH should see good gains in this news, as well as the XLE. The companies I am choosing to play this with are Exxon, Devon, Suncor, Halliburton, and Schlumberger. I have shares of Exxon, and 6 month calls on everything else. I am very overweight this trade. 

I still believe there will be room to run on this trade and I think we may see peak prices in December, when many are going to travel for the winter. The other catalyst being Europe's reopening, which is still relatively early, catching steam and putting the oil market on fire. 

I wasn't a big believer in $100 a barrel, and I plan to exit my side of the trade before the price gets there, but I see it as more of an upside risk now due to the latest OPEC news.

I know the company right now isn't in the best of shape, having squandered its position atop the semiconductor totem pole, and while it's easy to kick it when it's down, is there anyone who truly believes that it can turn around and gain back what it's lost? Sure, it may take a year or more (barring a miracle), but we've seen AMD give Intel a run for its money before (though never to *this* degree), and Intel managed to recover. Plus, the current CEO looks like a huge upgrade over the last guy; not only is he an engineer, but he'd been with the company decades ago when it was just starting to become the behemoth it would eventually be.

I barely manage to spread out my 401K and other retirement in different areas, I fully recognize that I should have just sold off the shares and be done.

Now let’s look a Q1 2021 which was reported on June 29th. Revenue of $33 million (which beat the entire year of 2020) and eps of $0.19! The reason for the huge earnings growth of 567% yoy is that Q1 we had income included from the many recent acquisitions ( 3weeks worth).
Looking forward to Q2, this explosive growth is going to get better, and I mean much better. Guidance from management is revenue of $147.6 million and gross profit of $26.7, Adjusted EBITDA of $10.3 million or $1.03eps. FOR 1 QUARTER! 
The Market Cap for this company is Stupid! $147.78 million as of Friday. 
This cannot last at this low valuation, our revenue for 1 Quarter will come in equal to our entire MC. 
Short sellers have owned this stock due to the share structure! The public float is roughly 6million and 40% of float is owned by insiders. Total float around 10 million.
I am writing this up for two reasons.
1. To bring some awareness to this small company.
2. To see if someone has a bear case against them.

stocks,"So, just a bit of context, I've been doing research on how to invest in the stock market for the past six years. I've learned a great deal during my journey, which started on this very forum. To parse the incredible amount of data that's available, I've had to learn programing and (re-learn) data science. 

The end result of my efforts (so far) is a fully modular stock screener. It's able to pick and choose numbers from financial reports (balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow) and not only generate ratios, but as well as trends across time, and compare these companies to their peers. 

There are three limitations to this screener: the first is that the company must have four years of financial information available, so for example, the fan-favorite PLTR is not available. This is kind of by design, because established companies generally safer. The second limitation is that only fundamentals data is included, and price data + options data isn't. That will be addressed in the second part of my project, which deals mainly with risk management (ie: position sizing and diversification). The third limitation is that it's only limited to companies listed on the NASDAQ.

Here's an example output below: 

https://imgur.com/a/vu5GQ2N

The first column is the slope of the trend in revenue (flat) over four years (in thousand/day), and the second column is the slope of the trend in net income (flat) over four years (in thousand/day), sorted by the first column. The stocks included in this search are the top 100 technological service companies by market cap. 

Why am I showing off? Well, the first part is a little affirmation for my work. The second part is beta testing. If there are any industry leaders you'd like for me to look and compare fundamentals for, just provide the company and fundamentals and I'll see what I can do. 

I hope this post doesn't count as self promotion, as I'm not looking to monetize this in any way shape or form, now and in the future. It's mostly for myself so that I can reduce the amount of research done, and as a programming exercise.

stocks,"the premise is finding companies that are undervalued/discounted.  A lot of times companies that are maybe in danger of bankruptcy or trending out of style, while obviously the most risky, have the most potential to turn around and pick back up.  Its that company that looks like things aren't working out on the surface, but you do some research, really dig deep through all the numbers and determine that you know what, I think this company can make it another 5 years. Everything seems stable, and the stock market is overreacting a bit.

So thats the premise of value investing. Find the discounted stocks. My question is how does one even go about looking for them? Is there an easy way to find a list of companies that have low share price or market cap? Like how can I be efficient at finding companies to analyze that are worth the time? One idea I had was to look at some small cap &amp; Micro cap ETFs and value/growth ETFs. Then you could kind of look through what holdings they have, look at some of the companies in closer detail and maybe use that as a way to find these companies. I'm not talking about investing in ETF but using them as a list of their holdings to find stocks to analyze.  
I think doing a valuation on a company is one thing, but you also have to find the companies worth evaluated and do so efficiently. So far this is the best idea I've been able to come up with for how to find value stocks to analyze.

stocks,"Hi guys,

Recently I've been bullish on Rite Aid - perhaps foolishly so. I've spent sometime putting this thesis together so I want you to poke as many holes as you possibly can in it. I'm not looking for confirmation bias, I'm looking for someone to challenge me to help me catch my blindspots. 

&amp;#x200B;

* Rite Aid generates more annual revenues than all of McDonald's! (This trivia alone could probably win you some bar bets!).
* Rite Aid's Market Cap is $878 MILLION compared to McDonald's $173 BILLION. 
* Rite Aid is the 3rd largest pharmacy chain in the US and currently has +2500 stores. 
   * How much those +2500 stores are worth? we don't know, but Walgreens bought 1900 stores from Rite Aid for $4.4B in 2019. (Rite Aid used to have +4000 stores then)
* Rite Aid's Market cap is ($878M) compared with CVS ($108B) &amp; Walgreens ($41B)
* Rite Aid owns Thrifty Ice cream brand, and they paid $2B to acquire Elixir (pharmacy benefit management). The PBM market is +400B market and growing.
* Rite Aid is undergoing a transformation as we speak, they launched a new strategy a year ago which is focusing on (Becoming the dominant midmarket PBM, Revitalizing the retail and digital experience, and unlocking the value of the pharmacists)
* When Amazon hinted that they want to enter the brick &amp; mortar pharmacy business, Motley Fool did a piece a month ago where expected Rite Aid to be bought by Amazon (Don't forget Rite Aid is the #1 pharmacy in Seattle, and Amazon's HQ is there)
* I'm personally not a 'short squeeze guy', I think it is a rare occurrence, but for the record Rite Aid has 54M outstanding shares, around 61% of those are owned by institutions, 2% by insiders, the rest (20M shares) by retail. 9M shares are shorted. So basically about 45% of retail shares are shorted. Rite Aid has that 'nostalgia' and 'retail' feel that GME has.
* Remember that Rite Aid trades in a very basic and essential commodity (Food &amp; Drugs)

&amp;#x200B;

Now that you've reached to this line, you may ask yourself, where is the but? Why Rite Aid is trading so cheaply.Well, don't worry, I got you!Rite Aid's debt is considered very high

* Rite Aid is having a difficult time turning in profit (-$13M last quarter) (Although I may say, the adjusted EPS was positive)
* Rite Aid's Opex &amp; SGA has been increasing
* All of the factors above is affecting the cashflow
* The CEO seems to be an idiot, she keeps providing negative FY outlooks which is affecting the SP even lower. This happened in the last 2 quarters (June &amp; March). Somehow I think she's sandbagging.
* With all that being said, there are key metrics that are improving, the EPS has improved the last 2 quarters (hopefully next quarter they turn in profit)
* Rite Aid has been restructuring their debt and there is not a single LT debt that is due until 2023! 
* the revenues has been growing in the last 4 years (last quarter they reported 2.2% YoY growth).

Now ask yourself, is $RAD worth the risk? It is up to you. I personally think it is just a matter of time before someone competent can figure out how to turn in major profit out of $24+ Billions in revenues. and I'm having a hard time believing that a company that has +2500 pharmacy and a PBM system along with an ice cream brand is valued at $890M only.

* The original comment and the first and second reply follow the exact same script
* The third reply is saying to get professional advice from a financial advisor and they end telling how successful they've been
* Fourth reply asking for the third commenters financial advisor
* The fifth reply is ""third reply guy"" telling them the name of the advisor and to go to their website

**I google the name of the financial advisor:**

* First link is brokercheck.finra (a place to find if a person is a registered to sell securities). Everything seems to be in order at least to my untrained eye.

* I can't find any other source that this person exists. No social media or anything else that would prove her existence.
* On her website and brokercheck.finra it says she has worked for Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith Incorporated since 1998, but on Merill Lynch's site ([www.ml.com](https://www.ml.com/)) you can't find her in their ""Find an advisor"" search.
* The comments promoting her, all the commenters are quite new accounts and have been made the same day or the day before each other. (They look like bought/bot accounts to me)

stocks,"Hey guys - been doing a lot of reading recently and figured I should share some of the cooler stuff with the community. I whipped this up quickly but can do a more in-depth dive for this and other papers if there turns out to be interest. The paper is called [A Half Century of Macro Momentum](https://www.aqr.com/-/media/AQR/Documents/Insights/White-Papers/A-Half-Century-of-Macro-Momentum.pdf) by Jordan Brooks of AQR Capital. They’re a quant fund that runs a number of successful strategies. Nothing I say here is investment advice by the way, and I do recommend checking out the paper if interested.

**- - - Executive Summary (given in paper)**

*I outline a systematic and diversified approach to global macro investing grounded in economic theory, and detail its performance over the last half century. The analysis shows that the strategy has the potential to deliver strong positive returns, low correlation to traditional asset classes across various macroeconomic environments, and to provide diversification in bear equity markets and rising real yield environments. This systematic global macro strategy appears to be a complement to other alternative risk premia — such as trend-following and long-short value, momentum, and carry strategies — and does not appear to be fully exploited by existing global macro managers.*

**- - - My Summary (in layman’s terms)**

Global macro is a type of investing that involves looking at macroeconomic factors, well, globally. These factors include stuff like unemployment, business cycles, interest rates, international trade, and monetary policy (actions of the Fed and central banks around the world). Global macro investors make predictions based on studying these factors to figure out their outlook for the economy, and invest accordingly. This means their investment universe is much larger than just stocks. They look at long-term government bonds, currencies, and interest rate-affected assets (like short term bonds).

Momentum trading is a strategy that typically involves looking at trends in stock prices and assuming that those trends will keep on going for a short period. For example, if there is upward momentum on a stock, momentum traders want to get in now while it’s still going up. Clearly, this is usually a short-term trading strategy.

In a nutshell, macro momentum is a macro investing strategy that pulls from momentum strategies. Instead of looking at price trends, it looks at macroeconomic trends. It goes long (buys) assets that have positive macroeconomic indicators (explained below) and short (sells) if vice versa. The four asset types this strategy looks at are stocks, currencies, long-term government bonds, and short-term bonds (the paper calls this “global interest rates”). The four macroeconomic indicators this strategy looks at are business cycles (generally, how is the economy doing), monetary policy (what is the Fed doing, is it conservative or aggressive), international trade, and risk sentiment (are stocks going up or down).

[Exhibit 1: Summary of Macro Momentum Indicators](https://i.imgur.com/x1nJJcF.png)

Let’s talk through how I think about this, starting with the column “Increasing Growth.” If the economy is doing well, people have money, so they invest their money into stocks, making the outlook good for stocks. Stocks usually give more of a return than bonds, so their demand goes down, as does their price, making the outlook worse for longer term and shorter term bonds — I’m aware this isn’t the full picture but it’s how I think about it, bond folks please chip in if you’d like to add anything here. Growth is good for currencies as it is accompanied by more business and foreign investment, meaning more demand for the currency - the paper talks about the Balassa-Samuelson hypothesis here, which pretty much says countries with high productivity and therefore prices for tradable goods have higher prices for services too (developed countries vs. developing countries).

Moving to int’l trade, this is captured by looking at whether the currency is depreciating (getting weaker, purchasing power decreasing) on a 1-year basis. Depreciating currency is good for stocks (because our currency is weaker compared to int’l currencies, our goods are relatively cheaper and there’s more demand for them and the companies that sell them), bad for currencies (similar idea to momentum, if currencies have been depreciating, we expect them to continue), and bad for bonds and interest rates. For this last bit, here’s how I think about it — if my currency is depreciating and getting weaker than other currencies, global investors don’t want to be holding it (effectively, its “price” is decreasing). Something that makes a currency attractive is a high interest rate, so parking your money in that currency earns you interest, so a weakening currency’s central bank has less incentive to decrease rates. The price of bonds and other interest rate products increases as rates decrease, meaning this environment/scenario is overall negative for bonds.

Monetary policy, captured by looking at 1-year changes in the yield curve - this is where the x axis is the term of the bond and the y axis is the interest rate paid, it’s usually upward sloping in a good economy and downward in a bad one. If the Fed gets tighter (money printer out of ink), this is bad for stocks and bonds because there’s not as much money to go into these; and it’s good for currencies because it decreases the money supply and increases interest rates (more int’l investment into our currency).

Finally, the risk sentiment is captured by looking at 1-year stock market returns. Increasing risk sentiment is when the stock market has strong returns. This is good for stocks (momentum) and currencies (int’l investment into our stocks), and bad for bonds (who wants to invest in bonds when stocks are doing so well).

**- - - Creating a Macro Momentum Portfolio**

With this in mind, we now want to create our macro momentum portfolio. This will consist of a long-short portfolio (LS) and a directional portfolio (D) for each combo of indicators and assets. So there’s four indicators times four asset types times two types of portfolios meaning we’ll have 32 “sub” portfolios total that we’ll then combine into the final macro momentum portfolio.

LS — these are market neutral. This portfolio takes a long position in assets with favorable trends (above the average) and short for the assets with unfavorable trends (below the average). Because we’re doing all this with the average in mind, there’s a theoretical neutral exposure to the market, meaning this should perform despite market movements.

D — these take long positions in assets with favorable trends and shorts in assets with unfavorable trends, meaning there’s no computation of an average, and the portfolio can be long or short-exposed.

So we have a LS portfolio for stocks using the economic growth (business cycle) indicator, a D portfolio for the same, an LS for stocks using int’l trade as an indicator, a D portfolio for the same, etc. Once we have the 32 total, he aggregate macro momentum portfolio is created by taking an equal weight across all 32 asset-indicator portfolios.

It’s easy to get lost in the specifics here, so I’ll repeat what we’re doing from a bird’s eye view again. We’re looking at 4 macroeconomic indicators from generally the past year, applying those indicators to 4 asset classes to make a table like the above, and then pretty much using those indicators to predict how the asset classes will perform over the next year. Rebalanced annually.

**- - - Performance**

This portfolio was tested from Jan 1970 to Dec 2016. That means it’s seen the bear markets of 1987, 2000, and 2008, but not 2020. It’s also seen recessions, wars, stagflation, and disinflation. Here are the results in a table:

[Exhibit 3: Macro Momentum Strategy Performance since 1970](https://i.imgur.com/bbeBBzU.png)

Let’s unpack this. Looks like a consistently market-beating strategy that is un-correlated with the stock and bond markets. One question you might have is, “if this is so good, why doesn’t AQR just invest fully in it?“ The best answer here is probably liquidity — as a fund with \~$150B in assets, it’s impossible to employ your capital all in one strategy without affecting prices enough that you’d no longer be beating markets. Also, AQR’s only been around since 1998, and although I’m sure they had this research in some way or another before the paper was published, it did just come out in 2017.

The table shows a CAGR for the strat (without accounting for inflation) of 13%, compared to [8.41% for the S&amp;P](http://www.moneychimp.com/features/market_cagr.htm). It beats its composite assets' returns in rising yield and falling yield markets, in bull runs and bear markets (on average), and has a higher Sharpe Ratio than the S&amp;P for the period (1.2 vs. around 1.0). It’s non-correlated with bonds and has something of a negative correlation with stocks. Does the latter number mean it goes down when stocks go up, meaning it’s gone down for the majority of the period. No. The paper calls the returns of the strategy a “smile” compared to stock returns. Here’s a graph.

[Exhibit 2: Quarterly Returns, 1970-2016](https://i.imgur.com/ZQO1o8p.png)

When stocks are up, this portfolio is up a bit too (that's called a slightly positive beta). When stocks are down, this portfolio is up a whole lot (a very negative beta). On average, the portfolio has a slightly negative beta compared to stocks, as mentioned earlier.

Decided to sell cash secured puts on NIO stock just before the February crash,  I’m just good like that. At a 50$ strike of course I got assigned which isn’t a big deal in and of itself but shares fell to 31 a share and I couldn’t buy any because I was severely underwater on my new acquisition.  Wanted to sell CC but CC at 50$ strike were basically not worth it because the stock could breakout at any time.  If I had just kept cash on hand and bought the dip I’d be up 60% percent already vs just broke even.  

Bought calls on Palantir during the same crash figuring it was probably a sure thing well 350 options were worth 50$ when I sold them close to expiry.

The Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) said on its social media feed that it had ordered Didi to make changes to comply with Chinese data protection rules. It did not specify the nature of Didi's violation.

Didi responded by saying it had stopped registering new users and would remove its app from app stores. It said it would make changes to comply with rules and protect users' rights.

Businesses around the world rushed Saturday to contain a ransomware attack that has paralyzed their computer networks, a situation complicated in the U.S. by offices lightly staffed at the start of the Fourth of July holiday weekend. It’s not yet known how many organizations have been hit by demands that they pay a ransom in order to get their systems working again. But some cybersecurity researchers predict the attack targeting customers of software supplier Kaseya could be one of the broadest ransomware attacks on record. It follows a scourge of headline-grabbing attacks over recent months that have been a source of diplomatic tension between U.S. President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin over whether Russia has become a safe haven for cybercriminal gangs.

Biden said Saturday he didn’t yet know for certain who was responsible but suggested that the U.S. would respond if Russia was found to have anything to do with it. “If it is either with the knowledge of and or a consequence of Russia then I told Putin we will respond,” Biden said. “We’re not certain. The initial thinking was it was not the Russian government.” Cybersecurity experts say the REvil gang, a major Russian-speaking ransomware syndicate, appears to be behind the attack that targeted the software company Kaseya, using its network-management package as a conduit to spread the ransomware through cloud-service providers. “The number of victims here is already over a thousand and will likely reach into the tens of thousands,” said cybersecurity expert Dmitri Alperovitch of the Silverado Policy Accelerator think tank. “No other ransomware campaign comes even close in terms of impact.”

The cybersecurity firm ESET says there are victims in least 17 countries, including the United Kingdom, South Africa, Canada, Argentina, Mexico, Kenya and Germany. In Sweden, most of the grocery chain Coop’s 800 stores were unable to open because their cash registers weren’t working, according to SVT, the country’s public broadcaster. The Swedish State Railways and a major local pharmacy chain were also affected. Kaseya CEO Fred Voccola said in a statement that the company believes it has identified the source of the vulnerability and will “release that patch as quickly as possible to get our customers back up and running.”

Voccola said fewer than 40 of Kaseya’s customers were known to be affected, but experts said the ransomware could still be affecting hundreds more companies that rely on Kaseya’s clients that provide broader IT services. John Hammond of the security firm Huntress Labs said he was aware of a number of managed-services providers — companies that host IT infrastructure for multiple customers — being hit by the ransomware, which encrypts networks until the victims pay off attackers. “It’s reasonable to think this could potentially be impacting thousands of small businesses,” said Hammond, basing his estimate on the service providers reaching out to his company for assistance and comments on Reddit showing how others are responding.

At least some victims appeared to be getting ransoms set at $45,000, considered a small demand but one that could quickly add up when sought from thousands of victims, said Brett Callow, a ransomware expert at the cybersecurity firm Emsisoft.

Callow said it’s not uncommon for sophisticated ransomware gangs to perform an audit after stealing a victim’s financial records to see what they can really pay, but that won’t be possible when there are so many victims to negotiate with. “They just pitched the demand amount at a level most companies will be willing to pay,” he said. Voccola said the problem is only affecting its “on-premise” customers, which means organizations running their own data centers. It’s not affecting its cloud-based services running software for customers, though Kaseya also shut down those servers as a precaution, he said. The company added in a statement Saturday that “customers who experienced ransomware and receive a communication from the attackers should not click on any links -- they may be weaponized.”

Gartner analyst Katell Thielemann said it’s clear that Kaseya quickly sprang to action, but it’s less clear whether their affected clients had the same level of preparedness. “They reacted with an abundance of caution,” she said. “But the reality of this event is it was architected for maximum impact, combining a supply chain attack with a ransomware attack.” Supply chain attacks are those that typically infiltrate widely used software and spread malware as it updates automatically. Complicating the response is that it happened at the start of a major holiday weekend in the U.S., when most corporate IT teams aren’t fully staffed. That could also leave those organizations unable to address other security vulnerabilities, such a dangerous Microsoft bug affecting software for print jobs, said James Shank, of threat intelligence firm Team Cymru.

“Customers of Kaseya are in the worst possible situation,” he said. “They’re racing against time to get the updates out on other critical bugs.” Shank said “it’s reasonable to think that the timing was planned” by hackers for the holiday. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce said it was affecting hundreds of businesses and was “another reminder that the U.S. government must take the fight to these foreign cybercriminal syndicates” by investigating, disrupting and prosecuting them.

The federal Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency said in a statement that it is closely monitoring the situation and working with the FBI to collect more information about its impact. CISA urged anyone who might be affected to “follow Kaseya’s guidance to shut down VSA servers immediately.” Kaseya runs what’s called a virtual system administrator, or VSA, that’s used to remotely manage and monitor a customer’s network. The privately held Kaseya is based in Dublin, Ireland, with a U.S. headquarters in Miami.

REvil, the group most experts have tied to the attack, was the same ransomware provider that the FBI linked to an attack on JBS SA, a major global meat processor forced to pay a $11 million ransom, amid the Memorial Day holiday weekend in May. Active since April 2019, the group provides ransomware-as-a-service, meaning it develops the network-paralyzing software and leases it to so-called affiliates who infect targets and earn the lion’s share of ransoms. U.S. officials have said the most potent ransomware gangs are based in Russia and allied states and operate with Kremlin tolerance and sometimes collude with Russian security services. Alperovitch said he believes the latest attack is financially motivated and not Kremlin-directed.",Massive Ransomware attack before holiday leaves companies across at least 17 countries scrambling,1625359556

There has been DD highlighting the bull cases for investing in $BODY, but I haven’t seen the bear cases acknowledged. There are two sides, and I think it’s important to discuss both. Here are my thoughts on the common bear arguments I’ve seen. Let me know what I’m missing. (TL/DR summary at bottom)

1. Subscriber base will decrease as people go back to gyms instead.

For the three months ended March 31, 2021 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2020 They have a [95.8% month over month digital retention.](https://investors.thebeachbodycompany.com/news/news-details/2021/Forest-Road-Acquisition-Corp.-and-The-Beachbody-Company-Announce-Combined-First-Quarter-2021-Financial-Results-for-Beachbody-and-Myx/default.aspx)

COVID forced people to exercise at home for the first time. Many had no idea how time and cost efficient this is with minimal hassle and equipment needed.  Now they know. Also, I believe the newfound freedom and flexibility of people who continue to work from home reinforces the argument for at home exercising. Can’t slip in a midday workout if your at the office. 

Some people don’t enjoy exercising at home due to space, preferred equipment, distraction, etc, or they enjoy the gym atmosphere, or a change in environment. These people will return to the gym.  Some may stream Beachbody content at the gym rather than use a personal trainer or dietician.  For only $8.25 more per month, they can access Beachbody’s excellent content AND nutrition plans. 

In addition to Beachbody merging with Myx Fitness (the at-home connected fitness bike manufacturer), they ALSO merged with Openfit, which is now available at some gyms. [LA Fitness, Esporta Fitness and City Sports Club members can add Openfit to their membership for $5/month.](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/fitness-international-to-provide-its-members-with-openfit-the-all-in-one-digital-fitness-nutrition-and-wellness-platform-301277399.html)  I would not be surprised if more gyms partner with Beachbody in the future. Again, their content is excellent. 



2. It’s an MLM business.  MLMs are evil and a scam.

Beachbody has an MLM component. The coaches. They refer to coaches as a “network of independent contractors”. In my opinion, they’re just playing with semantics by calling it that instead of an MLM. 

Here’s the scoop. [Coach info on website](https://faq.beachbody.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/4313/~/review-of-the-team-beachbody-coach-business-opportunity)
&gt; “People can sign up to be a Coach online for a one-time $39.95 sign-up fee plus a $15.95 recurring monthly fee-this covers ongoing access to their website, training, reporting, and personal development content, plus all the back-end operations of warehousing and shipping products to their customers from Beachbody.”

On the positive side, their model seems better than other MLMs (if that’s a thing). 
&gt; “Coaches earn commissions from sales of Beachbody fitness and nutrition products (like Shakeology) plus a lot of hard work, not from recruiting fees or business fees. **Coaches are never required to buy or hold inventory of product**. Coaches must sell products themselves. **They don't just make money off of the product sales of Coaches underneath them.**”

Carl’s reasoning for having coaches is to reward people who have achieved life changing results from Beachbody products and want to help others to achieve their health goals as well.  Some people have found success being a coach, others have not and are disgruntled with the company because of this. 

Do I like the MLM aspect? No.
Is it a deal breaker for me? No. Here’s why:

- **You don’t need to interact with coaches or become one to purchase Beachbody products.** The coaches are just one avenue they use to sell &amp; advertise. It is not the business as a whole.

- The coaches are classified as independent contractors, just like Uber and Lyft drivers.  However, Beachbody can function as a company without them, unlike Uber and Lyft.  And I don’t see institutional buyers running away from those companies.

- Other businesses use MLMs and are profitable and successful. Examples: 
&gt; LULU (Lululemon): 2.46B gross profit, $368/share, 49.88B market cap, 87% held by institutions
&gt; HLF (Herbalife): 4.39B gross profit, $53.17/share, 5.74B market cap, 82% held by institutions
(*numbers taken from yahoo finance on 7/2/21*)

- The MLM component is clearly profitable for them, otherwise they would have dropped it.  I want to invest in profitable businesses, especially if I like their products (which I do).


TL/DR
Bear Cases:
**Subscriber base will decrease as people go back to gyms.**
Rebuttal:
- [95.8% month over month digital retention.](https://investors.thebeachbodycompany.com/news/news-details/2021/Forest-Road-Acquisition-Corp.-and-The-Beachbody-Company-Announce-Combined-First-Quarter-2021-Financial-Results-for-Beachbody-and-Myx/default.aspx)
- Gym goers will still use streaming services.
- [LA Fitness, Esporta Fitness and City Sports Club members can add Openfit (part of $BODY) to their membership for $5/month.](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/fitness-international-to-provide-its-members-with-openfit-the-all-in-one-digital-fitness-nutrition-and-wellness-platform-301277399.html)

Rebuttal:

I’m really comfortable with my strategy of basically using the options theta wheel strategy by selling covered calls and cash secured puts on good companies. Maybe take smaller positions that are higher risk-to-reward ratio. Having more money would scale the process higher. 

Let’s say I myself had 50k and would accept family and friends to pass me a couple thousand they wouldn’t know what to do with. Let’s say 5k from a relative. 

So now I have $55k. $(5/50)K is 10%. Out of fairness since that $5k is now been absorbed into my portfolio which is 10% of the whole balance. They’d be entitled to 10% gross but there’d be taxes and fees (as a Canadian there are broker fees) and of course I’d want to take a little commission for the work. 

There’s also a little consideration that let’s say before they added to my fund, maybe I had positions already it’s not like I just started it with cash not yet invested. What if I had invested in a stock that 10x way before I accepted an outside investor, would they be entitled to 7-9% of my position? 

This isn’t only something to look under the light of stocks it’s good for me to understand how to visualize what’s mine and what’s the investors’ when I want to raise funds.

Reason I keep adding money no matter the market price is because in previous strategies I tried timing the market and ended up with more missed out profits than prevented losses, so I decided that on average, time in the market is better than timing the market.

Senior Vice President, Capital Markets and Strategy

Hi David-
 
CRAZY day today, to be sure.  The Google policy-shift noise was the source of our weakness today…and was severely misinterpreted by investors today…
 
https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22557390/google-apk-app-bundles-package-format-play-store
 
 There are scarier, more (wrongfully-)opinionated versions of the same story floating around out there today, some of which seem to wish to imply that Google is working to effectively remove all other app install sources.  This is UNTRUE – we are fully onboard with Google in this “bundle” effort that is rooted in other, more logical incentives.  Most importantly, this has ZERO impact on our business (we fully applaud the movement to app bundles and support app bundles already as part of our platform).
 
There is NO way that our stock should be down on this noise.  
 
 Total madness today.  Speculation led to outright fear.  We fully support Google’s efforts in this area…just as they fully accept &amp; support our participation in the ecosystem.  Our business is just as fully healthy as it was yesterday…and will ideally continue to be going forward.

# **Fed could be a surprise catalyst for the markets in holiday week - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/02/fed-could-be-a-surprise-catalyst-for-markets-in-holiday-week-.html)**
*****
&gt; The quiet holiday week ahead could hold some fireworks for investors if the Federal Reserve reveals its thinking on its bond buying program.
*****
&gt; The four-day trading week could see stocks drift, after hitting new highs this past week. The closely watched 10-year Treasury yield has held under 1.5%, a positive for tech which outperformed with a 3.2% gain for the week.
*****
&gt; There are very few economic reports of note, aside from ISM services data on Tuesday. But the Fed’s minutes from its last meeting will be released Wednesday afternoon, and there is potential for the market to learn more about the central bank’s behind-the-scenes discussions on winding down its quantitative easing program.
*****
&gt; “Our base case is that rates drift higher, but in order to that get that move higher you need a catalyst to get there,” said Brian Daingerfield, head of G10 FX strategy Americas at NatWest Markets. “Either the Fed has to move forward aggressively on tapering, or you have to get the data really rocking, and you don’t have either.”
*****
&gt; Friday’s report that 850,000 jobs were added in June was better than expected. However, the unemployment rate missed expectations after rising by 0.1 percentage points to 5.9%. Economists expected the rate to fall to 5.6%. The report was not seen as strong enough to encourage the Fed to step away sooner from its easy policies. It was, however, seen as a positive — yet largely incomplete — picture of the labor market.
*****
&gt; Daingerfield said there is the potential for the Fed’s June meeting minutes to surprise the market, similar to the way April minutes did.
*****
&gt; “Remember, Powell said they were not talking about talking about tapering,” he said, referring to Fed Chairman Jerome Powell’s comments right after the April meeting. “Remember, Powell was very dismissive, and then the minutes revealed a kind of drift to the committee.”
*****
&gt; The April meeting minutes did surprise investors when they noted that “a number of participants” said it would be appropriate to begin discussing tapering bond purchases at upcoming meetings if the economy continues to make rapid progress. After the June meeting, Powell revealed early stage discussions about paring back bond buying. The Fed also presented a new forecast that included two rate hikes in 2023, where there were none indicated before.
*****
&gt; The market is highly sensitive to details about the Fed’s bond purchase program since the ending to that measure would be open the door for the central bank to raise interest rates. The low-rate environment has been the kindling behind the stock market’s robust gains since the Fed went all out to help the economy get through the pandemic. Cutting back on the monthly $120 billion bond purchases would be the first rollback of those extraordinary measures.
*****
&gt; “There’s a lot we don’t know about the Fed’s thinking about tapering,” Daingerfield said. He said key information would be when it plans to start, how rapidly it will move to wind down the program and how it decides to break down its current monthly purchases of $80 billion in Treasurys and $40 billion in mortgage securities.
*****
&gt; “These details really do matter. Did they get into that conversation at all about details? The more detail they discussed, the more likely it is they are looking to move forward sooner,” Daingerfield said. Fed watchers widely expect more details about tapering the bond program around its annual symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming in late August, and then start slowing purchases later this year or early in 2022.
*****
&gt; For now, the positive tone in the bond market has helped stocks. The 10-year yield, which moves opposite price, has fallen from its high of the year of about 1.75%. At that level, technology and growth shares were under pressure.
*****
&gt; But they’ve been making a comeback as rates drift around in a range below 1.6%. The 10-year was at 1.43% Friday, and while the lower rate may help tech stocks, the yield level is a sharp contrast to an economy that was expected to grow at more than 10% in the second quarter.
*****
&gt; That pace is expected to slow, but growth for the year is expected to be robust at more than 7%.
*****
&gt; # Tech transition
&gt; Citi Private Bank chief investment strategist Steven Wieting said that, with the economy peaking, the time is right for investors to begin transitioning to tech and growth shares from the popular cyclical trade.
*****
&gt; “We’re seeing this as all a temporary period of massive distortions, and within a year from now, we’ll be on steadier water,” he said. “I think this is giving people a reason, including us, to move away from just cyclical rebound trades and into some sustainable growth opportunities.”
*****
&gt; Year to date, cyclicals have been some of the better performers. Energy shares are up 44.5% with the rebound in oil prices, and financials have bounced 25.2%. In contrast, S&amp;P 500 growth stocks are up 14.3%, lagging slightly the S&amp;P 500′s 15.5% gain. Tech stocks are up just 14.9% year-to-date.
*****
&gt; One area Wieting now likes is global health care. The S&amp;P 500 health care sector was up 12.5% for the year so far.
*****
&gt; “Health care is a mid-cycle outperformer. Health care is a part of the economy that didn’t fall as hard,” he said. “Earnings and revenues have grown moderately every year since the mid-1980s.” He said the sector has lagged the S&amp;P 500 since the end of 2019 by 10 percentage points, and has a cheap valuation. Big pharma stocks are among the best dividend payers.
*****
&gt; For the major sectors, on a 12-month basis, the cyclical sectors of industrials, materials, and energy have all risen more than 40%, and tech has had a similar 42% gain.
*****
&gt; “The growth stocks have stayed rich. The value stocks have completely caught up with growth stocks in 12-month performance, but the valuation hasn’t been beaten down in growth stocks,” he said. “Gradually we’re going to get more sustained performance out of tech after this period where it flatlined.”
*****
&gt; Wieting said one area that is particularly attractive is cybersecurity, where demand is strong as a “tech spending essential,” but the sector has gone nowhere.
*****
&gt; For instance, the iShares Cybersecurity and Tech ETF IHAK is just below its 52 week high set in January, and the Global X Cybersecurity ETF BUG is trading about a dollar below its February high.
*****
&gt; Wieting said he likes some alternative energy names and companies that are involved in digitization, including fintech.
*****
&gt; He expects the overall stock market to move higher but not at the same rapid clip.
*****
&gt; “We want to start transitioning portfolios away from just rebound plays...We’re transitioning, knowing we’ve captured significant outperformance over the past year with cyclical value. It made people comfortable investing in equities when we could show how cheap they were,” he said.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 ended the week up 1.7% at a record 4,352, while the Dow climbed 1% to 34,786. The Nasdaq was 1.9% higher, ending the week at a record 14,639.

&gt; # Typical July Seasonal Pattern: Bullish Through Mid-Month &amp; Tepid After

&gt; This July has commenced with across the board gains from the major indexes, DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000. Yesterday’s gains are consistent with historical trends for the first trading day of July. Over the past twenty-one years, July has on average begun with respectable gains. The second trading day has been weaker, but after this the major indexes have tended to trend solidly higher through mid-month to around the thirteenth trading day. At this point the major indexes have tended to weaken and trade sideways to lower to finish out the month.

&gt; # Sentiment Has Perked Up

&gt; Sentiment has taken a big step up in the past week. The AAII weekly sentiment survey saw 48.6% of respondents report as bullish this week, up 8.2 percentage points from last week for the highest reading since the week of April 22nd when over half of respondents reported as optimists. Not only is this week's reading ten percentage points above the historical average, but the one-week increase was the largest since an 11.1 percentage point jump during the week of April 8th. Similarly, the Investors Intelligence survey of newsletter writers saw bullish sentiment jump from 56.5% last week to an eight-week high of 59.6%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/07/070121-AAII-Bull.png)**

&gt; Considering bearish sentiment was already muted, that big increase in bullish sentiment was only met with a 1.1 percentage point decline in bearish sentiment. Only 22.2% of respondents reported as bearish this week, the lowest reading since June 10th.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/07/070121-AAII-Bear.png)**

&gt; While bearish sentiment did not experience a particularly large decline, it was an inverse move to bullish sentiment which resulted in the bull-bear spread climbing 9.3 points to the highest level since April 22nd. That means sentiment continues to largely favor the bulls. Prior to the past year, late 2017 and early 2018 was the only other period in recent years that the bull-bear spread was at similar levels to now.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/07/070121-AAII-Spread.png)**

&gt; Given the jump in bullish sentiment did not borrow from bearish sentiment, neutral sentiment took a significant hit this week falling 7.4 percentage points. That was both the biggest one-week decline and marks the lower level in neutral sentiment since April.

&gt; # Market Stronger Day Before than After Independence Day

&gt; Over the last 21 years, the trading day before Independence Day has been stronger than the day after. DJIA and S&amp;P 500 have advanced 66.7% of the time with average gains of 0.13% and 0.11% respectively on the day before. Based upon average performance, NASDAQ and Russell 2000 are slightly softer on the day before, but still lean bullish. On the trading day after Independence Day DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and Russell 2000 have declined more frequently than advanced. DJIA has recorded the fewest number of advances while Russell 2000 has the worst average performance with a 0.10% loss.

&gt; # Stocks Only Going Up In The First Half

&gt; One of the most remarkable aspects of the past six months has been the lack of a significant pullback. The S&amp;P 500 has not seen a 5% pullback since October, and since the start of the year, the most it had fallen from a high was 4.23% from mid-February to March 4th. Besides that and another smaller 4% pullback in May, it has been a one-way trip higher. Looking back through the history of the S&amp;P 500, there are not many other years in which the index went the entire first half without at least a 5% pullback. Below we show the chart of the S&amp;P 500 for each of the 14 years that, like this year, did not experience a pullback of at least 5% in the first half. . As shown, six of these (highlighted in green)—1954, 1958, 1964, 1993, 1995, and most recently 2017—actually did not see a 5% or larger pullback in the second half of the year either.

&gt; As for the other years, the S&amp;P 500 did generally tend to move higher for at least part of the second half, but there have been a range of declines. The year with the largest decline in the second half was 1986 when the index fell 9.42% in September. And that was after a 7.53% decline shortly after the midpoint of the year in the first two weeks of July. The 1959 occurrence similarly saw a 9.17% decline from August through September. While it did not necessarily all happen within the second half of the year, the declines in the final days of the 1961 occurrence actually marked the beginning of a bear market that ultimately would see the S&amp;P 500 fall 23.6% from its late 1961 peak.

stocks,"I’ve studied Finance and Data Science throughout college and use a variety of fundamental, technical, and financial strategies to select the best stocks for my personal portfolio. Over the past two years I’ve consistently underperformed the S&amp;P and greatly underperformed the NASDAQ (which I consider my benchmark given my heavy asset allocation in technology). 

This makes me wonder, why not just compose a portfolio of all ETF’s and indices. Was thinking of a combination of SPY, DIA, NDAQ, QQQ, ARKK, etc. maybe even incorporate sector ETF’s like QCLN/ICLN, THCX, IAU (gold, to hedge against inflation), and some small/mid-cap funds.

I feel like this strategy would help me diversify greatly and mitigate risk as much as possibly while generating above market returns. I’d probably go with something along the lines of 40% SPY, 30% QQQ, 15% ARKK, 5% QCLN, 5% THCX, 5% IAU. Aside from expense ratio fees I feel like this would help me beat the market and I can even incorporate automatic weekly deposits into the SPY and QQQ accordingly.

 Nubeva develops and licenses proprietary software for the decryption of network traffic. Nubeva’s next-generation SKI (Session Key Intercept) technology represents a better, faster, easier, and lower-cost alternative to legacy decryption.

Just a couple days ago, Nubeva announced that with the preview of Microsoft's Windows Server 2022, Nubeva validated that their patented decryption software was successful. As security is Microsoft's headline priority, it is the utmost importance to make sure that Nubeva software can be ran and successful on the new server being delivered later this year.

Nubeva plans to release GA decryption support at the time of Microsoft's system general availability.

Assets are more than double liabilities, and revenues are the highest the company has ever seen. More than 10x 2020's April 30 in the TTM.

Stocks rose once again, with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ) both recording new intraday highs amid the continued push by technology stocks. The Dow Jones (DIA) rose as well, but continued to lag behind the other two indexes. Market participants are encouraged by the June Jobs Report, which showed payroll gains rise more than expected. 

Today, the US Department of Labor released the Job June report, which showed a stronger-than-expected acceleration in hiring, with non-farm payrolls rising by 850,000, the sixth straight month of gains. The unemployment rate however, ticked slightly higher to 5.9%. Here are the numbers

* **Change in non-farm payrolls:** 850,000 vs. 720,000 expected and an upwardly revised 583,000 in May
* **Unemployment rate:** 5.9% vs. 5.6% expected and 5.8% in May 
* **Average hourly earnings, month-over-month:** 0.3% vs. 0.3% expected and a downwardly revised 0.4% in May
* **Average hourly earnings, year-over-year:** 3.6% vs. 3.6% expected and a downwardly revised 1.9% in May

President Biden said of the report, “This is historic progress, pulling our economy out of the worst crisis in 100 years, driven in part by our dramatic progress in vaccinating our nation and beating back the pandemic. Today, the US is the only major advanced economy where the OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) projections of future output are higher today than they were in January 2020 before the pandemic hit.”

Emily Roland, co-Chief Investment Strategist at John Hancock Investment Management said of the report, “This is the Goldilocks Report that the market was looking for today. You had a nice print here of 850,000 jobs being added, wage pressure remaining – I wouldn't call them necessarily contained – but surprising here on the downside versus consensus estimates. So this is telling us right now that economic growth is continuing to accelerate here, the jobs market is continuing to heal. We're making progress here in terms of what the Fed has set out to do, which is in order to get unemployment down, they're going to let inflation run a little bit hot here. Not too hot, not too cold – this is just what the market wants.""

This Job Report will give market participants a better idea as to the timing of the Federal Reserve’s next monetary policy. For now, the Fed has so far kept in place both of its key pandemic-era policies - quantitative easing at a clip of $120 billion a month and near-zero interest rates. However, the Fed has consistently said they are looking for a “string” of strong jobs reports, like the one this month before any adjustments to the current policy is made. If the Jobs Report continues being especially strong in the months ahead, it could force the Fed to taper quantitative easing earlier than originally telegraphed. I have said  before in the past I expect the Fed to begin tapering QE towards the end of the year and am not worried about that at all. For starters, the market has historically reacted very little to changes in QE ([see the 2013 Taper Tantrum here)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taper-tantrum.asp), it’s changes in the interest rate that really drive the market, and second, the Fed is expected to taper slowly, making any changes gradual.

**Highlights**

* Shares of AMC pulled back slightly after financial firm Iceberg Research announced they have opened a short position. Honestly, I have no idea why they did this, only opening themselves up to becoming WSB's next target. Will be interesting to see what happens moving forward.
* More bad news for Lordstown Motors, who have already been the subject of a short report that saw the company admit they had inflated the importance of preorders for the electric pickup truck and forced the CEO to leave. Now, the Justice Department has announced it is opening a probe into the company to investigate comments made by executives and the way the company represented its pre orders to shareholders. The whole EV market was down today in sympathy. 
* Tesla (TSLA) recorded its fifth straight quarter of vehicle delivery growth. In Q2, the company delivered 201,250 vehicles, missing expectations for 204,160, according to Bloomberg consensus data**,** but more than double the 90,891 vehicles delivered in the same period a year ago.
* The U.S. Federal Trade Commission filed a proposed consent order to settle antitrust charges against semiconductor maker Broadcom Inc, the agency said in a statement on Friday. The consent order requires Broadcom to stop demanding that its customers buy components mostly or only from Broadcom. The company responded, “While we disagree that our actions violated the law and disagree with the FTC’s characterizations of our business, we look forward to putting this matter behind us.""

Never brought anything risky and did not see much growth.


Then in 2016 I got a ‘Tech’ Job in Silicon Valley where Salary is heavy in RSU ( restricted stock unit) and employees can buy with ESPP ( 15% discount on fair market value)

That Company ( Company A) did really good in next 4 years and by 2020 I have around 500k in Vested stock + ESPP purchase. 
Never sold any.


Then in 2020 I got a job in one of the FAANG companies ( Company B) with even a bigger chunk of RSU + ESPP 


After first vest ( 2021) and espps in Company B, I have around 200k in this FAANG company stock.


So now my situation is :
I have only around 80k in my checking account. ( had little more but spent on a down payment)
Around 50k in 401k ( started in 2020 only, never before understood it + Company B has very good match) but funds selected are 100% stocks again.


500k stocks from previous company ( Company A)


200k stocks in current company B ( and more adding up every quarter by vesting + ESPP)


Another 150k in my personal trading account.


So 80k cash + 50k (401k … in stock funds 😞) + around ‘850k’ of pure stocks( and some option trading money )


Both the tech companies are good + long time players + have steady growth in earnings and not some loss making unicorns like Uber/Airbnb etc … but by any means their price looks overvalued ( Don’t know by how much, my current company B is one having 2T market cap yet no sign of stopping 😔)


I have huge ‘anxiety’ on what to do.

A) I don’t want to sell previous ( Company A ) and Current ( Company B) companies stocks with the ‘fear’ that they might grow even more.( Company A already 5x from original value in 2016)

B) Most of my last 6 years savings are bound to stock and although I was much younger to experience 1999/2008 crash but heard about them + all the predictions on inflation/another crash and SCARED to lose all these money if and when that happens.

I think this OPEC meeting signaled that crude is going to have an opportunity to leg up again, as US shale is not in a place to compete, giving OPEC control of the market for another few months.

am big on Exxon, but as inventories deplete, I believe we will see more gains on the services side of things rather than refiners and producers. I still am long shares/calls Exxon, Devon and Suncor though. 

I do still like the pipelines, mainly enbridge as well. The OIH is also a fantastic way to play this, but the options are very expensive which I believe signals the upside risk of near term crude volatility.",Schlumberger and halliburton,1625244487

stocks,"Let’s take a look at 4 commonly used ratios and why 2 of these ratios may tell a better story than the other 2:

**P/S** (Price to Sales): Price/ Sales per share or Market cap/ Sales

**P/E** (Price to Earnings): Price/ EPS (earnings per share) or Market Cap/ earnings

**EV/ NTM Sales** (Enterprise Value/ Next Twelve Months Sales): (Market cap + debt - cash &amp; cash equivalents)/ Next 12 months estimated sales

**EV/ EBITDA** (Enterprise Value/ Earnings\* before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization): (Market cap + debt - cash &amp; cash equivalents)/ Earnings\* before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization

\*Earnings is the amount of profit left after all expenses have been paid, mostly synonymous with net income.

&amp;#x200B;

Let’s compare using Market Capitalization in our ratios versus Enterprise Value.

**Market Cap**: Share price x Shares outstanding

**Enterprise Value**: Market cap + Debt - Cash &amp; Cash equivalents

Notice what Market Cap is missing? It doesn’t include a company’s debt. **Debt is inherently included in the value of a company, because if a company were to be bought out, the buyers would have to take on the debt obligation. Both the P/E and the P/S ratios don’t consider the amount of debt a company is obligated to pay**. This is why I prefer to use the EV/ NTM Sales ratio over the P/S ratio, and the EV/EBITDA ratio over the P/E ratio, as it gives a more accurate representation of a company’s worth.

Cash and cash equivalents are subtracted in the EV formula because it is assumed they are already included when calculating market cap. Think of it like this: If you bought a company for $10,000, but that company had $2,000 of cash on hand, your “real” cost to buy the company would be $8,000 since you would have access to the company’s cash after buying it.

DD : Mildest from Webull 
TWITTER : @1AJ

According to Data from
https://nakedshortreport.com
( Follow the pictures of the post )
( There’s 2 because merge wasn’t finish and Data comes out for $TRCH &amp; $MMAT )

Shorts haven’t covered &amp; I have proof that we will squeeze with certain requirements.

Choice 1: Massive Volume 
Choice 2: Exhaust The Shorts 

Choice 1: 

With massive volume, we can squeeze the shorts, Data from $AMC ( Circled in the picture ) on June 2
 
272,472,248 (Us)	122,341,498 ( Them	44.92

As you can see, they didn’t have enough to cover our volume, how did they do this? With a catalyst.
On June 2 this was announced 
“As of June 2, AMC had 501,780,240 shares outstanding that will be entitled to a vote at the upcoming Shareholder Meeting” 

This attracted buyers and caught them off guard pushing the price to ATH and settling at a new support of $54-$57 

How does this apply to $MMAT?!?

Our catalyst for this push is this 

“@Metamaterialtec management will hold a live webcast presentation on Tuesday, July 6th, at 1PM EDT, to discuss recent events and META's future #growth initiatives.”
 
What do we need them to say? We need them to announce something worth getting buyers attentions and pushing a rally of buyers, what could this be?

The Tesla partnership, them confirming they’re supplying / working with them, anyone who’s done dd or follows me on webull knows I’ve been posting and pushing this so people can findout,. Once the stock market finds out we should see a push form buyers and since we are shorted this should attract yup you guess it wall street bets. 

What happens if I don’t sell on the squeeze? We will reach all time highs and a new average, the company still works and provides for them as they have a contact with them until like 2026, our page over at twitter: @TRCHXMETA has this information and pretty much confirms this.
Positive we will still be fighting shorts but with this company being under the wing with Tesla and making an estimate of 10B in revenue, we couldn’t be worry for a dump. We are also added to the Russell 3000, that’s why we were added to the NASDAQ.

That’s is the conclusion of choice 1.

Choice 2 is basically keep hitting these guys with buying power until they give up, eventually they’ll have such a high borrow fee that it will squeeze just like AMC in January, failure to do this will allow shorts to cover and we will be holding for much longer until other catalyst come, just like how AMC ran out of juice from $20 to $5 and holding for about 4-5 months until it happened again and the battle starting over again. So far we are able to keep them above at 40% fee since we manage to have volume in the millions.

Thanks for reading and I would like your output on this, I’m mostly looking forward to choice 1 as you can see.",$MMAT / $TRCH Squeeze &amp; Tesla Partnership Plan,1625233527

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

See the following word cloud and click through for the wiki:

If you have a basic question, for example ""what is EBITDA,"" then google ""investopedia EBITDA"" and click the Investopedia article on it; do this for everything until you have a more in depth question or just want to share what you learned.

Thanks, Microsoft. I prefer some real non-patronizing, verbosity that actually tells me wtf is going on. Oh, and have you used a 15 year old Windows XP machine?

I know Linux does Live OS' too.

But the reason I'm bullish on MSFT is because our government is bullish on MSFT for security. Ever since that solarwinds BS hack. I always pay attention to those subsidies. It's why corn wheat and soy is so big in the US. MSFT is just another corn/wheat/soy stock. A genetically modified OS.

stocks,"Hello everyone and thank you for taking the time to view this post. Every now and then we come across a company that captivates us, where the story sounds good, the opportunity sounds good... and then we either do not have the money to cease the opportunity or we may have missed out. Here is a company who reported June 30th and is delivering absolutely amazing results but the stock is not being rewarded.

EZGO focused on Ebikes in China. They reported 6 month their 1st Half results (September 1st 2020 until March 31st 2021)  days ago. Initially the stock jolted from 4.35 to 5.15...... Yesterday it closed near 4! This is a 40% frop from 3 months ago when it was trading over 7. Why this matters is the company now has much better prospects and has now delivered solid results.

The sales for the first 6 months were 9.6 million a 75% growth over the same period a year before. Bike sales increased 100% to 34,000+ units.. This company as a whole is valued at 50 million. Their fiscal 2020 year total sales were 16 million. The CEO has said in February sales should be about 100,000.

These results reported June 30th did not include a big sales of over 10,000 bikes to Ukraine April 1st. This also did not include a 10,000 bike order on April 15th from a bike Expo. These results also did not include a 5,000 bike order from a distributor at the end of April. In April alone we are looking at 25,000+ bike sales which almost eclipses the previous 6 month total!

The company has introduced higher margin bikes. Also, the growth on the 3 wheel bikes was actually 600 percent. The company actually lost 487,000 in 2020 period or 6 cents a share on 5.5 million in sales. The fact that they increased sales and lost less is amazing. This time was 9.6 million sales and a loss of 358,00 or 4 cents a share. 

On June 15th the company closed on a new facility with 5x the production capacity. Remember, the CEO had a 100,000 bike forecast in February before the large orders in April. It is my belief that he knows the company will sell way more than 100,000 bikes. April alone we are looking at 25,000+ bikes and the previous 6 months were 34,000. That is already 60k bikes with 5 more months to go..

I am long EZGO and the company is absolutely executing. This stock was near 20, but it is now affordable for everyone. If you have any questions or thoughts please share. Since the last report in February which was also good the stock is down 50%.","75% Overall Revenue Growth, 100% Sales Growth, lowered loss per share to 4 cents from 6, stock is down 40% 3 months, EZGO, Reported June 30",1625202204

Instead of paying down the mortgage you should invest the extra payments. Which theoretically, mathematically makes sense. Even the smoothest of brains should be able to get 4% return. So if your APR is 3% and you pay off early, you're basically throwing away 1% and quite possibly much much more.

stocks,"Airlines have been getting hammered recently due to the Delta variant, which makes sense why it’s hard to get good revenue when things open up and then close back down again. One of the first airlines to announce their earnings is Southwest and American. Southwest being only domestic to United States really, still seems like the preferred travel in terms of ease and customer service.

Currently their price sits at $53.84 as of July 1, and they just endured a brutal month that took them down almost 13%. They seem to be making a comeback after recent news on Boeing 737 purchases from other airlines and increased demand for the summer flights. I see this making a nice steady upward movement for the summertime as flights become more and more packed domestically. If you can’t fly international, many will want to get out of their area still somewhere in the states. 

I’m thinking this month they could hit $57-$58 before earnings, and I fully expect earnings to be good since most of their travel isn’t disrupted by international borders being closed. 

Gas prices are going up though, and the Middle East basically emphasized that there will be less oil than more circulating for now. This could eat at airline costs, also stunting their growth. 

Southwest is hovering still somewhere close to pre-pandemic levels and never really broke out to new levels. I’m thinking airlines will make a comeback this month as summer travel proves to be desired.

stocks,"I've been struggling these past few months at settling on a portfolio that I was happy with. I am young (23), so I wanted my investments to take advantage of that by being more aggressive with growth. At the same time, I realize that the current market is overextended, and a lot of the companies I really like are trading with a lot of that growth priced in. So, I wanted to put together a portfolio that would satisfy my risk/reward tolerance without having to pay a hefty premium.

The two pieces of advice that I greatly resonate with are:

1. Invest in a great company at a good price &gt; good company at a great price
2. concentration builds wealth, diversification preserves it

So I wanted to keep the number of stocks low (&lt;10) and put my money in companies for which I have high conviction. I started out by first creating a list of sectors that I think are best set up for hyper-growth in the next 10-20 years. For me, those are:

* Tech &gt; Information &amp; Communications / AI, AR, and Automation / Cyber Security
* Financial Services &gt; FinTech
* Healthcare &gt; Health Tech &amp; Genomics
* Consumer Cyclicals &gt; Internet Retail / Gambling
* EVs

Obviously, that list is not exhaustive, but those are the areas I feel the most comfortable with and in which I can see the long-term potential. I used that list as a starting point to look into companies and solidify the ones that will make up my portfolio. Some of the positions are more speculative than others, but I have found to have a compelling enough business model for me to invest in. If you have any criticism or suggestions, please comment below! I'm always looking to learn and discover great companies!

# Portfolio Holdings:

**FB**

For me, this was a no-brainer. The fundamentals are absurdly strong; pretty much no debt with a boatload of free cash. Consistent share buybacks (although not much) and increase in revenue. Outside of the main platform, it owns Instagram and Whatsapp which are incredibly sticky apps. Not to mention all the other projects they have going on (Occulus, FB Watch, etc.). What appealed to me the most was the fact that their ROIC is one of the best compared to the other FAANG stocks. There's also still room for ARPU to grow, especially on the international level. Instagram is also getting reworked to increase monetization. This stock is still undervalued/fairly valued and has, in my opinion, a lot more growth compared to some of the other FAANG companies.

&amp;#x200B;

**SOFI**

I wanted a piece of the fintech space, but the industry leaders PYPL and SQ are way too expensive for me to justify starting a position now. Comparatively, SOFI is trading way below their multiples and there's a lot to like about this company. With SPACs, a lot of the time the fundamentals do not match up to the hype they receive. However, SOFI's Q1 report showed tremendous YOY growth with promising guidance. They also show an increase in the number of users that use more than one of their services, which is an extremely important part of their identity. Now bears may say that this company lacks a moat because traditional banks can just enter the space easily, however, that's not considering one of the most compelling parts of this company, which is their acquisition of Galileo, a payment processor that is integrated with over 90% digital banks in North America and over 70 of the top 100 FinTech companies. So, even as more competitors enter the space, SOFI stands to benefit from that.

Not to mention their management team is stacked with talent. What really sealed the deal for me was the vision of CEO Anthony Noto. In a recent interview, Noto states that the reason SOFI hasn't gone international, despite the interest, is that they wanted to keep refining the product and make sure it can suit the user as best as it can before expanding overseas. This is a CEO that really cares about what they're building and the people who use it.

There's a lot of tailwinds for this company, and even if the fed does increase interest rates in 2022/23, they only stand to benefit.

&amp;#x200B;

**DKNG**

This position hinges on political policy, but I'm optimistic about it given how smooth the process of legalizing online betting in the US has been so far. The balance sheet may not be the cleanest, but companies like these typically spend a lot upfront in the form of CACs, and they've done an amazing job in that regard at making this company a household brand. Q1 2021 reports that monthly unique payers (MUPs) increased 114% yoy.

There's so much growth ahead in the short and long term. Over half the country has legalized betting (in some shape) in 3 years. The gambling market size is predicted to undergo hyper-growth in the next 10 years. Furthermore, DKNG has expressed interest in the esports scene, which is also something that has and will see explosive growth.

With that all said, I don't think the stock is cheap, and there are definitely a lot of risks here, but I believe in what they've done so far and can see a lot of upside in the long term.

&amp;#x200B;

**ABBV**

I was between this and BMY, and I might end up just going 50/50 in both. Great fundamentals, a lot to like. Strong top-line revenue growth yoy and a lot of free cash flow. Share buybacks every year, except for the most recent when they issued shares to raise money for their acquisition. There's some concern that HUMIRA, their most popular drug which makes up about 50% of their revenue, has its exclusivity period ending 2023, but their recent acquisition of Allergen positions them well for the future. ABBV is certainly not a crazy hypergrowth stock, but they still have room for growth and their dividend is king. Especially now, when it's trading at a very reasonable valuation, it's a great time to buy in.

&amp;#x200B;

**BABA**

I'm sure this stock needs no explanation on this sub. I really think this stock, or the likes of TENCHY, belongs in every portfolio that's focused on long-term growth at a reasonable price. So unless you're extremely against Chinese companies and the risk they may present, this is an absolute steal at these prices. In fact, right now most U.S companies are overvalued whereas almost every Chinese stock is undervalued.

&amp;#x200B;

**COIN**

I stayed far away from buying into this company when it IPO'd. Now it has fallen to a pretty reasonable valuation, so I decided to start a small position. I hold a small crypto portfolio myself and although I don't think crypto will replace fiat money, I still see a lot of potential in it long term for a variety of uses. If you don't believe in crypto at all, then it's a lot harder to justify buying into this company.

COIN itself is one of the most popular crypto exchanges and they posted blistering numbers in their 2021 Q1 report. Granted, a lot of that was tied to the initial explosion of crypto in mainstream media, but the conservative projections for the full year of 2021 are still great. Crypto is still in its infancy in terms of mainstream support and use and the potential TAM is massive.

That said in the short term, there will be a lot of volatility with this stock. That's why I'm starting with a very small position, with the intention to add if the numbers and guidance continue to impress. Bear cases made of COIN usually rests on the fact that there is nothing proprietary about COIN or that they depend too heavily on transaction fees, which I fully acknowledge, but they have the name recognition and the biggest userbase, and it'll be up to their management team to make the right moves and continue to innovate. I'm still learning about the crypto space, but there's a lot more than just a means of exchange.

&amp;#x200B;

**CLF**

American steel. Steel futures have been unstoppable lately, with the re-opening and word that an infrastructure deal is in the works, there's a lot to like about steel. News of China pulling back from steel exports also allows American steel to be more competitive in the marketplace. Yet, despite all these catalysts, the prices of companies like CLF are still lagging behind. This is not your typical growth play, and I personally see this as a short-term (6-12 months) position, due to steel's cyclical nature. I'll also admit I got into this a few months before when CLF was sitting at 18 a share. Still, CLF is poised to gain a lot, and quite a lot to like about this company. The management team under Lourenco Goncalves has revitalized CLF, making big acquisitions of AK Steel and ArcelorMittal USA. He's also recently gone and raised Q2 2021 guidance, and there's reason to believe that even that was conservative for how hot the industry is currently. 

If you're interested in learning more about the thesis behind steel, I'd suggest checking out r/Vitards. Anyways, I don't know if I'm going to hold this position for say 10+ years, so I'll be looking to capitalize on some short-term gains and use those profits to either open up a new position or fuel my current investments.

&amp;#x200B;

**TDOC**

This is also a very speculative position, similar to COIN. After the major pullback, I believe TDOC is at a very fair evaluation. Despite posting another quarter without profit, there's a lot to like about this company. They have one of the highest NPS scores, significantly greater than AMZN and APPL, which is something that's very compelling and which is something the balance sheet doesn't reflect. Combine that with the fact that they have captured a big chunk of the market, with healthcare professionals and big institutions, makes the company very, very sticky. Even if it only is the ""Zoom for healthcare,"" the quality is strong enough that users won't just drop it for just any other substitute. 

But it's not just the ""Zoom for healthcare"". The acquisitions it has made, both BetterHelp and Livongo, have amazing implications and have yet to show their full potential on TDOC's balance sheet. There's still so much of the healthcare space that can be innovated, and TDOC is primed to take over.

For right now, I'm OK with TDOC being unprofitable even with the pandemic pushing it along so well. That tells me they're funneling their revenue back into research and development to continue to build up its services and revenue streams.

I also believe that telehealth is still in its infancy, and even though it was massively adopted during COVID, that only accelerates its long-term use and adoption by a little bit. It's going to take a while before it becomes sophisticated enough for people to see the value. This is a long-term play to which I will be consistently adding.

&amp;#x200B;

**BARK**

Barkbox features in delivering monthly care packages for dogs on a subscription basis. This is something that's not as hyped as EVs, but pet care is a fast-growing market that sees more spending each year. In fact, quarantine boosted the number of pet owners in the US dramatically. Barkbox has seen tremendous yoy growth in revenue and subscriptions, with a CAGR, gross margins, and a returning customer rate that beats the industry leader CHWY as well as other popular brands. BARK has made a lot of partnerships with the likes of AMZN, WMT, TGT, etc., and looks to continue to expand vertically in the space of dog hygiene/medicine/food. All of this while trading at a much lower multiple than the other big pet care brands. 

The management team is fantastic. Manish Joneja, CEO of BARK, has 2 decades of experience as director of Amazon global exports and expansion and 5+ years on eBay as product lead. Carly Strife and Henrik Werdelin have been featured in Forbes 30 under 30 and Top 100 Most Creative/Top 100 people in tech, respectively. 

The bear case of this company is that they have no moat, but their customer retention speaks a lot to brand loyalty and satisfaction. CHWY also has a box subscription service for dogs, however, it's nowhere close to as popular as BARK. BARK is also expanding internationally, starting first with Australia.

Will it get to where CHWY is? That part isn't clear and it depends on how well BARK is able to build on what it has and expand what it has to offer. But the stock has a lot of room to run given the current valuation, and the product is sticky enough to either allow them to succeed or be a target for an acquisition.

stocks,"TL;DR - Short TF out of this or buy puts once available. A company riddled with a history of fraud, misleading investors, and deceitful accounting tactics is being dumped to the public by a large private equity firm.

My god, this is one of the most blatant cash outs I’ve ever seen. CNBC was pumping this name all morning and interviewed their CEO who touted its new “Omni channel” strategy that will lead to better margins. My BS meter started going off so I decided to read their S-1 and see what was going on under the hood.

Krispy Kreme used to be public in the 2000’s and was acquired by JAB Holdings in 2016 for $1.35 billion following numerous scandals of channel stuffing and overstating revenues. Execs would pretty much order shipments of donuts to be sent to franchises and claim sales to meet quarterly estimates. Wild. There are other irregular accounting techniques used throughout the years along with bullying tactics used against franchise owners but you get the picture, won’t go into detail.

So now after a few years of being private sprinkled with an acquisition (Insomnia Cookies), execs/JAB decided it was time to cash out.

In the presentation, Krispy Kreme emphasizes its strong revenue growth. This is a trap. Their organic growth is flat +1% at most when you strip out revenues from their debt heavy acquisition which is why their margins are just awful now and will not improve. It also excludes new shops that were recently opened because it does not matter if you are growing as a company if you can’t achieve economies of scale. You see this a lot with companies who know they can’t be profitable - emphasize revenue growth! 

Krispy Kreme shouldn’t trade at more than 1x its revenue until it proves it can be profitable through some miraculous turnaround. At a $3 billion market cap currently, I forecast it is nearly 40% overvalued. This should be a $10 stock. Whoever the lead underwriter was for this IPO deserves a raise after pulling such a ridiculous multiple. I guess that’s why companies go public when the market is at all-time highs.",Do not fall for Krispy Kreme’s IPO trap: A legacy brand with no organic growth that will remain unprofitable,1625181408

Board of Directors want changes and have proved it again this month...

**We are writing to you today to once again urge you to vote to re-elect all five members of the Board at the Company’s upcoming Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the “Annual Meeting”) on** **July 16, 2021. In our view, maintaining boardroom continuity can help the Company achieve the following:**

* **Support the ongoing** **Food and Drug Administration** **(“FDA”) review of our ZIMHI™** **New Drug Application.**
* **Advance our Phase 2/3 trial for examining the effects of Tempol on COVID-19.**
* **Support ongoing efforts to obtain government funding for Tempol.**
* **Advance the Investigational New Drug for Tempol’s use in radiation dermatitis.**
* **Demonstrate a further increase in SYMJEPI® sales.**
* **Maintain a strong capital position and healthy balance sheet.**
* **Prioritize progress across our entire product pipeline.**

**Based on our decades of collective experience in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical sectors, we firmly believe that Adamis is nearing a promising inflection point**\*\*. We contend it is not the time to deviate from these priorities. The progress we are beginning to catalyze for SYMJEPI®, ZIMHI™ and now Tempol stems from months and years of planning and work. This is the time to remain focused on – not pull back from – the efforts we are undertaking.\*\*

**Unfortunately,** **Jerald A. Hammann** **– a holder of 1,000 shares with no industry expertise, no public company experience and no articulated plan – is trying to remove and replace 80% of your Board.** **We believe a more effective way for stockholders to communicate concerns is to write to the Company directly instead of seemingly throwing away a vote on Mr. Hammann’s misguided effort.**

**We urge stockholders not to be misled for a number of reasons, including:**

* **Mr. Hammann** **initially demanded a lucrative and unjusitified paid consulting agreement – which would have been paid for with stockholders’ capital – before he was even a stockholder of the Company.**
* **Mr. Hammann** **threatened to make books and records demands and to run a campaign against the Board if we did not quickly agree to award him the demanded consulting agreement.**
* **Mr. Hammann** **has no operating experience in the biotechnology or pharmaceutical sector.**
* **Mr. Hammann** **has no experience as a director or executive of a public company.**
* **Mr. Hammann** **has a history of filing serial lawsuits and being a vexatious litigator.**
* **Mr. Hammann** **submitted an untimely and invalid notice of director nominations. His nominations will not be accepted at the Annual Meeting.**
* **Mr. Hammann** **unsuccessfully sued the Company in an attempt to delay the Annual Meeting and forced us to expend precious stockholder capital on fending off litigation.**
* **Mr. Hammann** **has no plan for the Company.**

**We hope stockholders recognize that supporting Mr. Hammann’s misguided campaign would be akin to taking what we believe is a major risk. Rather than support a litigious stockholder that is waging a costly and distracting battle with the Company, we urge you to reject his efforts by voting to re-elect your current Board.**

**Once again, we thank you for your investment in Adamis. We firmly believe that the Company is on the right path now that we have tangible pipeline momentum. Vote on the** **WHITE** **proxy card** **to elect our full five-member slate and help us sustain the Company’s progress.**

The rally in stocks continued, with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) once again recording fresh intraday highs in the first trading day of the third quarter. The Nasdaq (QQQ) closed roughly even, as the rally in technology stocks takes a breather. The Dow Jones (DIA), which lagged the other two major indexes for all of June, continued its recovery. 

Market participants are encouraged a stronger-than-expected gain on private payrolls and tempered inflationary fears. Looking ahead, market participants wait for Q2 earnings season and the incoming June Jobs Report, which is expected to be released tomorrow. 

ADP’s June private payroll report showed private payrolls increased faster than expected[.](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/adp-june-private-payrolls-jobs-market-pandemic-economy-recovery-121542029.html) This underscores the ongoing economic recovery with the US economy reporting its sixth straight monthly increase in employment. Job openings rose by 692,000 versus the 600,000 expected. Consumer confidence has also risen and pointed to Americans' increased propensity to spend, with the Conference Board's consumer confidence index racing to its highest level since February 2020. 

During the second quarter, the technology, communication, real estate, and energy sectors were the best performers, underscoring the rotation from “reopening” and cyclical stocks that led the market higher earlier in the year back into technology and growth stocks. The rotation coincided with tempered fears, with the market rocketing higher after an initial 4% sell-off following the release of the April Consumer Price Index. It seems the market has now accepted Powell and other monetary official’s narrative that current inflationary pressures are “transitory” and due mostly to pandemic-induced disruptions.

Looking ahead, market participants wait for the June Jobs Report and are gearing up for Q2 earnings season, with earnings expected to continue being super-charged by stronger than expected demand from savings-loaden consumers and the continued reopening of the US economy thanks to effective distribution of the coronavirus vaccine. So far, analysts are looking for S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 61.9% year-on-year in aggregate, according to FactSet data – an estimate UBS's Head of Equity Derivatives Research Stuart Kaiser said may still be ""need to be revised higher."" 

**Highlights**

* Robinhood filed its S-1 Prospectus, marking a significant step forward as the company prepares for an upcoming IPO using the ticker HOOD. According to the S-1, Robinhood has 17.7 million monthly active users, with nearly 50% of those being first-time investors. Total revenue grew 245% to $959 million between the end of December 2019 and December 2020. The company was profitable in 2020, improving from a loss in 2019, but lost $1.4 billion in the first three months of 2021 amid the Gamestop frenzy that happened earlier in the year. This will be very interesting to watch, I have my popcorn out and ready to see what unfolds. 
* Shares of donut-maker Krispy Kreme (DNUT) popped in today’s IPO, with the stock rising roughly 23% after trading became open to the public.
* U.S. manufacturing sector activity retreated more than expected in June, reaching the lowest level since January. The Institute for Supply Management's June purchasing managers' index, a monthly indicator of U.S. economic activity based on a survey of purchasing managers at more than 300 manufacturing firms, fell to 60.6. This came following a print of 61.2 in May, and came in below the 60.9 expected, according to Bloomberg consensus data. As long as the number is over 50 though, it shows growth in the sector. 
* Facebook (FB) has teamed up with French video game maker Ubisoft Entertainment SA to bolster its cloud-gaming platform with popular titles such as ""Assassin's Creed"". In recent weeks competition for cloud-based gaming platforms between mega-cap tech stocks has intensified, with Google, Microsoft, and Amazon (AMZN) all ramping up their efforts.
* Chinese ride-hailing giant Didi (DIDI) rose roughly 15% today, recovering after a disappointing IPO debut yesterday. 
* Megan Thee Stallion is following in the footsteps of fellow celebrity Miley Cyrus by partnering with financial payments company Square (SQ) Cash App to give away $1 million worth of stock to her fans, another sign the push for retail investors and education is going ever more mainstream.

Whether the squeeze happens or not, AMC's pricing cannot be sustained in the $50-$60 range. If it squeezes the pricing will crater shortly. If it doesn't squeeze, Reddittors will lose interest and the pricing will come down as demand craters.

Risks:

**AMC follows a TSLA like model where the pricing never falls down** to natural fundamental driven levels. What if AMC keeps getting reloaded by shorters with the same investment thesis that AMC is bound to fall. As SI climbs back up, Reddit notices and it drives back up demand on this proven squeeze stock with a large community. However, AMC has no explosive growth potential since the theater business has a near realized saturation. AMC has no gigafactory or fancy roof solar panels that is beyond their core business.

AMC Squeeze Saga continues on for another six months. There is a real risk that this keeps going on for another six months where pricing never falls back down because both sides won't blink.

Conclusion:

It seems whether the third AMC squeeze happens or not, within six months (Dec or Jan strike) the pricing levels seems like it should fall. Maybe to at least the $25-35 range.

Competitors: Compared to competitors including OFG Bancorp (OFG), First Bancorp North Carolina (FBNC), Community Bank System Inc (CBU), and US Bancorp (USB), Popular, Inc. has a lower price to earnings ratio (P/E), indicating that BPOP may be underpriced in the short-term 

&amp;#x200B;

#  Valuation &amp; Financial Analysis 

Share Price v. Fair Value: Considering BPOP’s current stock price of $76.36, BPOP may be undervalued based on the cashflows the company is expected to generate in the future. Trading below fair value indicates possible upside potential.

 Price to Earnings Ratio: Measuring the current share price relative to BPOP’s earnings per share, the company’s PE of approximately 8.61 is lower than the Industry (12) and Market (19.7), indicating BPOP is possibly undervalued. While not a measure of future performance, BPOP’s earnings growth has exceeded both the overall industry and market over the past year. Factoring BPOP’s forecasted annual earnings growth and forecasted annual revenue growth, both metrics may lag the overall industry and market over the next 3 years. 

Debt to Equity Analysis: With a Debt/Equity Ratio of 22.7% (as of March 30, 2021), there have been significant improvements since July 29, 2014 when BPOP had a Debt/Equity Ratio of 105.4%, indicating increased assets and reduced liabilities during that timeframe. Additionally, with an Assets to Equity Ratio of 11.3, BPOP is financing its operations through a moderate level of debt versus wholly-owned funds.

 Dividends: With an annual dividend amount of $1.80 per share and a dividend yield of 2.29%, BPOP’s dividend yield is in line with the market median of 2.26%. While dividend payments have been stable and increased for 5 years in a row, BPOP has only  paid a dividend for 6 consecutive years. With a low payout ratio of approximately 18.4%, BPOP’s dividend payments are well covered by earnings and future payouts to shareholders are forecasted to be well covered in the next 3 years.

stocks,"For the purpose of this post you can call me a stock market beach bum, or bum for short.  Because what I want to describe is very much like surfing, and my role is that of a beach bum.

As a beach bum you can picture me sleeping on the beach with my surfboard.  Occasionally I may wake up and study the surf.  If it looks promising I might holler ""Surf's Up!"".  But even if I do, I may or may not decide to hop up and run out into the waves.  The point of hollering is to let the other bums on the beach know that they might want to check out the waves themselves.  There is no expectations from other bums.  They might let me know that they are headed out to catch a wave. They might not. And just like me they might holler out and yet not move. They might not feel energetic enough, or are simply need more inspiration; no expectations, no requirements.

What the heck am I talking about, right?  I am talking about something that I think many people might find to be a fun and exciting way to play the stock market.  The point of playing this way isn't to make money really, but you might just happen to do that too.  It's fun. It's exciting. It's a lot like surfing.  People (mostly) don't surf to make money either.  To ""surf the stock market"" you must wake up early, as most of the ""waves"" hit during the premarket hours.

Here's how it works:

1. When you wake up, look at what stocks are trading with the most volume and/or the biggest price changes for the day already.
2. If you find a stock that is both up by a very high percentage and that stock has significantly exceeded the average volume for the day even though the market has not opened yet, you can holler out ""surf's up!"".
3. Just like in real surfing, you then decide if or when to catch that wave, i.e. when or if you want to buy in to see how far you can ride it.
4. As soon as you buy in, look for how/when to sell. Expect your ride to be short, just like real surfing.

During premarket trading you probably cannot execute a full variety of buy/sell orders, so you definitely don't want to go big the first time you try this.  If I buy in during premarket I use a limit order with a limit price that is significantly above the last price I've seen.  That ends up acting like a market order, i.e. it gets filled quickly at the current premarket price.  Selling during premarket can be done in a similar fashion if you choose to stay awake and alert, which you probably should do. Once the market opens you can use stop limit orders if you want to fly blind, or simply keep watching and put in a market sell order when you want out.

As I said, it's exciting.  But it isn't necessarily going to make you any money. And if you buy big you could have a little too much of that excitement or dismay when you crash on the rocks. So far I've used very small quantities of money.  My goal is to see how big of percentages I can achieve.  The most exciting wave earned about 130 percent in 8 minutes when my stop triggered.  Maybe someday I will put real money into this game, but I surely won't recommend that you do.",Surfing The Stock Market for fun and excitement,1625163471

stocks,"Having worked for equity research desks over the last few years, I wanted to write-up my thoughts and methodology as to how I look at potential opportunities, and some of the sources you can use to help you do that.

# The initial screen

Before assessing an opportunity in great detail, I quickly look at 3 main elements:

1. **Company profile**  
What is the company? what do they do? what sector are they in? how long have they been around for? how many employees do they have?  
There isn’t anything specific i’m looking for at this stage, but I’m just building an understanding of the stock such that all research I do from then on has context behind it.
2. **The technicals and charts**  
Look at the price history of the company, what’s the 3 month, 1 year and 5 year trends? how did the price perform during previous crashes? (2008 for example) did it recover quickly? has the price been trending downwards for a while now, if so what levels could it recover to?  
For example, I use TradingView to quickly look at price history and trends, in this case for AAPL. I drew a parallel channel based on where the recent bottoms and tops have been, allowing me to see price ranges over the last 9 months. I use this as a rough guide to where the current price is at for the stock.
3. **Price upside &amp; analyst ratings**  
Analysts usually give a target price and buy rating for companies, I use this as an indicator for possible upside and overall quality. After all, these people spend all day doing this, and some of the big equity research houses can really impact a stock price based on their grading.

# The main checks

If the company passes the checks above, I move on to looking at the opportunity in more detail, looking at the following:

1. **News, coverage &amp; sentiment**  
Search the opportunity online, what are people saying about it? What recent news has it had? Read through comments on Yahoo Finance, Twitter, Reddit, StockTwits. Try and read both bullish and bearish commentary so you get a good idea for both sides of the argument.
2. **Revenue &amp; Earnings**  
This is important, ultimately, every business wants to become profitable and grow that profit year on year. Have a look through income figures and growth rates, how does it compare to competitors in the same sector? How has that fared during the pandemic? If there’s been massive growth recently, will that sustain long-term? What are analyst expectations, are they low/high? Why?  
Do the same for Revenue. This is slightly less important than income, but can start to inform you about cost bases, is the company growing revenue heavily but little profit growth? Is that investment for future profit? How long in the future? do they have a high profit margin?
3. **Financials**  
You want to assess the health of the company’s finances and balances (good EPS ratio, cashflow, debt ratios, debt maturity, quick ratio, book value etc).  
Here you are trying to assess financial red flags and signs of good capital management. Does the company have a lot of debt? is it due soon? How will this company fare during a crash? How did it manage through COVID? Does the company have enough cash to survive big losses? Does anything not add up on their balance sheet?
4. **Valuations**  
Build up an indication to how the stock is priced (PEG ratio, P/E ratio, P/CF, P/B etc, this article helps explain the ratios), is the company over-valued? under-valued? How does it compare to the market it’s in? How does it fare compared to sector competitors? Can you identify reasons for valuations? (some companies trade “at a discount“ because investors are not sure about the company’s future or management for example).
5. **Competitors &amp; Sector**  
Have a look at the direct competitors, how are they performing? are they priced similarly to your opportunity? if not, why? how does the company you’re assessing stack up? what is this company’s “moat”? what differentiates them from their rival? how hard is it to compete with this company? Look at the overall sector too, how will it fare long-term? What drivers could affect the sector?
6. **Employee ownership &amp; trading**  
Look at how much equity the employees of the company own, especially the executives, are they highly remunerated based on stock price? If they are equity weighted it’s in their best interest to increase the share price, some executives check their price every hour… Are they generally buying or selling the stock?
7. **Stock liquidity &amp; size**  
What’s the market cap of the company? Does it have sufficient volume traded? lower market cap/ volume companies are more volatile and sensitive to big trades, meaning you could lose more or not be able to get your money out quickly.
8. **Company management**  
What’s the background of the CEO and executive board? do they have sufficient experience in the sector? What do employees think of the CEO? have a look through Glassdoor for reviews on management styles and culture.
9. **Ownership structure**  
Try to assess how the company is owned and managed, what's the share structure? How many institutions hold this company? have they recently purchased or sold a large chunk? Are there large chunks of preferential shares that could impact your position or return? What’s the history of investors? Have they invested in ‘pumps and dumps’ ?
10. **Price history/ Technical analysis**  
At this point, you should have a good understanding of the company’s health, future plans, history, balance sheet and management. While all of those things could be positive, the price history of the stock could still be a blocker. Do some technical analysis on the opportunity, what’s the price history? long-term trend? RSI and stochastic indicators? MACD, bollinger bands etc.

# The unconventional checks

The above covers off a lot of the foundational and straightforward checks you should perform for any investment opportunity, and should provide you with a good starting point for you to do further research if needed.

Having said that, great research into opportunities doesn’t stop here. The above might not tell the full story, especially when you are looking at opportunities with limited history or data (penny stocks for example). In that instance, it’s necessary to do some unconventional research and think outside the box.

Some of these points are inspired by a [reddit post I found](https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/lwvisz/7_unconventional_ways_to_dd/), which I highly recommend you read.

1. **Look in places/ ask questions others won’t**  
There's always something to learn from research even if you don't end up making an investment in a company. Curiosity makes an excellent research partner.  
Try to pick out holes in the company and research, what could go wrong? what are people overlooking? What have you not covered? Does anything not feel right? Why?  
This will be difficult to do at first, as you are unsure what to cover and what feels right. The point here is, a lot of the research you do should be unsuccessful, but it helps develop your sense for the market, and will allow you to sniff out iffy looking investments/figures.
2. **If they offered you a role, would you work for them?**  
Usually you can tell alot about the company and its likelihood for success from the management team and their approach. That’s why professional institutions spend a lot of time focussing on and meeting the upper management.  
What’s their track record? How do they come across in interviews? How do they reward and talk about their employees? Would you work for them?  
Try and assess the equity structure of the company. Is the company set up in a way that it's easy to benefit the CEO, Investors and Preferred shareholders and the expense of common stockholders? Do insiders get rewarded with equity, making the success of the company their personal gain too?
3. **Model the extremes, both risk and upside**  
Try to gain an idea of what happens in the best and worst case scenario. How much could you lose and how much could you gain? Thinking like this sometimes gives you ideas of “asymmetric risk“.  
Look for opportunities where the upside/downsides are unbalanced, and structure your whole portfolio that way too (don’t lump all in on risky investments, but some potentials which could really boost gains.)
4. **Project potential, not just finances**  
One of the best performing funds for the last decade, Scottish Mortgages Investment Trust, was built on the thesis that “big changes in technology can provide large revolutions to lifestyle and capability, changing the way we live and operate“  
The notion here is that some companies can fundamentally change the game, and with it, revenue and earnings. Try to forecast Amazon’s current revenue 20 years ago, it was unthinkable for an online store. In the same way here, try to think about the potential of the company and its sector, on horizons of decades, not quarters.

# The sources

# The conclusion

The above should hopefully provide you with a good framework of how to assess opportunities, the approach to take and types of questions you should be asking.

This will be lengthy and confusing to begin with, but the more companies you look at and assess, the quicker and easier this whole approach will become.

There are angles I haven’t covered in here, such as how to size and time opportunities, in the bigger context of how to shape up your whole portfolio. That is a whole other set of which I will leave for another time.

While I'm fond of both companies and think both will prove to be extremely successful and huge EV players in the next 10 years, I think ya'll need to pay attention to Xpeng moreso than NIO.

Excluding fundamentals, Xpeng has shown consistently over the past three quarters faster and more significant growth quarter to quarter, and month over month than NIO. Those numbers are pretty non-negotiable because they're statistics, not opinion. NIO is still larger, but Xpeng is rapidly catching up.

Lots of the claims I see around this sub are in regards to NIO ""being the future of Chinese ev because of luxury subscription services, battery swap options, and future expansion into European markets""...can I ask what ya'll are smoking? Xpeng is ALREADY IN NORWAY. They entered Norway last during Q4 2020. Regarding battery swap...although it leads to faster charging solutions (because of lack of charge), it's not going to be sustainable and as faster actual charging solutions become available, this NIO service will become less of an advantage. For subscription services... Cmon guys. Ya'll know that these services were exactly the reason why NIO was on the brink of bankruptcy last year? It's a EV company! Not a luxury club. I really think people are overestimating that area as a future peer-advantage.

Xpeng doesn't have to worry about any of that. They don't swap batteries, they simply altered their models to utilize LFP (Lithium phosphate batteries) instead of Lithium Ion. Lower range but faster charging and... Let's be honest. Chinese EV clients are going to be living in cities. LFP batteries with 80% the range for cheaper aren't a deal breaker by any means. Subscription services don't exist because they aren't a smart idea for EV companies, and XPENG ALREADY ENTERED THE EUROPEAN MARKET IN Q4 2020. Guys, they're already better than NIO in this area, not even counting growth potential.

Xpeng devotes more money towards R&amp;D than any of its competitors, has better tech already, and is the first EV Company to be launching a mass-produced Lidar equipped EV ever. All of this isn't including they're autonomous system with rivals Tesla and definitely exceeds NIOs tech.

stocks,"One of the most anticipated IPOs of 2021 is labeled as a “children’s game”. Can Roblox live up to it’s recent hype? How does this kid’s game generate more than $1 billion in revenues over the last 12 months and grew it’s top-line revenues at over 100% from 2020 to 2021. The Weekly DD brings you a deep dive on Roblox (RBLX).

**Overview**

What exactly is Roblox (RBLX)? Roblox is an online entertainment platform where users interact with each other through something called a “metaverse”. The metaverse is a virtual space where real life and online worlds come together allowing users to engage in activities and experiences, and socialize with friends. There are two segments of users that create the ecosystem that is Roblox. The first are the content creators and developers, the second are the users/consumers who populate the metaverse and participate in said activities.

**Business Model**

Roblox relies on in-game micro-transactions to earn revenue. Users will buy items, both permanent and consumable, to enhance their accounts or the games they play. 30% of revenues are paid out to the developers of the games and the remaining goes to Roblox. For anyone doing their own analysis on Roblox I think it’s important to put a larger emphasis on “net bookings” vs “revenue” due to the way they recognize deferred vs captured revenue. Here’s a brief explanation from their investor presentation.

**Strengths**

Roblox’s strength and opportunities lie in the growth they have experienced over the last several years which saw some big tailwinds due to covid. There is still room for growth internationally and they have recently signed a deal with Tencent that will allow them to penetrate the Asian market (huge potential).

67% of their user-base is under the age of 16. Their users will eventually grow up from their teens into their twenties and capturing a more mature market will provide them with a great opportunity.

Lastly, they have the capability to not only be a gaming platform, but also dominate the virtual education scene. A transition into education would open new addressable market, which at the moment has been very limited.

**Risks**

As always, like any company there will be some risks associated to the stock performance. First, Roblox has been extremely hyped. From the IPO and ARK funds taking a stake, to Jim Cramer pumping, the company has seen good exposure and the stock price has greatly benefited.

On a more fundamental level, I thought it was interesting that a company that has been doing business for over 10 years did **not** scale that well coming off covid tailwinds. Revenue and net bookings have been growing at 140% and 160% YoY, respectively. However, their main expense buckets: cost of revenue, infrastructure costs, and development fees have been growing at almost the *same rate as revenues*.

**Final Thoughts**

Although I really like Roblox as a company, it is my opinion that the hype surrounding the name does not give a great entry point to the retail trader (at least currently). This company will be around for many more years and it will be interesting to watch how it develops. There may be better entry points down the road due to the high-volatility nature of this ticker in the post-IPO state. For a company that is still not profitable after 10 years of running and that didn’t scale as well as I thought while riding the coat tails of covid lockdowns, I will be sitting on the sidelines with my investment in this name. That doesn’t mean Roblox can’t eventually grow into their valuation. Roblox has many catalysts that I mentioned above and can possibly open a lucrative amount of addressable market for their taking.

stocks,"A green question, but I would like to hear it explained, as I am still in the beginner's course here.

At the depth of Pandemic, I opened my RH account (I know...) and bought $100 of FORD at avg price of  7.75.

MKT value now is 185, and 86% return. I'm in this as a money maker... So does ""take the profit"" dictate taking the $85 out, so that I'm left with only the original 100 invested? Even if I want to keep some stake, and perhaps grow my position. 

I know the simple answer is to follow my own interests. But I do not have any business training, and as I'm reading and learning a lot, now (like half-Kelly, etc.) I wonder if it does make more financial sense to withdraw profits, even if I plan to re-invest in shares at a higher price.

Robinhood clears the decks for its I.P.O.
Robinhood racked up another big fine yesterday, this time from the financial industry regulator known as FINRA. It’s the latest blow to the online brokerage, which has faced a series of accusations of misleading and marooning customers. But the company sees an upside to its latest legal run-in, too: It believes it has resolved lingering issues enough to move forward with its long-anticipated I.P.O.

FINRA hit Robinhood with a $70 million fine, the regulator’s largest ever, for a host of sins, including giving customers wrong information about trading on margin, failing to properly determine whether customers should have been approved to trade options and not properly shoring up its technical systems to avoid a series of outages between 2018 and 2020 that led to losses for customers.

That’s on top of previous fines, including a $65 million one by the S.E.C. in December for misleading customers.

And the hits may keep on coming. Lawmakers, who pummeled Robinhood’s C.E.O., Vlad Tenev, during a hearing in February, want tougher penalties: “Robinhood won’t clean up its act with slap-on-the-wrist settlements,” Senator Elizabeth Warren tweeted. “Our regulators need to show some backbone to hold Robinhood accountable.” The company still faces several pending suits and investigations:

Massachusetts’ top securities regulator sued Robinhood earlier this year, seeking to bar the company from operating in the state because of its aggressive marketing tactics.

The S.E.C. is still reviewing the company’s role in the January meme-stock rally.

Robinhood is a defendant in dozens of potential class action lawsuits from retail traders arising from trading restrictions during the meme-stock frenzy. The cases were consolidated into a single case in South Florida and divided into four parts, including “the Robinhood tranche.” Next month, the plaintiffs must file a single combined complaint for each of the four claims — and it could drag on for a long time.

But the, uh, good news for Robinhood is that it’s moving ahead with its I.P.O., with the brokerage set to publish its prospectus imminently, DealBook’s Michael de la Merced and Erin Griffith report for The Times. Settling the FINRA investigations appears to have been the final legal hurdle that the company wanted to clear before “flipping” its hitherto confidential I.P.O. document. (Keep your eyes peeled for the rundown of the company’s legal issues in the document, which could run to novella length.) If all goes to plan, expect Robinhood’s own shares to begin trading before the August doldrums.",Robinhood will go public within next quarter . How will it fare?,1625154777

stocks,"Background: I originally came across this stock studying it during a project for an International Business class, and learned about how Internationally Dominant the appliance brand is. 

Markets:

[https://www.whirlpoolcorp.com/global-locations/](https://www.whirlpoolcorp.com/global-locations/) 

HQ'd in Benton Harbor Michigan, North America: has 14 Headquarters for manufacturing/distribution in North America in US, Canada, Mexico. 

Europe, Middle East, Africa: 6 plants in Italy, 3 in Poland, 4 elsewhere in the region

Latin America: 1 plant in Guatemala, 11 in South America

Asia: 4 plants in India, 4 in China, 1 in Singapore 1 AUS plant

Whirlpool is one of the most internationally dominant companies I've ever researched. It's no wonder it came up in a case study of my international business class, and as a IB major, I believe that companies like these have a huge advantage. With massive supply chains, and integration into multiple markets, stocks like these are both flexible and capable of huge earnings growth, as their dominance in larger foreign markets allows them to slowly integrate into more specialized markets.

Their PE ratio reflects this as it is trading just over a ratio of 10, but earning around 17 in it's 5 year average. A ratio of 10 is generally reasonable regardless of industry, and it's also ahead of it's dividend yield average, currently yielding at 2.57% 

With this international diversity, risk of political barriers to earnings are lower when so much of its sales are driven by foreign markets. 

Their balance sheet is also balanced with the company having a current ratio of about 1, but no huge concerns with long term debt. The company is neither under nor overleveraged in my opinion, and still has time to take advantage of cheap fed interest rates in the US

There have been situations when I’ve been invested in a stock and have watched the bid/ask price closely only to be confounded by the ask price’s actions. There will be situations when the ask price will refuse to budge over the last price sale. Sometimes even staying below the last sale for quite some time.

In the situations in which the ask price stays at the last sale price, it will just stay there even while quite a few sales at that price are being done, until eventually of course when a last sale price is lower and closer to the bid price, at which time the ask price just simply drops.

I understand the ask/bid price is based off supply and demand, but logic says when demand is there at that current price, ask for a little more, I just don’t get it!!  This has happened to me on stocks that were allegedly being shorted, but I wasn't sure if that would play into it.

stocks,"It was evident that PSFE had finally found bottom last week.  For months, we saw all the tell-tale signs of market manipulators expertly shaking out retail shareholders with order flow, short volume, massive block trades and 13F’s showing institutions steadily loading up.  In this context, just as PSFE was to be officially added to the Russell 1000 and 3000 indexes, it seemed a little suspicious that Paysafe was suddenly being hyped and trending on WallStreetBets.  I had to wonder if this was an engineered event to generate more liquidity since market makers were clearly running out of sellers right when they had to fill a lot more institutional orders.

That’s all just monkey brain theory that ultimately doesn't matter because my plan is to hold PSFE for a long time.  There is a clear strategy with this company that will take some time to come to fruition and I want to be in on the ground floor, before all the rosy ER’s come in.  With a fintech that does roughly as much transactional volume as Square and, despite recent reports, has similar growth to PayPal, it’s no surprise that institutions want to accumulate at levels so low that the stock is almost completely de-risked from a long-term perspective.

The comprehensive DD below is for investors with a longer view who may have been caught in the recent hype. Know that you’re not alone. We saw the same thing right after CNBC’s Jim Cramer called Paysafe, “the ultimate stock for this moment” and market analyst Steve Grasso repeated his calls for it go to “$45/$50 and then settle in before moving higher from there.”  After initial spikes, deep-pocketed short-sellers methodically crushed retail holders, eventually bringing the price down to where it was last week.

But informed short sellers knew they couldn't push too far because that price was really not far from the price paid by noted fund managers like Dan Loeb (Third Point 41.5 million shares), David Tepper (Appaloosa Management, 10 million shares), Aaron Cohen (Survetta Capital, 13 million shares), Dipanjan Deb (Francisco Partners, 20 million shares) and Leon Cooperman (personally owns 1.1 million shares).  A price probably lower than paid by Wells Fargo’s several funds (12 million shares) and even by Blackstone when they raised their initial stake of 123 million shares to a total of 160 million shares.^(1)  Also, it’s worth noting that, since they all decided to invest, Paysafe has created significant value including securing new revenue streams in the US iGaming market and expanded partnerships with Coinbase, ESL Gaming, Luckbox, and Microsoft among others. ^(2)

With a presence in 120 countries, Paysafe is an extremely diversified global payment processor: #1 global leader in iGaming, #2 global digital wallet, #4 globally in integrated merchant processing. Ever since private equity groups Blackstone and CVC took Paysafe private, they’ve been going through a major restructuring to reduce risk, increase margins and profits. It's because they are still very much in the middle of that process that I like it so much as an investment opportunity. Here are a few key points:

&amp;#x200B;

* In 2017, private equity groups Blackstone and CVC raised their bid five times to ultimately to take Paysafe private for $3.9 billion.^(3)  Blackstone says their typical investment term is “upwards of 7-10 years” ^(4) which aligns with the investment time-frame implied by an inside source close to those negotiations who said, “There is a fundamental change in the way we pay for goods and services, away from the cash and cheques of our parents’ age,” adding that the private equity firms “have a decade-long thesis that this shift will only grow and grow and they want to get in now.” ^(5)
* Under Blackstone/CVC’s stewardship, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion (28% CAGR pre-Covid). Last year, due to Covid-related brick-and-mortar business and sporting event closures, along with their long-standing strategic decision to exit specific high-risk Asian revenue channels, 2020 revenue stagnated.  This is the reason they recently reported only 5% YoY quarterly growth.  In their Q1 ER, management noted that, without those channel exits they would have reported growth in the “mid to high teens.”  But even if you include 2020’s stagnant growth, their overall revenue growth since 2017 was still 18% CAGR. This is roughly the same as PayPal’s current projected growth. ^(6,7)
* A few months ago, Paysafe was brought public through a reverse merger transaction with acclaimed deal maker Bill Foley, Chairman of Fidelity. The deal paid down $1.2 billion in debt and gave Blackstone/CVC about $5.6 billion in cash and shares.^(8)  The fact that Blackstone's recent 13F shows they bought back 37 million shares, combined with statements from them and Paysafe's board, indicates that they did this deal, not for a mere 44% gain on a four year investment, but because Bill Foley is an extraordinarily successful and well-connected deal maker who has a proven track record for generating exponential growth.
* Inorganic growth through M&amp;A is a major pillar of Paysafe’s strategy going forward.  Bill Foley, now Chairman of Paysafe and a major shareholder, is a proven M&amp;A synergy wizard, particularly in the financial services arena.  Foley took Fidelity National Financial from $3 million market cap to $10.8 billion. Yeah, that’s and “m” and a “b”.  Over just the last five years, Foley grew Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun &amp; Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B).  Through his proven M&amp;A playbook, Foley also grew FIS from $2.5 billion to over $91 billion market cap. That’s a 36x return.  He says  “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” ^(6,9)

**Deleveraging, increasing margins and profit**

* Paysafe recently confirmed they are on track to meet 2021 projections of $1.53 billion in revenue, $930-$970 million in gross profit, double-digit growth and expanding 30-35% EBITDA margins, and $103 billion in transactional volume.  Paysafe’s already strong $362 million in 2020 free cash flow was reported to be on track for 29% growth in 2021.  Notably, their multi-year projections don’t include growth from their ""active M&amp;A pipeline"" and their ongoing US iGaming expansion (projected at 55% CAGR).
* Q1's earnings disappointed some because, as part of their restructuring, they had $90 million in one-time non-recurring expenses associated with the merger and paying down $1.2 billion in debt. The company noted: “Results included interest expense of $58.5 million, an increase of 53% compared to the prior year, reflecting the expense of capitalized debt fees as a result of debt repayment on March 31, 2021. Net loss also included share-based compensation of $72.4 million, compared to none in the prior year due to shares vested on completion of the Transaction.""
* Take away the $90 million in one-time expenses and, rather than reporting a $49 million loss, the company would have reported $41 million in quarterly net profit, thereby beating all analyst estimates. All signs indicate they are on track to beat estimates going forward, although I have noticed a few platforms raising those estimates recently.
* In addition to paying down $1.2 billion in debt, an improved Moody’s credit rating has enabled the company to refinance roughly a billion at a 1.25% lower interest rate, with an option to reduce it another 25bp.^(10)  Foley says: “One of the keys to this transaction and value creation for our shareholders is the reduction of Paysafe’s leverage ratio to 3.6x Debt/EBITDA.”  Notably, this Debt/EBITDA ratio is far better than the majority of their fintech peers, and the resulting improved margins stand to make it better still.
* The combined effect of overall recent debt management will be a savings of around $92 million annually.  This secures higher margins, increased cash for M&amp;A and higher profits which, in my view, will lead to raised price targets and positive price action catalysts.
* As part of their restructuring to cut down on operating expenses and further increase margins, Paysafe has recently forged agreements with Snowflake and AWS as they move to cloud-based integration for easier migration between their platforms, easier cross-border payments and planned expansion into global banking as a service, having identified a $58 trillion TAM.

**Highly competitve**

* Unlike other payment processors, Paysafecard enables those without basic ID metrics, credit cards, or even bank accounts (the 1.7 billion “unbanked” globally) to engage in eCommerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY.  Just today, Microsoft introduced Payesafecard to its Xbox platform in 22 countries.
* In various segments, Paysafe has recently expanded their partnerships with FOX bet, Roblox, Fortnight, Coinbase, Amazon, Twitch, Microsoft/Xbox, bet365, ApplePay, Draftkings, Spotify, Youtube, Visa, Betfair, PayLease, ESL Gaming, Luckbox, Amelco, BetMGM, Ceasar’s, and Pointsbet among many others.
* \#4 globally in integrated merchant processing, Paysafe’s proprietary scalable electronic payment platform was voted “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution”, “Payment Processor of the Year,” and “Best Payment Method.”
* They are #2 globally in the digital wallet space with a presence in 120 countries. They own Neteller and Skrill, which was voted “Best Digital Wallet” for “best consumer take up”, “most innovative technology” with “greatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.”
* People are usually more likely to leave reviews when a payment platform doesn’t meet their expectations. That said, Trustpilot rates Paysafecard as “Excellent” (4.7/5 stars-31,981 reviews), Paysafe’s digital wallet Skrill as “great” (4.1/5 stars-18,037 reviews) and Skrill Money Transfer as Excellent (4.8/5 stars - 8,349 reviews). ^(11)
   * By contrast, Truspilot rates Stripe as “Average 3.4/5 stars- 6,208 reviews), Venmo as “bad” (1.2/5 starts - 222 reveiews), Zelle as “bad” (1.2/5 stars - 326 reviews) and PayPal as ""bad"" (1.2/5 stars-18,555 reviews). ^(12)

&amp;#x200B;

**“At Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.”**

**“It’s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate.""** \- Bill Foley

&amp;#x200B;

* Paysafe is the #1 global leader in iGaming payment processing, a space that is extremely difficult to enter, due to managing risk and a very complex regulatory landscape. Paysafe’s advantage here is a large aspect of its MOAT, as discussed below.  Paysafe is often an integrated back-end payment processor so most don’t realize they are using it but they are already integrated with 75% of all US iGaming operators. Paysafe is actively laying the groundwork for their US expansion in the wake of a US Supreme Court decision allowing state-legalized sports betting.
* Bill Foley says, ""It’s going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else…we’re seeding the future growth right now by state and by operator... The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective... I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that’s headquartered or located in Las Vegas. There will be money to be made for everybody... We’ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It’s pretty exciting”
* In his letter to investors, fund manager Dan Loeb said, “We believe the US is poised to become the largest online gambling market globally as it begins to deregulate state by state and Paysafe is exceptionally positioned to capitalize as the global market leader.”
* Compass Point analyst Michael Del Grosso, who initiated coverage with a $19 price target, noted, “PSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States,” adding, “we believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.” ^(13)
   * Recent headlines since Del Grasso wrote that:
      * ""New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering""
      * ""Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature""
      * “New Hampshire sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly; Hogan likely to sign""

&amp;#x200B;

* Every analyst covering Paysafe rates it as a ""Buy"". A few quotes :
   * RBC Capital 5-star analyst Daniel Perlin: “We believe PSFE offers a unique combination of digital wallet capabilities, accelerated cash conversion for consumers who would otherwise be out of the ecommrece loop, and integrated payments, all focused on specialized &amp; complex end-markets, which creates a competitive moat and pricing power.” “recent underperformance is largely due to the complex nature of PSFE’s business and the FTAC II transaction” and adds his view that Paysafe offers one of the best combinations of services in online payment space: “PSFE has created a unique two-sided network enabling merchants to accept online &amp; in-store payments (in specific niche verticals), while also offering consumers a digital wallet &amp; eCash solution, which converts cash-heavy users to digital users. We believe it’s this combination that enables PSFE to generate superior take rate economics vs. peers.” ^(14)
   * BMO Capital, 5-star analyst, James Fotheringham: “PSFE is a global leader in iGaming (online betting related to sports, poker, and other casino games, as well as lotteries and bingo). Indeed, 36% of PSFE’s revenues are from global iGaming. That is far more than for any of its peers.” iGaming deposit volumes in the U.S. will grow “at more than five times the rate of growth elsewhere in the world” with a ""5-year CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of between 40% to 55%."" ^(15)
   * Evercore ISI analyst David Togut 'praised Paysafe for its “robust risk management operation,” and its high rankings in several key performance indictors globally, including cash network, stored digital wallet value, and amount of partnered independent merchants.' ^(16)

**MOAT:**  **“robust risk management operation”**

So why does Paysafe dominate iGaming and why how is it able offer eCommerce services to the 1.7 billion globally who can't even manage to have bank accounts or credit cards?

Their industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant or unwilling to enter. CEO Philip McHugh from transcript : “When we talk about a deep and a wide MOAT, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit where it’s hard to copy.…We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It’s a real strength of ours. We’ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we’ve upgraded the team, we’ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.”

“We can de-risk some transactions where the market has abandoned many of these players…we bring millions of consumers into the ecosystem. We bring unique ways to pay and access funds that a typical card processor certainly can’t do. When you have that two-sided network, you change the conversation. When we speak to some of our largest iGaming customers, we’re not only talking about take rates and comps, we’re talking about revenue-generation, we’re talking about attracting the types of customers that they want and they need in their ecosystem. That’s a really, really powerful position to have.” ^(9)

&amp;#x200B;

**Valuation:**

A while back I looked at a basket of fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign.

* Paysafe reports 30%+ EBITDA margin,  mid to high teen EBITDA growth, and $362 million in free cash flow (now on track to increase 29%),
* By comparison, a third of the peer group reported negative EBITDA, half reported negative EBITDA growth, and a third negative free cash flow.
* Paysafe also has better EPS than over half the group and better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them.
* The group's collective growth rate of \~12.5% is in the range of Paysafe's 10-13% projections but the company's estimates may be intentionally conservative as they do not take into account their current expansion into US iGaming nor do they factor in their ""active M&amp;A pipeline.""  Foley is apparently known for under-promising and over-performing.
* As noted above, Paysafe was growing 28% CAGR pre-Covid, but taking into account last years slow down due to Covid-related business closures and strategic channel exits, it grew at 18% CAGR, a rate on par with PayPal's projected growth.

Given all the above factors, it seems fair to look at Paysafe's potential price based on an average of peer multiples:

Paysafe’s share price with average of sector peer multiples:

* EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09
* EV/Rev ratio : $83.91

In a nutshell, the basket of sector peers has an average growth within Paysafe’s conservative projections yet they trade at 350-750% higher multiples. With Paysafe having better financials than most, it is hard to argue that this is proportionate. Either the entire field has to come down or Paysafe has to go up.  While I don't necessarily agree with his time frame, market analyst Steve Grasso's call for ""$45/55"" may actually be quite reasonable.

stocks,"Almost everyone considers P:E when buying stock in a company, but have you considered their [EV/EBITDA](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/072715/what-considered-healthy-evebitda.asp)? One is not necessarily better than the other, but It can be very helpful to consider a companies Enterprise Value.

 

If you were considering buying 2 cars, and they both cost $30k, but one had $2000 cash in the glove compartment, and the other had $2000 in unpaid parking tickets in the glove, that would be important to you, right? If you only look at market cap and not Enterprise Value (EV), you are ignoring what's in the glove compartment.

 

Consider 2 companies with a similar market cap, say INTC ($226.7B) and CSCO ($223.4B). If you just look at their market caps, you might say they are close enough (1.5% difference) that you will just directly compare their income statements. But Cisco has $29.4B in cash and only $14.5B in debt, so when you buy their stock, you are also buying some of their cash reserves. This is included in the Enterprise Value (EV) which is $223.4B+$14.5B-$29.4B=$208.5B

Intel has $23.9B cash and $36B debt, so their EV is $226.7B+$36B-$23.9B=$238.8B

So when you consider their cash and debt, Intel can be considered 14.5% more expensive than Cisco instead of 1.5%.

I took one stock per day, the one he pumped hardest, usually on mad money. I missed a couple of shows because I watch from the UK so can only get it online through some shitty VPN.

I ended up putting a minimum of £100 and a maximum of £345 into each stock.

Anyway, here's the results; I'll start with the one he recommended first, about 9 days ago, and build up to the most recent;

    Chewy - Up 6.8%
    American Express (he pushed this hard for 3 days) - Up 1.59%
    Facebook - Up 5%
    Ford - Up 1.17%
    Citibank - Up 4.68%
    TakeTwo - Up 3.48%
    Wells Fargo - Up 0.11%

He also pumped several others, which I didn't invest in. These are;

Clean Energy, down about 50 cents, but it's a meme stock so it's unpredictable.

Kinder Morgan - He pumped this about 2 weeks ago before I started my test, it's about evens.

Perkin Elmer - He pushed this for 2 days, its up about 7 dollars.

So yeah, Jimmy C. Might not be a bad follow after all. I know he can be a bit snakey, but in reality, if I was to dump my lifes savings into the stocks that he'd been offering advice on, I'd have a return of 22% in the space of a week.

I've noticed people beginning to think about the risk of an imminent crash lately on various finance and, uhh, stock-gambling subreddits. What stocks to buy in case there's a crash? Where is safe in a crash? That sort of thing. Take a look around, do some searches for 'crash' or 'bubble', you'll see it. A change in the mood. I track about 10+ finance forums every day, and I keep seeing it coming up every single day on daily threads and topic posts.

Of course, there are always people worrying about downside, the risks, and there are always people yelling the market is about to crash, perma-bears etc. ""Scared money don't make money"", and a stopped clock is right twice a day.  Why might this time be different? 

The backdrop
=====

The market is presently doing well following the idea of the 're-opening play' in addition to the free money fountain of central bank programs and government fiscal stimulus. However, I think the delta strain is going to prevent re-openings lasting more than a few weeks, and I think sentiment is going to turn sharply on that. 

Delta can often break past vaccines, unfortunately, and it spreads like absolute wildfire among the unvaccinated. Regardless, the EU and USA are opening up anyway! Given the R0 of 6 of delta, we should see very rapid spread when mask mandates, lockdown restrictions are removed, and people are socialising like crazy in the Summer of Hedonism. 

I would expect by end July to mid-August, delta will be causing very big problems pretty much everywhere in the world; it's established and spreading in 80+ countries already. Other strains are also a problem and we may see new variants of delta or entirely new strains showing up in the next 2-3 months. 

Do you think delta is the most deadly or infectious variant of covid we'll ever see? 

Consider: it's already about 2.5x faster spreading, more infectious in younger adults, more likely to cause symptomatic disease, new symptoms that can cause it to be misidentified, it has reduced the protectiveness of vaccines noticeably. If you look at the death/infections rate in covid-naive unvaccinated populations like Taiwan, it's potentially a lot more lethal too. That's how much covid 'improved' itself in the 12 months that constituted the bulk of its spread so far, and right now it's spreading (and getting lottery tickets to improve itself) in more people than ever. 

If it's not rapidly eliminated and has another 12 months to circulate, mutate, and continue getting stronger and work around vaccine antibodies, how bad might it become? Are state &amp; national governments in the EU &amp; US &amp; Japan etc taking actions that would eliminate covid before it gets any stronger, or taking actions that will likely allow it to continue to spread and develop?

The Bear Case
=====

My key argument: Central bank and government stimulus programs were timed and globally synchronised on the assumption of the re-opening play throughout this summer. Taxpayer funds and central bank willingness/effectiveness may be exhausted should this continue another year - or two. Does anyone think life around the world will be back to 'business as usual' by the end of summer? Or will it be still 'the end of the beginning' as delta begins to reach the people that alpha failed to reach? The liquidity trap for central banks is also a real concern as printing continues and rates stay close to zero, added to uncertainty about the security of income in many sectors. 

The number of doses of vaccine given worldwide is about 2 billion. The number of doses required to fully vaccinate the world just once is about 16 billion. Will covid continue to circulate and improve? What about new animal strains (remember the mink in Denmark?). What will happen to the stockmarkets and consumer demand in emerging markets with low levels of vaccination? 

Even if covid magically disappeared overnight in the developed world - and it won't - how can the US &amp; EU stockmarkets do well if most of the world is still being ruined by covid and new dangerous strains continue to emerge? 

Now consider: A CAPE10 PER of 38? - 38! good lord! (https://www.multpl.com/shiller-pe) - Government debts globally hitting dangerously high levels vs GDP in most developed countries? A struggling global supply chain? Stalled, chaotic re-opening plans? This re-opening can't afford to fail, but as delta arrives perfectly timed with summer re-openings and incomplete vaccination, how can it succeed? 

The world is already struggling where delta is well established this month.  https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/weekly-trends/#weekly_table . Some countries where delta is well established already: Russia, Indonesia, Bangladesh. Some countries with highly successful vaccination programs: United Kingdom, Israel, Seychelles. Sort by 'weekly case change' or 'weekly death change', ignore the small countries. Those are 'weekly' figures. Extrapolate out 6-8 weeks. 

For discussion: What do you think is going to happen here? How do you think governments will respond? How do you think the market will respond? 

Other examples
====

Consider: Taiwan, Australia, Vietnam, China, New Zealand, were successful in holding back covid for 15 months. But delta sneaked past all their defenses. Now they are engaged in various levels of restrictions to try and stop it. If they can't keep it under control, how are countries with low rates of vaccination and limited/nonexistent restrictions ever going to manage? 

And then we get into the economic costs of continuing to push hard on burned out healthcare systems, the economic costs of long covid, the economic costs of permanent damage to economies  (businesses that went bust and won't ever re-open - hospitality, tourism etc). A lot of businesses can survive a bad year. But it's been 18 months now struggling like this. How many of these businesses can survive 2, maybe 3 terrible years? How much of the economy can we afford to lose before we have a really serious crisis on our hands or permanent economic damage?

Too much like feb 2020
======

To me the whole situation today rhymes far too much with the sentiment and backdrop in February 2020. A deadly strain spreading. Market hitting new highs. Too many big countries not taking it seriously, Asia &amp; ANZ making a serious desperate attempt to stop it spiralling out of control.

The main difference with the February 2020 scenario? We're starting from a far, far, far higher point of stockmarket valuation (the SP500 is not just 'expensive', it's at the 2nd highest point of valuation ever, per CAPE10, and the highest ever in terms of broker margin, buffett ratio). 

The investor backdrop is bubbling hyper-bullish sentiment and outright gambling on most forums, manias and pump/dumps erupting multiple times a day, and bearly [!] an inkling of bearishness. Yet we're going forward from here with companies AND consumers AND governments AND central banks that have taken a balance-sheet beating for the last 15 months. We're looking at a far more deadly strain of disease that spreads faster, hits harder. We're looking at governments that have already burned out the political support and willingness-to-suffer of their populations.

This is not a recipe for success. This is a recipe for March 2020... on steroids. 

Some counter-arguments against my case
=========

&gt; ""The vaccines are effective and will bring covid to a halt"". 

By definition, disease with a natural R&gt;3 will continue to circulate even if vaccines are 66% effective against infection and 100% of the population is fully vaccinated. Contrast: The R of delta is around 6, the effectiveness of one of the best vaccines (AZN) is around 60%, and barely a handful of countries will have fully-vaccinated rates above 50% by the end of summer. 

&gt; ""Well, OK, vaccines won't stop it, but they will stop people dying of it. That's what matters. We don't lockdown for 20000 flu deaths/year.""

What we are seeing from delta is that AZN &amp; PFE/MDNA vaccines are **extremely** effective at preventing death generally, though less so in older people or immunocompromised people. I have read that a fully vaccinated 80 y/o has about the same chances vs covid as an unvaccinated 50 y/o, but I don't have the source to hand right now; sounds about right though. 

Vaccines aren't nearly so effective at stopping someone spreading covid to vulnerable members of their family. While vaccines have a wonderful effect in reducing hospitalisations too, delta hits hard and spreads fast, so hospitals are already beginning to get quite busy again as a result. The problem is that this means regular hospital operation is going to be affected. If you have a hospital full of ultra-hyper-contagious-but-not-deadly plague, you can't be doing regular surgeries etc. So people will unfortunately die from that, from delayed surgeries etc, specialities on hold to help out in the covid wards. Flu has an R around 1.5 and it slams the hospital system hard every year. An ongoing (and worsening into the end of the year) slamming of the hospital system with a mostly-non-lethal-but-still-needs-oxygen/vent disease, that spreads between wards with an R of 6, that is a different matter. There's also the issue that e.g. teachers, retail, dentists, doctors, hospital staff are simply exhausted and emotionally burned out from dealing with this. The systems are under a huge amount of pressure as it is even today. It isn't realistic to expect governments to keep saying 'tough shit', all the public 'ignoring' covid all around, while these sectors crumble under the pressure.   

&gt; ""Regardless of whether it spreads, or whether people are dying, no matter how bad it gets, governments will simply not lock down again. End of story.""

We saw in Sweden last year that if governments fail to enact a lockdown, a large part of the public will do it themselves anyway. And many businesses cannot operate at full productivity if workers keep falling ill and ending up long-term sick or in hospital, even if those workers remain alive. Many businesses cannot profitably operate on 30-50% custom. Ultimately, democratic governments cannot force you to go out and get slammed by a deadly plague providing you have enough money in the bank to avoid it. The retail &amp; hospitality economy will not prosper if the only people out shopping/eating/holidaying are those unable to afford the luxury of hiding at home from a massive covid outbreak.

Random things

Remember, whether it's 1987 or 2020, you don't get a warning before the rug gets pulled from under your feet. A trip down memory lane. https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ES4uVEcXsAEqZkT?format=jpg&amp;name=4096x4096 . https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51829852 . Not that long ago, really?

Also - ""Be Fearful When Others Are Greedy"", the sage wrote. But what does **greedy** look like? Does it look like 'my stock is worth $1m/share'? No. **Greedy** looks like this: smart, sensible, sane people saying things like 'well OK, sure this market seems pretty weird, idiots being stupid, but the music's still playing, and I think there's still time to skim a quick 5-10% and get out before it all falls apart. There will be a bit of warning before shit hits the fan; I'll run for the exit when I see it'. 

The steamroller has arrived, it is right there, towering over them, but still their eyes are on the pennies on the ground, even though they know they ought to know better. But it hasn't started squishing ... yet. Then the moment arrives, and the door for everyone to get out is...  so very narrow. Painfully mixed metaphors but you see my point. 

Finally

Disclosure; I am now completely out of the market.

Some further material for thought:  https://www.gmo.com/europe/research-library/waiting-for-the-last-dance/

A closing note: every day, the next major stockmarket crash always gets one day closer. It's like the theta decay on a long-dated option whose expiry date is a secret. Hardly there at all for months or years, the signal lost in the noise, then suddenly, it arrives, it's the day, and everything is gone at once. 

Stay safe everyone, get your vaccines, and don't catch the plague. The zero-th rule of making money is: be alive to enjoy it.

p.s. If you think what I've written is wrong/stupid fair enough but  don't downvote this purely because you are currently long in the market and don't like seeing bearish sentiment.

Popular investing platform Robinhood has agreed to pay nearly $70 million to the financial industry regulatory authority (FINRA) to settle allegations that the brokerage caused customers “widespread and significant” harm on multiple different fronts over the past few years. That is the largest financial penalty ever ordered by the organization, a non-government entity authorized by Congress to oversee hundreds of thousands of brokers across the U.S. Specifically, FINRA’s investigation found that millions of customers received false or misleading information from Robinhood on a variety of issues, including how much money customers had in their accounts, whether they could place trades on margin and more.

The inaccurate information cost customers more than $7 million, FINRA found, and Robinhood is required to pay restitution to affected users. Other allegations addressed in the settlement include that Robinhood approved risky options trades for thousands of users when it should not have and did not do enough to prevent system outages in March 2020 that adversely affected millions of users. Robinhood has invested in improving the platform and is building out its customer service team, Robinhood spokesperson Jacqueline Ortiz Ramsay writes to CNBC Make It in an emailed statement about the settlement.

“We are glad to put this matter behind us and look forward to continuing to focus on our customers and democratizing finance for all,” she says. Robinhood was launched in 2014 and attracted millions of customers, many of them first-time investors, with its easy-to-use app and industry-changing commission-free trades. But it has come under fire multiple times in the past few years, most recently during the GameStop rally earlier this year when it restricted trading. FINRA’s investigation found that Robinhood’s customer service issues go back much further. Between 2018 and 2020, for example, Robinhood failed to report tens of thousands of customer complaints to FINRA that it was required to report, the organization says.

FINRA also alleges that Robinhood has “negligently communicated false and misleading information” at different times since September 2016. Those misleading and false statements had hurt customers financially, FINRA found. The report also referenced the tragic story of a customer with details matching that of 20-year-old Alex Kearns, an investor who died by suicide in June 2020 after Robinhood showed a negative cash balance of $720,000 in his account. FINRA found that his balance was inaccurate, and that the value of his position was half of what the account displayed. While Robinhood has offered options trading since December 2017, FINRA says it has “failed to exercise due diligence before approving customers to place options trades,” relying on algorithms, rather than people, to approve customers for the risky investing move.

“As a result, Robinhood approved thousands of customers for options trading who either did not satisfy the firm’s eligibility criteria or whose accounts contained red flags indicating that options trading may not have been appropriate for them,” FINRA writes.

Finally, the company failed to supervise the technology it uses to provide its core services between January 2018 and February 2021, resulting in a series of outages and systems failures. One of these outages occurred on March 2 and March 3, 2020, during extreme market volatility. FINRA says these outages cost certain individual customers tens of thousands of dollars. Robinhood did not admit nor deny the charges, and it still under investigation by the SEC. On Wednesday, the company published a blog post to highlight the changes it has implemented to address customer concerns.",Robinhood to pay $70 million fine after causing ‘widespread and significant harm’ to customers,1625111048

TL;DR tickers: TSLA, ARKX, ROKT, UFO, INTEQ, IRDM, ASTS

We can’t invest in Starlink, and I wish we could. I’m looking for stocks &amp; ETFs to benefit from Starlink and Starship. I am holding $TSLA IPO, and that’s good stuff.

First the ETFs. $ARKX. Kind of some out of the box choices, but it is clearly built around Starship being a big deal in coming years. Space will be much cheaper. I also have $ROKT &amp; $UFO. Those aren’t geared around Starlink, but I want to own space stocks.

$GOGO. They sold their commercial aviation division to Iridium ($INTEQ.) The bankruptcy court approved INTEQ buying the division. I bought some INTEQ on the cheap, even though I know better than to buy a stock while in bankruptcy. (INTEQ is a huge government and military space server provider with lots of assets in orbit, btw.) Anyway, GOGO now only services private jets.  With no space assets and a dominant position for cell data, they could greatly benefit from Starlink.

While looking for Starlink plays, I found some stocks that seem to be outside of the reach of Starlink.

$IRDM. Iridium does old school sat phones. Pretty amazing for data emergencies if you are at sea or hiking on a mountain. These are places Starlink cannot cover well.

$ASTS. These cats are trying to send normal cell signals from satellites. Best I can tell, the tech looks legit. If it works, it will be very valuable. In fact, it will kill $IRDM, probably. I do not know if it will work, so this is a gamble. Worth the gamble, I think.

# Risks

The company is witnessing inflation related to raw materials. During January and February 2021, commodity costs grew to its all-time high. The company is encountering supply-related challenges with respect to some of the products including OSB, plywood, lumber and particleboard, thereby leading to the price hike.

Although the demand for single-family residential housing remained very high, the company faced troubles meeting those demands due to labour and material-availability constraints.

stocks,"This works particularly well for penny stocks which are more prone to rapid sentiment changes and price swings.

I found a trend. I tested it out. It actually worked out well for me several times now. But it’s a really difficult strategy to execute.

My theory was that you can identify a good entry point in a stock based on a negative change in online sentiment which is NOT correlated to company news and updates or market performance etc.

I believed that if the online sentiment changed to a negative one overall without there being an underlying reason, that it was a good sign that people shorting the stock were anxious to keep the price down and others were bashing it online to get a better entry point.

My theory is that the bashing behaviour doesn’t occur at random. It occurs strategically.

If people know the share price is going to go up in the mid term and want to keep it quiet to get a better entry point there are going to be some people who attack the stock online to try to bring the price down to give themselves more time for a lower buy in point.

If people have been shorting a stock and need time to exit their positions as they are anticipating a rise in share price they will be inclined to do the same as well.

So, in a way, online stock bashing could be seen as an inverse indicator of the current overall expectations of the actual future share price.

Here’s how the strategy works. Use websites that provide indicators of stock sentiment on social media. Pick out companies which have recently had strong negative sentiment. Figure out if there is a valid reason for the change in sentiment based on publicly available information about the company.

If nothing has changed in the companys underlying performance and they were in an uptrend before the negative sentiment began, begin to investigate the nature of the online sentiment.

Go on Reddit, Stocktwits or Twitter and actually read through all the comments you can find. Check to see whether or not the negative comments are baseless.

If the sentiment of the stock online is negative for a good reason, such as anticipating a logical negative outcome, then stay away.

If the comments bashing the stock are baseless and can’t be backed up by logic, fact or reasonable predictions then you probably have a winner.

Unfortunately this strategy can be stressful. You have to read a lot of negativity. You have to think critically and have extensive knowledge of how the market and businesses work. You have to be able to discern bullshit and emotional statements from logic. You have to be able to tell the difference between genuine criticism of a company’s performance and false criticism which can sound logical but often skews the facts to try to generate a negative view of the company. But those types of statements won’t stand up to solid research on the company.

If a stock is being heavily attacked online using flawed logic and emotional statements and there are no red flags about the company other than a recent change in share price caused by the above bashing and trolling behaviours then you probably have a good buy in point as the stock will now have an unfair lower price point caused exclusively by bashers.

If you strongly believe this is the case and there is no discernible grey area after solid investigation, just buy the stock. Ignore websites that give price targets as those are always generated based on existing numbers including the dips caused by bashing.

You have to be willing to hold until the bashing behaviour subsides or until the company’s performance proves them wrong. Once it does and investor sentiment returns to the norm you will gain by the artificial price suppression being lifted. In addition, companies being bashed like this usually have something going for them so you can capitalize on their progress at the same time.

I guess you could say this strategy basically takes advantage of trolls and bashers and uses the price suppression resulting from their online behaviour as leverage to amplify your gains.",Making money by inverting negative sentiment created by stock bashing and trolling,1625085687
stocks,"Add the funding from the “infrastructure” bill and the buses should start rolling!

Electric school buses may be the next wave of EVs to hit the commercial market, one executive within the industry says.
Patrick Gervais, Lion Electric (LEV) VP of marketing and communication, discussed the progress made with electric vehicles on a Yahoo Finance Live segment Tuesday afternoon.
“I think there’s a really good intention to electrify 100% of school buses within the next couple of years,” Gervais said. “We could feel the hype all across the United States. I mean, we’ve delivered buses in New York, in Minnesota, all across the country.”
The infrastructure bill, which is supported by President Biden, is expected to provide an additional $15 billion to electric vehicles infrastructure. Under the framework of the bill,  $7.5 billion is to be allocated to schools and public transit organizations to help convert to electric buses.
Gervais noted that a transition to electric school buses would have a plethora of benefits besides a reduction in carbon emissions. “There’s no noise pollution, so it’s more quiet and the kids are more calm and more concentrated when they go to school,” he said. “These are the kids and the people of tomorrow [who] will drive electric cars in the future.”
Currently, less than 1% of school buses are electric. Over 400,000 school buses drive over 3.5 billion miles each year, according to a Bellwether Education Partners study. The transition to electric buses will take initiative, but with the right moves, Gervais said, the entirety of the US school bus fleet could be electrified in 10-15 years.
Abroad, electric vehicles have sparked the interest of consumers of late — 11% of the 11.6 million new cars registered in the EU, Iceland, Norway and Britain last year were either fully electric or plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. Meanwhile, EVs and plug-ins accounted for less than 3% of new car sales in the United States.

stocks,"**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, June 30, 2021**

*Please Note: Apologies for not sending the Daily Recap out yesterday, I was having technical issues on my end. Thankfully, all the issues were resolved, it's full steam ahead.*

Stocks traded mixed today, with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) rising while the Nasdaq (QQQ) fell modestly after hitting record highs for many consecutives days. In short, stocks continue to hover near record highs. Market participants are encouraged a stronger-than-expected gain on private payrolls and tempered inflationary fears. Looking ahead, market participants wait for Q2 earnings season and incoming economic data. 

Today, ADP’s June private payroll report showed private payrolls increased faster than expected[.](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/adp-june-private-payrolls-jobs-market-pandemic-economy-recovery-121542029.html) This underscores the ongoing economic recovery with the US economy reporting its sixth straight monthly increase in employment. Job openings rose by 692,000 versus the 600,000 expected. Consumer confidence has also risen and pointed to Americans' increased propensity to spend, with the Conference Board's consumer confidence index racing to its highest level since February 2020. 

David Lefkowitz, UBS Global Wealth Management Head of Equities, said “If you look at what's really been powering the economy and powering the stock market, it's been the fact that there's been so much fiscal stimulus poured into the economy. What's really crucial though is that a lot of that fiscal stimulus has actually not been spent this year. It's sitting on the balance sheets of consumers."" I totally agree. Consumer spending accounts for roughly 70% of US GDP. Now that the economy is reopening thanks to effective distribution of the vaccine, I expect saving-laden consumers to step out and spend big this summer after enduring social distancing guidelines for more than a year. 

Today marks the last trading session of the second quarter of the year, so I thought it would be useful to take a look back at the performance of different assets since March. Year-to-date through Tuesday's close, the S&amp;P 500 has increased 14.3%, the Nasdaq by 12.7% and the Dow by 12%. The 10-year Treasury yield hit a year-to-date peak of 1.77% in March but is on track to end the quarter yielding just under 1.5%. The West Texas intermediate crude oil rebounded by 23% as demand for energy picks up. Digital currencies, on the other hand, had a very difficult quarter, with prices sharply down across the board compared to the beginning of the quarter. 

**Highlights**

* Pending home sales were up 8% in May month-on-month, helping reverse April's 4.4% drop, according to data from the National Association of Realtors. This brought the pending home sales index to 114.7, or the highest reading for the month of May since 2005. 
* Chinese ride-hailing giant Didi (DIDI) began trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The company sold 316.8 million shares to raise $4.4 billion, making it one of the largest initial public offerings of a Chinese company in the U.S. since Alibaba's (BABA) $25 billion listing in 2014. Trading began trading at $18, roughly 29% higher than its $14 IPO price, though throughout the session the stock lost most of its IPO gains. 
* General Mills (GIS) said it is raising prices across nearly all its grocery categories by around 7% due to higher costs for ingredients and labor. 
* Ford Motor (F) said it will be forced to cut output across more than a half-dozen U.S. factories in July due to continued pressure from the global shortage in semiconductors.
* PayPal (PYPL) is intensifying competition with Square (SQ) by launching its own physical card reader to put in stores. While both are undisputed leaders in fin-tech, PYPL has always focused more intensely on peer-to-peer transactions while SQ put more of an emphasis on consumer-to-business transactions.
* Twitter Inc on Tuesday named Sarah Personette as chief customer officer to oversee the social media platform's global ad sales, global content partnerships and revenue operations. The company has been making a big push to increase revenue lately.

stocks,"I've always suspected that one of the most costly mistakes I've made when investing has been selling prematurely, but I never dug through my data to determine if that was actually true.  So I decided to do that.  I went back over 21 separate decisions I've made to sell stocks over the past 12-18 months to see what happened in the months after the sales.

None of these were short-term trades, they were all intended to be long-term investments when I bought them but ended up deciding to sell.  Sometimes it was based on technical signals (new downtrends, violation of the 50 day moving average, price running up too fast and getting over-extended beyond the 50 DMA) but other times it was based on concerns about valuation.  Sometimes it was pure impatience, getting frustrated with a stock going nowhere and wanting to find a better opportunity.

Out of the 21 sell decisions, 18 of them turned out to be wrong in the sense that the price ended up higher than my sell price within the ensuing weeks and months.  In only 3 of the 21 cases did the decision to sell turn out to be a good one.  But the important thing is what I can learn from this to improve my decisions in the future.  Here are some observations:

1) A break below the 50 day moving average is a very unreliable sell signal, especially if the stock remains in a longer term uptrend.  Price dropping below the 50 DMA theoretically signals a change in the medium term trend, which could foretell the beginning of a longer term downtrend.  But in almost every case where I sold after the stock dropped below the 50 DMA, it reversed course within days and continued up.  The only case where this turned out to be a good signal was when the stock traded below the 50 DMA for several weeks.

2) Don't sell stocks based on concern about valuation.  Valuing stocks isn't an exact science; I'm not a professional and even professionals can have very different opinions about the fair value of a stock.  In every single case where I sold because I thought the stock got ""overvalued,"" it continued climbing.  This is where some of my biggest mistakes happened in terms of lost profits.  For example, I sold APPS last October for a 6x return at $32 only to watch it hit $100 within 5 months.

3) Selling when the stock dropped was always a mistake.  This overlaps with (1) because the drops typically coincided with a technical signal (breaking below the 50 DMA or breaking a support level), but every time that happened the stock reversed course soon after.  Unless the selloff reflects an underlying change in the long-term prospects for the business, you should be taking advantage of drops to buy not sell.

To be fair to myself, some of these decisions could have turned out to be correct if I moved the money elsewhere and saw better returns than if I had left the money where it was.  But the results clearly show that premature selling is a costly mistake.","21 decisions to sell, got almost all of them wrong",1625077690

The race between Branson and Bezos has been publicized and recently there is speculation that Branson is quietly looking to edge out Branson for the first to fly. 

Albeit that Branson’s attempt to fly first seemed highly speculative at the first announcement of Bezos flying it now seems like a fair expectation as there have been numerous well publicized articles declaring Branson’s secret ambition. According to SEC regulations that would require denial or clarification on part of SPCE, whom has not declared it false and ambiguously announced a flight without a passenger list. 

Aside from the ambiguity on part of SPCE it has several well timed catalysts that have come to fruition over the last couple months. This is speculation yes, however, it is becoming tangible in numerous ways.

I currently own 8,000 PAVMZ warrants in my traditional IRA purchased at $0.75 each. Each warrant allows me to purchase one share of PAVM at a price of $1.60; the warrants expire in 2024. From what I can tell, there is no cashless exercise provision.

While I’m currently enjoying the fact that my warrant purchase has provided me with a 535% return (as of today), I’m trying to work out my strategy when the warrants are either called by the company or when 2024 arrives, whichever comes first. I am bullish on PAVM. 

Let’s assume that PAVM goes to $10 a share, and PAVMZ reaches $8.40 at the same time. The way I see it, I can either a) pay the $12,800 to exercise the warrants and ride with 8,000 shares of PAVM stock at $1.60, or b) sell the warrants for $67,200 and buy 6,720 shares of PAVM. 

Questions:

- Are these my only two options? Am I overlooking other options?

Been reading recently of how many Redditers are advocating for another pullback/recession given the amount of money sloshing around the economy or the various deadly Covid variations making the rounds of other countries or some combination of both. Some Redditers, even though rather aggressive have a lot of good points.  Not saying they are wrong, but it would seem time to take prudent steps to get your portfolio in order and shake loose some money.

Unfortunately all of them seem to be firmly glued to extremes - either sell everything now and sit on cash or keep money in the market until the very last second and then pull it all out of the market in the nick of time (never worked for me). I am working a different angle that is a longer game.

What both approaches above share is buy once then forget until panicked selling. Admittedly it uses less time lurching into buying and then lunging into selling than my method. 

I buy dividend stocks so that I can watch my money grow with or without a recession. Not saying never participated in the occasional rocket:  jail stock, health stock or  gaming stock. Just went in for a quick profit on the meme's and was out. Quick &amp; clean. But the dividend stocks are treated differently.

After doing DD, I closely monitor these stocks for their price movement after I buy them. When I initially buy it is a small amount - \~ 40% of what I ultimately want to own. I keep this as a core position then trade in the stock - buying when it has a pull back and selling when the trading position goes higher. My ultimate goal is to own these dividend stocks at a average cost of less than $3-$5/share in less than 3 years.

Using this method, I own a good handful of stocks at less than $3/share which makes just about any crash meaningless to these stocks in my portfolio. So far have used this method on ¼ of the  stocks in portfolio. Stocks have done this to include: 

AES - avg. cost $3.57 \[did have a cost basis of zero, then a buying opp occurred\] - Currently selling for $26.25

CVA - avg. cost $.46 \[ yeah that is correct 46 cents\] Currently selling for $17.47.

CC - avg cost $8.75 \[still working on this one\] Currently selling for $34.64.

CWEN - avg cost $10.46 \[still working on this one\] Currently selling for $26.67.

HEES - avg. cost $13.20 \[still working on this one\] Currently selling for $33.24.

HASI - avg. cost $.74 Currently selling for $56.73.

HTGC - avg. cost $6.33 \[still working on this one\] Currently selling for $17.01

IIPR - avg cost $24.62 \[afraid that is about as good as this will get\] Currently selling for $193.55.

RF - avg cost $1.21 Currently selling for $20.08.

SPTN - avg. cost $.124 Currently selling for $18.79

SKT - $7.57 \[ still working on this one. Bought stock 4 months before became a momentary meme stock. Thanks Redditers for making this a meme stock one time\] Currently selling for $18.79.

The bulk of my portfolio are made up of stocks like MAIN, FE, ET, ETRN, IRM, etc that were bought at decent to good prices and am looking for a correction/recession to add to them. With the stocks I have gotten down in price recently - CVA, CC, RF, SPTN I have a pretty good head start on cash that has been freed up to indulge the other dividend stocks I own and get their cost down.

There is just something, to me, about having a stock that has a YOC of 190% (HASI) \[$.74 (stock price)/by $1.40 (yearly dividend)\] that makes me smile at night when I go to sleep.",Looking to a pullback &amp; beyond,1625066132

I was just scrolling the sub and noticed a handful of people talking shit on technical analysis, it doesn’t work, it has never been proven to work, etc..

I want all you TA bashers to know that you don’t know what you’re talking about. 

There are some aspects of TA that I deem utterly useless like “head and shoulders” or “cup and handle”. 

As far as the basics go, like channel trading, support and resistances, rsi indicator, these things are incredibly accurate if you have a solid game plan of entries, exits, and stop losses.

I have a watchlist of about 150 stocks that I believe are fundamentally solid that I have been trading in and out of for years. Made almost 400% last year and i’m up over 100% this year even though my trading has drastically slowed.

Crowdstrike stands in a league of it's own.  That's why they are valued at like $58 billion.  They use a threatgraph of all their clients endpoints meta data, storing only meta data (like, this person opened a word document), and have the second largest data footprint on AWS (Netflix is #1...with movies...and insanely huge ops).

SentinelOne has a similar approach.  The platform is slick, has a nice Ui, and is created by israeli cybersecurity experts.  It has less data to work with to correlate attacks, but still has amazing potential as they have huge clients (think, one used to be the biggest company in the world...). It works on LINUX (servers!) which is a huge advantage, because CrowdStrike does not.  However, they don't use in-person threat hunting (or it is not quite as developed) they use Ai threat-hunting (most deem inferior, but still amazing and comparable efficacy).

100+% revenue growth YOY, $135Mish revenue.  Coming out valued at approx $8B, vs CS's $58B.

one of maybe 3 total solutions that are truly effective against ransomware on endpoints at the highest level (think, S1, crowdstrike, and carbon black).

it's cheaper than crowdstrike, and crowdstrike is expensive, but a more hollistic platform.  S1 will be for companies that want to save some money but still get top tier endpoint protection, and will eventually compete head to head as the sole challenger.  Also some clients like the ability to have endpoint protection for servers running on linux, not sure if crowdstrike has that yet. Think, Mercedes vs BMW.  

My personal price target (maybe 40-50 per share) before I think it's over valued is $25B mkt cap, so I think this is a decent 2x play over the next year, possibly more if Biden admin invests more and more in cybersecurity, since S1 and CS are the two best solutions, and both are used by govt. already.",Sentinel One - This will go HAM,1625030608

stocks,"I’ve seen a ton of posts about trading SOFI and short squeezes etc. but I’m investing in SoFi for the LONG TERM and here’s why:

1. SoFi actually had positive EBITDA in Q1 and is forecasting $27M in EBITDA for 2021! How many high growth, recent IPO’s can say that!  SoFi is forecasting $254M EBITDA in ’22, $484M ’23 ($1.17B in ’25 but that’s a bit of a wild card since it’s so far in the future…).  That’s a 162% CAGR over 3 years and 113% CAGR over 5.  They exceeded guidance in Q4’20 and in Q1’21 !!!  Their forecast is also somewhat conservative since it excludes the impact of the pending bank charter acquisition which could increase these #’s.  It also excludes some of the new offerings that were just announced like Auto Loans and IPO investing (underwriting).  
2. Rapid revenue and customer growth! Forecast of $980M in 2021 to $2.1B in 2023 is a 29% CAGR over 3 years (28% CAGR over 5 years).  2.28M unique customers in Q1 and targeting 3M customers by the end of 2021.  They have a great track record of upselling existing customers (very low cost to upsell vs. acquire) with about 1/4 of their customers using multiple products, this should only improve as they add more product lines (like auto loans…and hopefully options soon!)
3. Galileo technology platform actually turns a major cost center into a profit center and makes them a true Fintech vs. just an online bank like Ally etc.  Galileo is expected to grow 55% CAGR from 2020-2025 with an estimated 62% margin.  This gives them a great B2B model and de-risks a 100% banking model.  Galileo is the Fintech engine behind 70M accounts (Q1 #’s) and customers include Robinhood, Chime, Monzo, Revolt etc. Galileo’s APIs power functionalities including account set-up, funding, direct deposit, ACH transfer, IVR, early paycheck direct deposit, bill pay, transaction notifications, check balance, and point of sale authorization as well as dozens of other capabilities. 
4. Future bank charter with the pending acquisition of Golden Pacific Bancorp will help juice profitability and revenue growth and lowers their cost of capital.  This is expected to grow profits from $484M in 2023 to $718M in 2023.  If their estimates are correct AND the acquisition goes through that would increase the 3-year earnings CAGR from 162% up to 198%!  This deal should close by the end of 2021
5. Solid leadership:  Anthony Noto, CEO has a strong background in Finance with Goldman Sachs and the NFL (CFO) AND Technology from Twitter (COO).  Chris Lapointe, CFO also has a great mix of Tech (Uber) and finance from Goldman Sachs.  Similar story with the rest of the executive team.  Strong marketing with SoFi stadium in LA (Superbowl venue) and SoFi’s investment team is frequently on CNBC (Liz Young etc.)
6. Rising interest rates is actually POSITIVE for SoFi!  Banks pay customers a relatively low interest rate on short term deposits and charge customers a higher interest rate on longer term loans.  As rates rise their margins increase.  With rates at record lows, a rapidly recovering economy and inflation on the horizon rates should only go higher (maybe substantially and much faster than normal).  The bank charter only enhances this….
7. I invested a little in SoFi (via IPOE) originally after it pulled back and wanted to invest more BUT before I did, I opened accounts at SoFi to verify that it’s all that they say it is.  So I opened a checking account, 2% cash back credit card, active investing account, automated investing account.  This is the real deal:  Products are SUPER competitive (2% cash back on a CC with NO annual fee!), Checking account pays 0.25% with no fees, $0 stock trades for active investing and direct access to IPOs (I participated in their 1st 4 IPOs today - 6/29) and no cost automated advisor investing.  They really treat you like a “member” and customer service has been great so far.  The mobile App is very user friendly with a ton of added features (credit score, education etc.).  
   1. If you own SoFi stock for the long term and you’re not a customer yet – you’re doing yourself a disservice.  You are an owner in the company and you should be profiting from your own banking!  Try them – you’ll love them and start consolidating all your accounts to them like I am.

Volume should dissipate and the stock held its ground even with 50M shares trading a day (10X normal volume). There is a ton of demand for not only high growth but also PROFITABLE companies and FinTech specifically.   Based on their market cap and projections for profitability they should be added to the Russell indexes next year and possibly the S&amp;P Indexes if they can meet the profitability criteria etc. 

Analyst Price Targets:

Oppenheimer:  Overweight $30 Price Target

Rosenblatt = BUY $25 Price Target

I personally don’t follow Analysts too closely but it does drive institutional investor buying and helps give you a sanity check. 

Based on the multiples of other FinTechs my price target is $50 in 3 years assuming they hit their guidance.  

There are obvious risks if multiples come down or if they miss their targets and there is a very high short interest right now but so far they have delivered on all their guidance and growth.  

I’ve seen a ton of posts on SoFi trading with a lot of hopes and dreams of a quick hit or WSB pushing it higher and that’s not why I put my money into SoFi over the past few months.  I’m an investor not a gambler...but I have been buying some of the dips when it does on sale.

Disclosure:  I’m long SoFI and it’s my largest holding.  I continue to buy more on dips and plan to add more in general as they meet their targets and goals, release new products.

stocks,"Sorry this is a bit long winded, but I wanted to put out my entire investment case for silver, maybe just to feel better about having invested most of my life savings into it. I own silver mining stocks, ETF's, and options, but this is the case that ties them together. This is just my opinion. Do you own research, since I’m not qualified or interested in, giving investment advice.

**Supply**

First, it’s important to consider that silver is not like other commodities. It sounds kind of silly, but if we were talking about wheat, oil or pork bellies, the supply and demand would have to match, in the long term and the short term. Gold and silver are mostly valued based on existing stockpiles. They have been mined for thousands of years, and for most of that time, excluding the last 150 or so years, almost everything ever mined was still in some sort of usable form. This is why these metals can act differently than almost other commodities. If the price of corn spiked higher, farmers would switch crops to farm more, and it would eventually correct the price to the cost of production and a reasonable profit margin. Gold or silver could go for a long time being too expensive or too cheap, and it wouldn't immediately correct itself, since the price is based more on the huge stack already mined, rather than just what's going to be mined in the next year. This one frame shift is really key to understanding the current state of the market.

Silver is primarily mined as a byproduct of Copper Lead, Zinc, and Gold mines. This may seem like a random interesting fact, but it actually effects the market a whole lot. If we were talking about lithium instead of silver, and the lithium price went up 5x, every lithium mine in the world will go into overdrive, try to expand production as fast as possible, build any new mines they could, and that will eventually reverse or slow the price increase. If you have a mine that produces 90% of their revenue from lead and zinc, they aren't likely to do the same expansion if the 10% of production that’s silver goes up 5x.

I’ve heard some people talk about the market size of silver as being $1.5T. That's the rough value of all silver ever mined in 3000 years, and is pretty irrelevant in this context. The amount of silver in investible bar form is under 3B oz, which is less than $80B. The Comex has about 110M oz, in registered inventory, and 244M oz in eligible inventory. Eligible inventory is inventory that could be put up for sale if the owners wanted, so it might not be for sale at any given price. The LBMA has 1B oz, but around 85% is already owned by ETF’s. There is lot of silver in the world, but very little for sale in an investment grade, at anywhere near current prices. For a market apparently worth $1.5T, it seems like you could buy every bar in available in the world for about $7B. That’s obviously not counting the existing demand, so it might not take a huge amount of new demand to move this market significantly.

Never forget that every oz of silver in the world is already owned by someone. When people talk about “new” supply coming on the market, that has to be someone who wasn’t willing to sell at the old price but is willing to sell at the new price.

Although there has been much more silver mined through history, silver inventories have been chipped away for decades by industrial consumption, while gold inventories have grown. Don’t forget that although gold has grown, so has the human population, and especially the population those with enough wealth to own gold or silver.

The whole mining industry has been slumping for a very long time. Discoveries of new significant deposits are not only down, but new additions to PM reserves fail to add as many oz as are produced each year. If you consider that it takes years between exploring, drilling, permitting, more drilling, and construction of a new mine, there could be a very big lag between the price going up, and any significant new supply entering the market.

Some people say that if the price goes up any significant amount, a flood of silver will come in from old coins, silverware, jewelry, etc, and correct the problem. In 2011, when silver hit $50/oz, the amount of silver recycled, went up about 50%, from around 100M oz to 150M oz, but that increase was only a small fraction of the mine supply (over 800M oz), so the broader supply demand picture didn’t really change much. There’s still a huge amount of silver in coins, silverware, jewelry, etc, but if it didn’t come back into the market at $50 in 2011, why would it come out of hiding now, for less? Also, although there are still lots of old silver teapots and spoons, they don’t make a lot of new silverware and every year that stockpile shrinks as old spoons get melted down. Much of the silver used in the “silverware” portion of the current demand pie, is used for electroplating, and that silver is never getting recycled.

Over the past several decades, some of the supply demand imbalance in the silver market has come from governments eroding their silver stockpiles. Many countries used to make coinage from silver, so they had to keep stockpiles, both functionally for making more coins, but also as a strategic and central bank asset. Today, the US, Canada, UK, and most other developed countries, have sold the majority of their silver reserves decades ago. The US government had 350M oz in 1970, and around 50M oz from 2006 to today.

&amp;#x200B;

Silver is found in the earths crust at about a 14/1 ratio to gold. Current mine production is about 8/1, and existing stockpiles of investment grade product are not known well enough to compare, but I’ve heard estimates ranging from 3/1 to 1/1. The current price is 68/1. Gold hit it's all time high in 2020, but silver was half it's nominal all time high, or less than a quarter of it's inflation adjusted high.

If you take a more broad view of value over time, gold and silver have historically been valued along the lines of their production and naturally occurring scarcity, from 10/1 to 15/1. This ratio held for thousands of years. If you look at an inflation adjusted chart of silver prices going back many hundreds of years, silver prices were usually many hundreds of dollars. From 1720-1900, the silver price never dipped below $100, and was as high as $500, in todays dollars. For most of the last 3000 years, an average skilled labourers days wage was 0.1 oz of silver.

Lots of people are talking about a shortage of silver, and it’s so much bigger of a deal than most realize. Mints are admitting they can’t source material, and shortages that were once limited to small bars and coins, have spilled over into 1000 oz bars. These days, there are shortages developing in so many things, so it’s seems normal, but this shortage is nothing like the others. As I said at the beginning, if most other shortages are self correcting by the functioning of the markets (planting more corn, etc), but this market is valued based on a stockpile built over 3000 years, then a shortage means we’ve run out of the stockpiles, and the one and only thing that can correct the supply, is higher prices. Given what we saw in 2011, with very little new silver coming back into the market at $50 (or an average though the year in the mid 30’s), it’s safe to conclude that the price it would take to truly balance the market, with no more stack to erode, would have to be dramatically higher than that.

**Demand**

The most important thing to understand about the demand side of the silver equation, is how it’s changed over time. For thousands of years, silver was money. Before the last 150 years, pretty much all the silver ever discovered was still around, and the demand was that it became money the moment it was found. That’s a pretty simple demand case. If you were a prospector in the 1700’s, you could walk into a bar and spend silver or gold you found that day. If you spun some wool, you’d have to trade that for silver or gold before you could spend it.

Then, over time, more and more uses for silver started to appear. This is when silver gained its hybrid, monetary and industrial status, and this status is really key to understanding silver in the world today.

Today, around 60% of silver demand comes from industry, and that demand is quite inelastic. If a company makes smartphones, and the average phone uses $0.35 worth of silver, you don’t stop making phones when the price of silver quadruples, and your phone needs $1.40 worth of silver. Silver is used very broadly, since it’s found in alloys used in most electronics. Because of that broad industrial usage, and the difficulty recovering such small quantities, about 2/3 of the silver consumed is never recovered. If you have a gold watch, someday that watch will break, and the gold will probably end up in a gold bar. If you make a cell phone, one day it will break, and most will end up in a landfill. Even some of the silver that goes through a recycling process still ends up being melted into an alloy so it still isn’t recovered as silver.

Also, industry demand is almost always hard to substitute. Silver is the most conductive element, most reflective element, and has natural anti microbial properties. These properties are elemental and irreplaceable. I’m sure if people could easily use copper instead, they probably already would have. There is a natural trend where a single product, like a solar panel, will use less silver per unit, as manufacturing becomes more and more efficient, but that effect is counteracted by more and more products using silver and higher quantities of production driving that efficiency.

Silver’s industrial demand is highest in fast growing sectors like electric vehicles, solar panels, and electronics. EV’s use significantly more silver that gas cars, and also use lots in their charging infrastructure. The average solar panel uses 0.6 oz of silver, and 5G networks are expected to increase silver demand significantly as they roll out. The trend is clear, the future needs silver, and things that haven’t been invented yet, will probably need the irreplaceable properties only silver can offer.

The other side of silver demand is its monetary or investment demand. At the core of this demand is silver’s historical role as a store of value, as well as the investment case I’ve been spelling out in this and my last post. Silver’s monetary history revolves around it having the key properties of money: durability, portability, divisibility, fungibility, uniformity, limited supply, and acceptability. It’s worth noting that every element on the periodic table that meets these characteristics is already considered money. If you eliminate all gasses, all the elements that are reactive and non durable, all the elements that are too abundant to be portable (lead, iron, etc), the elements that aren’t easily divisible and fungible, so they can’t be divided and reformed, at the end of all that, you are left with only the precious metals. Maybe you can make the case for copper and nickel, but guess what those have been used for.

So, we’ve established that silver is a store of value based on inherent qualities. That makes it a safe haven investment, since people look to stores of value when the future becomes uncertain. For decades now, the world has been lulled into a false sense of security by the US dollar global standard, coinciding with a period of particularly low inflation. A key driver of that period of low inflation, is deflation in prices of consumer goods, because of globalization. Basically, we keep printing more and more money, but China keeps cheaply producing more and more products. This has kept inflation contained in localized asset bubbles (stocks, real estate, art), and most people haven’t seen it effect their lives much (until recently). That could change quickly. The low prices we’ve grown accustomed to, probably won’t keep dropping as we keep printing more money. In short, once China already produces everything, there’s no prices left to bring down to offset the printer.

For years, pretty much every country in the world has been printing money like crazy, and the only thing that makes it not look crazy, is the fact that everyone else is doing it, and currencies are only valued relative to other currencies. People call this the race to debase. Inflation has gone from a non issue in the minds of the world, to the issue of the day, and that’s unlikely to change any time soon.

Much of the developed world has forgotten about gold and silver, with academics referring to it as a barbarous relic, and with the biggest pools of money, hedge funds, pension funds, endowment funds, collectively owning less than 1% of their portfolios in gold, and presumably a fraction of that amount in silver. For individuals, the percentages are probably a bit higher than for funds, but as a share of all wealth in the west, precious metals are a rounding error, even today and even with all the attention we give to the space. It’s just not on most people’s radar yet.

Basically, we have a good case that demand should be higher, but it’s actually pretty low in the grand scheme of things, with most individuals owning none and even the biggest funds not bothering to hold any. Despite this, let’s consider how the market is holding up to this (actually very low) demand.

I can remember a couple times when interest among retail investors spiked up, and premiums on coins and small bars went up dramatically. Every time this happened before 2020, the market would stabilize in months and premiums would fall back down. Producers of small bars and coins got a bigger incentive to make more, so they did, and the market calmed. In 2011, my local dealer would sell me high premium coins, but he could also get me 1000 oz bars at $0.60 over spot.

When covid hit, premiums rose again, but this time they stayed high. The reason is that this time the shortage is across the entire market. My local dealer passes on the prices he pays with a small markup, and his prices have stayed high on coins and bars, but also now his premiums on 1000 oz bars are up to $2.50. Shortages have reached every corner of the market, and there could soon be a time when it simply becomes unavailable.

Scarcity is an incredible driver of behaviour. There are a lot of companies who really rely on silver, and who currently use just in time inventory, so they can’t keep their operations going for long without new inventory. If I recall the toilet paper aisle in March 2020, when people start to sense a shortage, they tend to stock up. Unlike toilet paper, this won’t just be driven by fear and need. This would be driven by fear, need, want and greed. Imagine if toilet paper were a target of huge speculators that could easily and cheaply, house many years of global production, and suppliers couldn’t easily ramp up production, to respond to the shortage. It probably would have left a whole lot more desperate people, willing to pay a whole lot more.

Silver is a market that probably deserves more demand than it’s getting, but in reality has so little demand that the biggest funds and investors barely notice that it exists. Even this tiny demand has been enough to clean out existing stockpiles and create a shortage. The sleeping dragon in this situation is that industrial users need to buy, regardless of price or market conditions. Prices will rise, shortages will grow, and then industrial users will have to compete with a larger and larger group of investors for scarce supply.

**Summary**

This is a small market, with growing and inelastic demand, and an existing supply demand imbalance, that has been eroding available inventories for years. It’s currently in short supply (in an investable, deliverable form), and that shortage is getting worse by the day. The silver market is historically prone to wild spikes, and this time, a large spike up in price would actually be reverting to a more normal historical price (over the very long term), in terms of the ratio with gold, and in absolute inflation adjusted price. The physical price diverging from the paper price may force the Comex and LBMA to make more deliveries than they are basically built for, dry up any available inventory, and may cause a large number of paper contracts to owe physical metal they have no way of obtaining at anywhere near current prices.

Industrial users are the sleeping dragon in this situation, needing hundreds of millions of oz per year to operate their businesses, and historically relying on just in time inventory. Now they are being forced to wait to get inventory, and may start to see a shortage ahead. Some may decide that the risk of not getting product or having to pay much higher prices is too great, so they need to take some of the dwindling inventory for themselves. The more scarce it becomes, the more industry will want to stock up. Speculators will get wind of this, and further compete for the last scraps of bullion.

This situation looks to me like a big bonfire, soaking in the gasoline of paper leverage, that may ignite anytime. I’ll be sitting by with my marshmallows, waiting to sell into a market that might look much different than when I bought.","My long as hell, silver DD",1625011812

I am not saying that it will not be a major player but in way is it worth such a multiple of Carmax, Autonation, Lithia etc..

Firstly, the revenue is not there yet. We just coming off a very hot used car market and shortage in the new car side. Book values are crazy and CARVANA is putting and has been putting to much money in cars. Where are they going to get the inventory to reach the revenue of others?

They have no service or parts like the new car franchises which is a big revenue and profit center. F&amp;I products sales penetration is less with online as well. They have their own financing which i suppose is their big feature like carmax or even better Drivetime. 

The online buying and delivery option can be done by any other franchise. There is nothing unique to it. If you look how lithia motors for example expands their used car inventory in 500mile areas to compete. 

They spend a lot of advertising dollars on Cargurus, [car.com](https://car.com) etc.. With online only what are their conversions like compared to the others that have active sales departments.

**Financial Summary for Fiscal Fourth Quarter 2021 vs. Fiscal Fourth Quarter 2020**

* Sales for the quarter were $24.2 million – an increase of 409\*\*%\*\*
* Gross Profit Margins increased to approximately 23% – an increase of 179%
* Operating expenses as a percentage of sales decreased 58\*\*%\*\*
* Adjusted EBITDA increased to $4.8 million — an increase of 296%
* Adjusted EPS increased to $0.04 – an increase of 167%

**Financial Summary for Fiscal 2021 vs. Fiscal 2020**

* Sales for the year increased to $62.5 million – an increase of 300%
* Gross Profit Margins increased to approximately 18% — an increase of 173%
* Operating expenses as a percentage of sales decreased 61\*\*%\*\*

* Adjusted EPS Increased to $0.07 — an increase of 150%

AMMO is positioned for exceptional growth in Fiscal 2022 after establishing a new standard for the Company. Demand fundamentals in the US domestic ammunition market are exceedingly strong and we are seeing no indication of slowing. The Company broke ground on its new state-of-the-art plant, scheduled to be fully operational in approximately one year. And we have established the Company as a cutting-edge design firm, announcing a contract for the design and manufacture of technologically advanced ballistic match ammunition for the US Department of Defense. Our fiscal fourth quarter delivered the best quarterly performance in Company history, with even better quarters reasonably expected to follow throughout Fiscal 2022.

Additionally, the Company experienced sales growth of 46\*\*%\*\* quarter-over-quarter, a $7.6 million increase.

The Company’s margins have also increased to approximately 23% for our fourth fiscal quarter, an increase of 179% or $7.1 million year-over-year. When depreciation and amortization are added back to the cost of goods sold, our gross profit margin increases to 27% for the quarter.

Our operating expenses as a percentage of sales was 25\*\*%**, representing a 58**%\*\* decrease from the prior year quarter. For the year, our operating expense as a percentage of sales was 27%, a 61% decrease from the prior year.

Net Loss for the quarter was approximately $463,000, which includes approximately $3.4 million of non-cash expenses. Net Loss for the year was approximately $7.8 million, which also included $10.1 million in non-cash expenses.

Adjusted EBITDA has grown to $4.8 million for the quarter – 296% increase from the prior year. For the year, our Adjusted EBITDA was $8.1 million – 213% increase from the prior year.

The continuing improvement in adjusted EBITDA and margin shows the impact of the scaling we are beginning to see in our operational costs. We expect our first half fiscal 2022 EBITDA to be better than the second half of fiscal 2021 as a standalone.

AMMO’s adjusted earnings per share (EPS) increased to $0.04 for our fiscal fourth quarter, representing a 167% year-over-year increase. Our adjusted EPS increased to $0.07 for the year, representing a 150% increase from the prior year. Adjusted EPS is a metric the Company values as we believe it is a better representation of the Company’s true operating performance.

The revenue guidance for the 1st quarter of our 2022 Fiscal Year is $41M and will include two months of operations from our newly acquired Gunbroker.com assets.

Riding off what the gentleman shared above, I would like to share my opinion on the *when* to buy in. 


The stock, as seen in the daily chart [over here](https://imgur.com/RbgmdOk)  has been ranging for a while. Mostly I would say because of profit taking and seemingly reaccumulation of positions.





This means, whoever has been reaccumulating here has a strong position to send the stock to another rally. This is also seen by how it seems ready to move as it retests last point of support (see **lps** on the chart) would be the last test it needed before taking off. 






**Full Disclosure**; I have [a few shares](https://imgur.com/KrheSmb) shares in the company already and now waiting for my the market to react.  







**Other Similar Examples;**


A recent example of such a range and break out can be found on the [$NVDA](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o9mutj/nvda_play_100_based_on_ta/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share))  post I shared. Entry was also on breakout but I've also recently got into [$ATOS ](https://imgur.com/UCR8oTH) with a few shares [at retest ](https://imgur.com/YhMaAzY) of the break out and $INTC [based on](https://www.reddit.com/r/SwingTradingTA/comments/o746pc/intc_reaccumulation_range_i_notice_a_lot_of_the/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) the price action analysis of the trading range. 

Others are $AAPL and $AMZN that seem ready to break. 





TL;DR - $HIMX about to breakout and a possible rally may ensue.

Example of the stock market as a game were a few win and most others lose money, the common denominator for all players is still the presence of risk. Regardless of Buffet's, Jim Simmons, Soro’s etc. winning track record, they cannot be immune to risk because there simply is no free lunch. But they are inoculated from “losing money” via an edge in the antidote drug of technology, big money, research, psychology, and even illegal insider info that separates them from the rest. But just because you are inoculated from a disease doesn't mean you can't die by many other means. So consider “losing money” the disease, having an “edge” the antidote, and “risk” being hit by a bus, being swallowed by a sink hole, hit by a stray bullet etc. 

There must be something (or many things) that can bring portfolios of Buffet and Simmons down although does that something bring everyone else down as well?

Tl;DR:

Tesla entered the S&amp;P 500 to great fanfare on Dec. 21, 2020, in a rebalance of the index. It surged well over 20% in its first month, but since then has fallen, standing now with gains of about 5%, lagging the S&amp;P 500’s (^GSPC) near-16% gain in that same timeframe.

Tesla’s entry meant one company had to leave, as the S&amp;P 500 does not become the S&amp;P 501 when a new company joins the club. To make room, S&amp;P had to kick out Apartment Investment and Management (AIV) from the index, but since that December 2020 rebalance, the company’s stock spiked almost 60% — and though it went down still stands around 40% higher than it did when it got the boot.",The company Tesla booted from the S&amp;P 500 is outperforming it,1624991730

I don't really think this is the case and I feel that many investors are essentially missing out on an easy pitch with Intel's future developments.


Special DD to satisfy ""high effort"" posting in a discussion flair:

""Thanks for joining today. Intel delivered a strong Q1 that beat our January guide on both the top and bottom line, driven by exceptional demand for our products and exquisite execution by our team. We shipped a record volume of notebook CPUs. We launched new competitive Intel Core and Xeon processors.

Mobileye had its best quarter ever. With tremendous industry support, we unveiled our IDM 2.0 strategy, setting a bold new course for technology leadership at Intel. The response from employees, partners, and customers has been incredible. Our teams are reinvigorated, innovating, and executing.

The PC ecosystem, in particular, is experiencing a resurgence. This remote work and learning dynamics of COVID led to more PC shipments in 2020 than at any point since 2012, and that's continuing. 2021 is shaping up to be the largest PC market ever. In fact, we shipped more notebook CPUs in Q1 than in any other quarter in our history

Total platform unit volumes were up well over 30% in the first quarter. In many markets, one PC in every home is no longer enough. The number of PCs per household, what we call PC density, is increasing. We are seeing strong growth in education where, on a global basis, the number of PCs per 100 students and teachers still remains in the single digits.

Every student needs a laptop, and we have a long way to go. In addition, there are over 400 million PCs running Windows 10 that are over four years old today, which is an enormous PC refresh opportunity. Intel is leading this rejuvenation of the PC with marketing, user experience, and purpose-built innovation at the software, silicon, and platform level. We shipped Tiger Lake-H for notebooks and Rocket Lake for desktops, and customer reception has been enthusiastic.

As a sign of our improving execution, we qualified Tiger Lake-H ahead of schedule in 10 nanometers, and we expect 10-nanometer unit volumes to cross over 14 nanometers in the second half of the year. Our Intel Evo platform gives buyers the very best mobile experience, and we're deepening our ecosystem engagement with partners, including Microsoft, Google, and Samsung to advance the PC experience in new, innovative ways. We see no signs of PC demand slowing and believe the industry will return to shipping more than 1 million units a day. With over 100 million Xeon servers in the installed base, the world runs on Intel.

Building on that foundation, we recently launched our most advanced high-performance data center platform optimized to power the industry's broadest range of workloads from the cloud to the network to the intelligent edge. At the heart of this is our new third-gen Intel Xeon Scalable processor codenamed Ice Lake, which offers nearly 50% gen-over-gen performance improvements across a range of workloads. We are already shipping Ice Lake to more than 30 customers, including major cloud providers, communication service providers, enterprise and HPC customers. Another trend driving demand for more and more optimized computing performance is the infusion of artificial intelligence and machine learning into nearly every application.

As the only x86 datacenter CPU with built-in AI acceleration, Ice Lake provides 74% gen-over-gen improvement on AI workloads. And our Habana discrete solutions address the needs of those customers with extreme AI demands in areas like training. Sometimes customers want both. For example, you see San Diego will use Intel Xeon and Habana AI accelerators to power their new Voyager supercomputer.

Mobileye set a new quarterly record. Mobileye's assisted driving technology continues to win over automakers with eight new design wins in Q1. We have programs with 13 of the 15 top automotive OEMs. Mobileye continues to open new categories such as delivery transport with the win at Udelv and is rapidly evolving to power L4 fully autonomous robotaxis beginning next year.

We continue to have extraordinary success winning the next-generation 5G environments. A great example from this quarter is our collaboration with Google Cloud to develop solutions that help communication service providers accelerate 5G deployment across multiple network and edge locations. We're already seeing significant adoption of OneAPI and OneAPI-powered toolkits for high-performance computing, AI, and data analytics. Developers and customers are embracing One API's open standards-based approach for unified programming across architectures and vendors.

 This includes leading cloud service providers who are embracing OneAPI at scale. The unprecedented demand for semiconductors has stressed supply chains across the industry. We've doubled our internal wafer capacity in the last few years, but the industry is now challenged by a shortage of foundry capacity, substrates, and components. We expect it will take a couple of years for the ecosystem to make the significant investments to address these shortages.

This fundamental industry challenge underscores the importance of our unique and differentiated IDM 2.0 strategy. IDM 2.0 utilizes our internal factory network to reliably deliver leadership products and provide the industry another source of foundry capacity through our new Intel Foundry Services. Leveraging our IDM advantage, we are working aggressively across our global supply chain to solve substrate shortages to satisfy our customers' surging demand and gain market share. For example, by partnering closely with our suppliers, we are creatively utilizing our internal assembly factory network to remove a major constraint in our substrate supply.

Coming online in Q2, this capability will increase the availability of millions of units in 2021. It's a great example where the IDM model gives us flexibility to address the dynamic market. It's clear the industry and Intel will need more capacity to meet strong future demand, which is why we are dramatically expanding our foundry capability with Intel Foundry Services starting with a $20 billion investment for our first large-scale foundry operations in Arizona. We plan to expand other locations and establish Intel Foundry Services as a major provider of committed foundry capacity in the U.S. and Europe while ensuring a sustainable and secure semiconductor supply for the world. Since its announcement, the industry response to Intel Foundry Services has already been incredible. We are engaged with well over 50 potential customers today. We're seeing excitement from some of the top technology giants in the world across industry verticals ranging from automotive to high-performance compute and cloud service providers

We've been responding to and proactively engaging with automotive component suppliers on how we can help them with their supply chains and alleviate shortages in both the near and long term. We're doing our part to address this global supply crisis, but we cannot do it alone. The investment needed at the scale required is immense, and it will require close industry and government partnership to address this need. Governments around the world are recognizing the critical nature of semiconductors and the need to increase advanced chip manufacturing capacity and prepare for the future.

We are encouraged by President Biden's recognition of semiconductor manufacture as a critical component of our national infrastructure and its inclusion along with key research and infrastructure investments in broadband in the American Jobs plan. Looking ahead, we're confident our strategy will drive innovation and technology leadership for Intel. 7 nanometers is progressing well, and IDM 2.0 puts us on a path to restore process performance leadership and build on our industry-leading packaging technologies. With IDM 2.0, we will have superior capacity and supply resilience by leveraging our internal and external capacity and a superior cost structure.

By accelerating our clock rate of innovation, we will deliver leadership products in every category. In the PC business, we will follow the successful launches of Tiger Lake and Rocket Lake with Alder Lake, which is currently sampling and will ship in the second half of this year. Within the next couple of weeks, we'll tape in the compute tile for Meteor Lake, our first 7-nanometer CPU for 2023. In the data center, we will follow the strong ramp of Ice Lake with Sapphire Rapids, which is scheduled to reach production around the end of this year, and ramp in the first half of 2022.

Overall, our 2023 road maps are firm and under execution, and our 2024 and 2025 plans are well under way to provide unquestioned leadership products in every category we participate in. The Intel innovation machine is fired up. Before I pass it to George for the details in the quarter, let me reiterate how excited I am to be back. You can feel the energy inside of Intel, the passion to innovate, and the drive that made us great.""",Be greedy when others are fearful part II - Intel,1624982080

**With more than half of Americans admitting to shopping for their BBQ supplies last-minute, limited edition grilling kits provide a convenient solution beginning July 1**

SAN FRANCISCO, June 28, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- DoorDash (NYSE: DASH), the nation's leading last-mile logistics platform, announced today a partnership with Beyond Meat**®**, a leader in plant-based meat, to offer limited-edition, July 4th grilling kits to help customers host the ultimate BBQ featuring this summer's hottest grilling essential: the sizzling new Beyond Burger®. The kits are available exclusively on DoorDash for on-demand delivery from [DashMart](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3209823-1&amp;h=575202139&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.doordash.com%2Fintroducing-dashmart-1891ecc0257d&amp;a=DashMart), a new type of convenience store owned, operated, and curated by DoorDash.

&amp;#x200B;

 

As many people prepare for a summer of grilling and gathering, the kit also provides a seamless way for consumers to get their grilling essentials without taking a last-minute trip to the grocery store. According to a national consumer survey that polled 1,000 U.S. adults\*:  


* **Grilling is king:** Nearly three quarters (73%) of Americans agree that grilling is a must-do activity this summer -- more than visiting family (69.4%), traveling long distances (42.7%) and going on dates (36.1%).
* **Plant-based meat -- good for you and for BBQ**: Consumers are increasingly reaching for plant-based options. Over three quarters (78%) of Americans want plant-based meat at cookouts and BBQs, and more than half (65%) are choosing plant-based options to eat healthier -- particularly millennials.
* **Delivery to the cookout rescue:** Nearly everyone (91%) can relate to needing supplies in a pinch. More than half (60%) of Americans admit to shopping for their BBQ supplies last-minute, with nearly three-quarters (72%) forgetting an item when they do so.

 

In addition to the Beyond Burger®, the grilling kits offer a custom grilling mit, apron, grilling tools, a bottle opener and a recipe card with custom dishes. The new burger is crafted to look, cook and taste like beef while offering strong nutritional benefits—such as: 35% less fat, 35% less saturated fat, fewer calories and no cholesterol compared to an 80/20 ground beef burger patty—to bring the thrill of grilling plant-based meat to a backyard near you. Additional items*—*from snacks, beverages, ice cream and more*—*can be purchased on-demand from DashMart to complete the gathering.

""This 4th of July weekend, we're excited to partner with DoorDash to further our mission to make plant-based options more accessible to all,"" said Rebecca Infusino, VP of Retail Sales, Beyond Meat. ""There's nothing more classic and delicious than a perfectly grilled, juicy burger on a hot summer day. We've made this classic pastime even better this summer with the great taste and nutritional benefits of our newest Beyond Burger, and the unbeatable convenience of having it delivered to your BBQ in under an hour.""

""We're thrilled to partner with Beyond Meat to offer customers their favorite grilling essentials conveniently from DashMart,"" said Andrew Ladd, Director of New Verticals at DoorDash. ""At DoorDash we're committed to bringing customers all the best of their neighborhoods for every occasion, and as summer gets under way we're excited to unveil this exclusive kit perfect for any BBQ while giving people access to the essentials they need on-demand.""

The limited-edition kits will be available exclusively on DashMart starting July 1 for $14.99, while supplies last, in 14 cities across the United States, including:

* Baltimore, MD
* Chicago, IL
* Cincinnati, OH
* Columbus, OH
* Dallas, TX
* Denver, CO
* Detroit, MI

But a new study from the London School of Economics says 50 years of such tax cuts have only helped one group — the rich.  
&gt;  
&gt;The new paper, by David Hope of the London School of Economics and Julian Limberg of King's College London, examines 18 developed countries — from Australia to the United States — over a 50-year period from 1965 to 2015. The study compared countries that passed tax cuts in a specific year, such as the U.S. in 1982 when President Ronald Reagan slashed taxes on the wealthy, with those that didn't, and then examined their economic outcomes.   
&gt;  
&gt;Per capita gross domestic product and unemployment rates were nearly identical after five years in countries that slashed taxes on the rich and in those that didn't, the study found.   
&gt;  
&gt;But the analysis discovered one major change: The incomes of the rich grew much faster in countries where tax rates were lowered. Instead of trickling down to the middle class, tax cuts for the rich may not accomplish much more than help the rich keep more of their riches and exacerbate income inequality, the research indicates.

 [50-year study of tax cuts on wealthy shows they always fail to ""trickle down"" | Salon.com](https://www.salon.com/2020/12/27/50-year-study-of-tax-cuts-on-wealthy-shows-they-always-fail-to-trickle-down/)",50 years of tax cuts for the rich failed to trickle down,1624975212

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

Every time I say that certain hyped stock is overvalued and they’re overpaying for growth, they automatically downvote you because they don’t want to hear the truth.

stocks,"Romeo Power is at $8.48 as of this post, but I believe it will soon be much higher. I will keep it to the point. Romeo Power's stock was heavily beaten down after revising down 2021 revenues because of cell supply shortages that affected the entire EV market. It appears these cell shortages are being addressed and could allow them to get back on track with forward revenues- some EV related stocks have already recovered, but RMO has been left out of the recent run. On May 13th, the company announced they had made major updates to cell supplier agreements and were ""Shortly signing a deal for multiple gigawatt hours with a top tier supplier"" - Lionel Selwood, CEO. It has been over 6 weeks now since this statement, which drives me to speculate that ""shortly"" is almost here, especially with the management addition announcement on June 16th for their new CFO, Kerry Shiba - who has managed Billions of dollars for several decades, and has helped many companies outperform. 

&amp;#x200B;

Speaking of ""short,"" the current float is 24% shares short, as the company is barely 25-30% off of its all time lows of $6.60, and over 80% off of its all time high of $38. Mind you, this company has deals to produce with PACCAR and BorgWarner. BorgWarner is also a major shareholder in the company. This is a legit and well resourced company that seems to have taken a series of overreaction hits the last several months. 

&amp;#x200B;

Vanguard recently added over 7.5m Shares in their index funds on 6/1, and now own around 15M shares out of the 94M available in public float. BlackRock is also in on this with atleast 2M shares. The company was also included in the Russell 3000 on June 25th. Most analysts have an average fair value of $12-15, implying 45-80% upside from current price. We've seen this ticker jump over 50% in one day on April 6th and I don't think that was the last time we'll see that, and I think if we do get cell supplier news with a ""top tier supplier"" Panasonic, LG, BYD, or any of the giants which are mostly Asia based-  this time the gains might truly stick, as a solution to the cell supply shortages are the looming piece of news, that I'm sure Romeo's management knows, will shift the investor sentiment entirely.

Iridium provides mobile voice and data communications services to businesses, the United States and foreign governments, non-governmental organizations, and consumers globally via satellite. They also provide prepaid mobile voice satellite communications, push-to-talk, broadband data, and Internet of Things (IoT) services. The Iridium network operates in the [L-band](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L_band) and has [66 low Earth orbiting satellites](https://sbs-satbill.com/iridium-billing-platform/) and provides coverage to the entire globe, including the poles. Iridium increases coverage by using multiple satellites (constellation) creating a 'net' around Earth. Globalstar is another satellite service providers with a constellation in this orbit.

**BULL ARGUMENT**

Iridium has the largest constellation and orbits closer to Earth than any other networks. This allows for shorter network registration times and low communications latency. Globalstar only has [48 satellites](https://sbs-satbill.com/globalstar-billing-platform/) and *does not* cover the poles. Specifically, Globalstar only has coverage [between the latitudes 70 north and -70 south](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1023/A:1019164909332).

In addition to having more satellites and more coverage of the Earth, [Iridium was certified](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/worlds-first-truly-global-real-time-maritime-emergency-service-launched-by-iridium-301193130.html) to use in the Global Maritime Distress and Safety System in December 2020. This ended a monopoly that had previously been held by Inmarsat since the system started in 1999.

Iridium is already a top key-player for global maritime satellite communications. The respective market was valued at $2.39B in 2021 and is [expected to reach $3.96B in the next 5 years](https://www.marketwatch.com/press-release/global-maritime-satellite-communication-market-2021-is-expected-to-register-a-cagr-of-69-with-top-countries-data-industry-size-share-business-growth-revenue-trends-market-demand-penetration-and-forecast-2021-06-15). That is a CAGR of 6.9%.

Iridium just secured a [$30M R&amp;D contract](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/iridium-awarded-30-million-research--development-contract-by-the-united-states-army-301318757.html) with the United States Army to develop a payload to provide more effective sensor-to-soldier data transmission when in the field. Matt Desch, CEO of Iridium, commented on the contract, ""This is one of the largest engineering contracts in Iridium's history... It also represents another phase in the evolution of our growing relationship with the Department of Defense."" Moreover, the U.S. Department of Defense has partnered with Iridium for more than 20 years and is the largest customer. In September 2019, Iridium secured a [7-year, $738.5M](https://spacenews.com/iridium-lands-seven-year-738-5-million-defense-department-contract/) contract with the Department of Defense for unlimited use of the Iridium satellite constellation.

Iridium completed a [$3B multi-year constellation upgrade](https://investor.iridium.com/2019-02-06-Iridium-Declares-Victory-3-Billion-Satellite-Constellation-Upgrade-Complete) in 2019, replacing all satellites and upgrading the supporting ground infrastructure. To complete the upgrade, eight Falcon 9 rockets were used to launch 75 satellites into low Earth orbit ([66 operational, 9 in-orbit spares](https://www.roadpost.com/iridium-satellite-network)). Final payments to SpaceX for those launches were made during the second quarter of 2019.

**BEAR ARGUMENT**

Iridium relies on single-source suppliers for the manufacture of most of the subscriber equipment, and purchases parts that are periodically subject to shortages. There is a large reliance on a few significant customers, particularly U.S. government agencies meaning a loss of that business will significantly impact revenue. Moreover, Iridium relies on a single primary commercial gateway and primary satellite network operations center.

Last, but not least, Iridium is in debt. Specifically, [$1.39B as of March 2021](https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/telecom/nasdaq-irdm/iridium-communications/news/does-iridium-communications-nasdaqirdm-have-a-healthy-balanc). Iridium also has liabilities of $88.3M falling due within a year and liabilities of $1.81B due beyond that which outweigh the cash and short-term receivables by $1.62B.

**CONCLUSION**

I'm bullish on Iridium and I only see good things for the long term. Although in debt, I think Iridium can handle the current debt levels. They continue to be the front runner for government contracts and are the only provider that covers the entire globe. From December 2019 to December 2020, Iridium saw an increase of 176K subscribers (14%) and I believe this will continue to grow. Voice and data, and IoT revenues have historically generated higher margins than subscriber equipment revenue, and this trend will likely continue. The diverse customer base including end-users in land-mobile, IoT, maritime, aviation, and government will continue to grow overtime.

stocks,"BASICS

This is a gamble, but I think it has limited downside and significant upside potential. I have taken some small positions to leverage a potential rise in gold prices over the next 6 months.

$GOLD and $KGC are both fundamentally sound, well established companies. In terms of P/E valuation they are both trading at moderate discounts - $GOLD about 25% &amp; $KGC about 40%, compared to industry average. Both of these companies trend with, but do not directly track, the price of gold. The gap in P/E valuation should close, especially if gold prices get back close to $2000/oz.

In addition to the Fed tanking gold prices after their meeting, at about the same time $KGC reported a fire at their Tasiast project mine in Mauritania. They have since provided a mostly positive assessment of the damage, and mining operations have resumed. They did however revise the 2021 projected output for the mine down to 2.1m oz. from 2.4m oz.

Gold took a decent hit after the Fed meeting. Prices dropped from about $1900/oz to about $1750/oz in a week. As a result, share prices for $GOLD &amp; $KGC have taken a hit. Before the Fed meeting $GOLD was trading at the $23-$24+ level. $GOLD closed @ $20.89 on 25 June. $KGC was trading around $8.00 before the Fed meeting and the fire, closed @ $6.38 on 25 June. Here are some price points for comparison.

&amp;#x200B;

* Gold price peak 6 Aug 2020 - $2071.05
* $GOLD 18 Aug 2020 - $31.22
* $KGC 19 Sep 2020 - $10.31

&amp;#x200B;

* Gold price before Fed 14 Jun 2021 - $1859.45
* $GOLD before Fed 14 Jun 2021 - $23.15
* $KGC before Fed 14 Jun 2021 - $7.76

&amp;#x200B;

* Gold close 25 Jun 2021 - $1781.70
* $GOLD close 25 Jun 2021 - $20.89
* $KGC close 25 Jun 2021 - $6.38

FUTURE PRICE FACTORS

Predicting the price of gold is tricky, and frankly there are many factors which are beyond my level of understanding. My thinking is this: Inflation is real, significant and not transitory. As the US and other economies continue reopening, and inflation begins to squeeze the budgets of more and more working people, regardless of what the statistics say, it is going to become more commonly reported in the news. The result will be that retail goldbugs will put persistent upward pressure on the price of gold, even if central banks try to mitigate the rise. I also expect commodities in general to recover and rise through the rest of 2021. Gold is a unique commodity, but commodity price increases should apply upward pressure on gold as well. I don’t predict the price to spike to new ATH’s (although it could), but I do expect the price to be back to $1900 level or higher by EOY.

On the downside, I really don’t see gold prices falling significantly from here. For that to happen I think you would need to see a roaring US economy with moderately and steadily rising interest rates, significantly tightening money supply, very moderate inflation, and a profoundly strong dollar. That seems like a black swan from where we are now.

$GOLD and $KGC have floats of 1.8B and 1.3B shares respectively, so they can't be pushed around for very long. While high volume can have an impact on price short-term, because the earnings and values of these companies are so closely tied to the price of gold, longs won't be able to hold the price artificially high, and shorts won't be able to hold the price artificially low for an extended period.

CURRENT POSITIONS:

&amp;#x200B;

* 100 shares $GOLD
* 300 shares $KGC
* 20 x $GOLD 20220122 $25C
* 40 x $KGC 20220122 $10C

$KGC options are a bit more speculative than $GOLD, but both are cheap right now, with low to moderate IV, and decent theta. Both chains have good liquidity.

BOTTOM LINE

If you think the price of gold will be going up through the rest of the year, $GOLD and $KGC are both cheap buys now. If you think the price of gold is going up but aren’t sure it will be before the end of the year, buy shares and skip the options. Owning these companies should provide gains much better than owning actual gold or gold ETF’s. Based on previous price points, if gold rises 6.6% to $1900, I expect $GOLD up conservatively 15% to $24.00, and $KGC about 25% to $8.00. Those are conservative estimates. The Marketbeat analyst consensus PT for $GOLD is $33.25 and for $KGC it is $10.54. Overall, I'm looking for a 2-3 bagger on this play. Will reevaluate at the end of the summer, unless there is a big move before then.

I’ve seen lots of posts commenting “the stock is xx% shorted!” So posting to clarify something:

Short volume is NOT the same as short interest! Very big difference, do not confuse the two and spread misinformation. 

- Short volume is number of shares sold short and traded that DAY. 

- Short interest is the total % of the float out on loan being shorted. 

- Short volume is almost always higher than short interest. Also as volume increases so does short volume. 

- They are not tied to each other. Short volume can in theory be one shorted share traded back and forth 1 million times to show a short volume of 1 million. In reality it is almost always the same group of shorted shares, or people trading on preexisting shorted positions. Increasing short volume ≠ short interest. Correlation does NOT imply causation. 

*Short volume does NOT trigger a gamma squeeze nor a short squeeze.*

I have seen many posts saying various stocks are “ XX% shorted” when in reality they are referring to the short volume. Most of these stocks are too diluted to experience a gamma squeeze or a short squeeze.

Also people saying “short interest increased XX% overnight” Short interest reporting does not happen overnight, it’s monthly for FINRA and always 2 weeks delayed, as the report month end and release the reports 2 weeks later.

**Mining vs producing:** Something people are bringing up to me a lot, which is a good point, is why this company is not mining until 2028 if they do and why they are putting up a factory immediately.  It's a good question and it made me concerned also.  I did some research and apparently Biden's administration wants US EV manufacturing dominance to be on the processing side and NOT the mining side.  They'd rather let other countries mine, then ship to us on barges, where we process it.  So in this case mined graphite processed into battery grade graphite.  source:   [Exclusive: Biden looks abroad for electric vehicle metals, in blow to U.S. miners | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/biden-looks-abroad-electric-vehicle-metals-blow-us-miners-2021-05-25/)

**Production timelines:** Some people brought up to me the fact that it wouldn't be 2022 until they were producing, tbh this made no sense to me.

**Competition:** People brought up to me stocks like $NMG, Syraah mining, and others that are trying to mine and produce graphite.  I did some research and these are sort of prop up companies that aren't really ready yet, REDACTED style, they are going after mining right away and mostly mining.  They don't seem to have a production focus and none are US based, so I personally don't like them as much.

**Commodity prices:** Some people pointed out to me that commodity prices, which graphite is one, fluctuate.  I have two things to say about this, first this is only relevant to miners since they sell graphite, not to end products for EV (battery grade, refined balls of processed graphite).  Two, EV demand will be there, so demand for graphite will be there, so demand will lead to supply constraints, which will lead to graphite producers benefitting.

**Alternative batteries:** Some people brought up solid state batteries, silicon anodes replacing graphite anodes, and other possible changes in the science landscape.  I would say, none of these even work yet.",DD Follow up: $WWR,1624920079

When moat ratings change or the discount to  fair value becomes comparatively noncompetitive with others, the  position is replaced. Not only do the components change based on moat  rating and discount to fair value, but the portfolio is re-balanced to  an equal weighting as well.

stocks,"It is known that America’s economy runs on 3 things: McDonald’s, freedom, and guns. There are not many things that Americans enjoy more than these 3 items; however, some say ammo is a close contender. We are currently experiencing an ammo shortage like no other. [People are currently scalping ammo and selling it for 3-4X MARK UP.](https://outsider.com/outdoors/viral/ammo-shortage-scalpers-buying-ammunition-profit-resale-making-issue-worse/) This is insane and we have not had a shortage of ammo like this before. 

If we take a look at the charts of one of the largest gun manufacturers and ammunition providers in the US, Smith &amp; Wesson (&amp;SWBI), you can see their stock price has rose over 60% in the last 10 trading days. This is due to them blowing their earnings expectations out of the water and a share buyback announcement. In the conference call with the higher ups of &amp;SWBI, the CEO himself states the shortage may continue to worsen and he does not believe it will get better anytime soon. 

Now here comes the good stuff: Ammo inc., also known as $POWW. This is a relatively new company that was listed on the NASDAQ on December 2020. They have some of the best financials you can hope for. Here is a link to their [investor presentation in April.]( https://ammoinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/AMMO-Inc.-Investor-Presentation-April-2021.pdf) Going back to the fiscal year of 2018, they are experiencing and projecting a 160.6% CAGR which is amazing. Their guidance for their net sales in 2021 was reported as $58M; however, they have now increased their guidance to $62.2M. For a company to increase their guidance by so much in such a short amount of time, you know good things are cooking. Due to this being the end of fiscal year of 2021 for this company, the addition to their guidance will be portrayed in their next earnings report, which comes out TOMORROW. I am banking on the fact that they will blowout their earnings just like Smith &amp; Wesson. Their net sales, gross margin, and adjusted EBITDA are increasing tremendously year over year. They recently acquired a US department of defense contract to manufacture multi-purpose rounds. The company is becoming more and more financially efficient while also being in an extremely high demand area. 

If the earnings are not spectacular tomorrow, then this will still be a good long term hold due to &amp;POWW’s exciting future. They are building a new production facility in Wisconsin that will increase their production capacity by over 100%. This facility will be finished and in production in early 2022. Just the fact that ammo in such high demand and experts believe it will not get better anytime soon, I feel good about this play.",$POWW potential run up,1624917608

Stocks traded mixed today, with the Dow Jones (DIA) underperforming while the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and the Nasdaq (QQQ) kept pushing higher, with each recording new intraday highs, encouraged by the Fed’s outlook that interest rates won’t be raised until 2023. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield fell, hovering near 1.48%, an encouraging sign for equities. Looking ahead, market participants are waiting for the June Jobs Report, set to be released this Friday. Consensus economists are looking for payroll gains to accelerate to 700,000 in June with an unemployment rate down slightly to 5.7%, with these metrics improving against May's payroll gains of 559,000 and jobless rate of 5.8%. 

Last week, President Joe Biden announced he had reached an infrastructure agreement with a bipartisan group of senators, which catalyzed a jump in industrial stocks that had been lagging the last few weeks. The deal, which would cost $1.2 trillion over the next five years, commits  $312 billion toward traditional infrastructure priorities such as roads, bridges, public transit, airports and waterways. The bulk of the remainder will be invested in water, broadband and power grid restoration, according to a fact sheet provided by the White House. 

Gabriela Santos, global market strategist at JP Morgan said, “The way we're thinking about it is, it has the positive side of the deal in terms of the equity market perspective: More spending on physical infrastructure, electric vehicles, 5G and broadband, without the tax increases which would have been a negative from the equity market perspective. This is certainly a positive especially for the more domestic, cyclical-heavy parts of the market, as well as parts of technology like semiconductors, which are more related to the 5G and the green theme."" 

Moreover, the Federal Reserve released the results of its “stress test” on US banks, an annual test instituted after the 2008 financial crisis meant to determine the financial health of lenders during an extreme hypothetical financial crisis (not unlike what was experienced last year).The test used a hypothetical “severely adverse” scenario where the U.S. economy saw GDP shrink by 4%, the unemployment rate rise to 10.75%, and the stock market contract by 55%. In the end, the test showed the 23 largest banks could withstand $474 billion in losses from loans and other positions and still emerge with more than double the minimum required capital.

The results of this stress test are extremely important because last year, during the height of the pandemic, the Fed imposed restrictions on banks on capital distributions like dividends and buybacks in order to ensure banks would have enough capital to weather the storm. Given the clean bill of health, these restrictions have now been fully lifted, paving the way for banks across the board to raise dividends and ramp up stock buyback programs.

Looking ahead, market participants are gearing up for Q2 earnings season, which is expected to be a repeat of Q1 record-setting season, with earnings expected to continue being super-charged by stronger than expected demand from savings-loaden consumers and the continued reopening of the US economy thanks to effective distribution of the coronavirus vaccine. So far, analysts are looking for S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 61.9% year-on-year in aggregate, according to FactSet data – an estimate UBS's Head of Equity Derivatives Research Stuart Kaiser said may still be ""need to be revised higher.""

I don't believe that US shale is in a position to ramp up production to compete right now either as most cos are still delivering cash to shareholders (finally,) and I believe that before ramping up production they would like to see the current price of oil to stick around for more than 1 month before investing in higher output.

That being said, I believe higher prices will stick around for the summer and I don't believe OPEC will ramp up production until the end of summer when they have a clear sign that demand is here to stay. This makes sense to me logically, but it does leave out a lot of factors.

With EU coming back from the pandemic, maybe OPEC will be inclined to ramp up production to avoid oil prices that will compare to 2008-14. That would also cause US shale producers to react/invest quicker than most expect.

Oil prices are taking a dive today for sure, and I have actually bought calls today. I currently own Exxon, and I used to own Devon and Suncor, but I instead, sold the shares and bought ITM calls that are for next year that I plan on executing if the thesis stays the same. Oil is a swing trade, but I would like the opportunity to go long if I like what I see in 6 months. I do have price targets and also plan on selling majority of my oil trade at these price targets and evaluating if a long position would be worth it when the time comes. 

Today I purchased OXY calls for Jan 22, a new addition to my port.

I purchased MORE, Devon and Suncor calls. I did not buy more exxon calls today and actually instead trimmed my shares that I'm up on to diversify into the more leveraged names. I did not sell even 10% of my position though, I just wanted exposure and more leverage on my other names, as my Exxon position is very heavy, and I wanted to take advantage of the price action leading up to this OPEC meeting.","OPEC meeting Thursday, oil positions",1624907956

stocks,"What I’ve read ——Grupo Supervielle is one of Argentina's larger banking firms. Shares were trading for $30 as recently as 2018. However, the one-two punch of the recent Argentine economic meltdown and COVID-19 pandemic caused the stock to plummet to as low as $1.53 per share last year. The stock has rebounded to around $2.20 now and could have a lot of room to run. As it stands today, Supervielle is trading at just seven times trailing earnings, making this one of the cheapest stocks around both in terms of price and valuation. There is upside from a fundamental standpoint as well. Argentina is a large exporter of base metals such as copper. The price of these metals has soared this year thanks to the current inflationary wave. Furthermore, upcoming Argentine elections this fall could weaken the country's ruling left-wing party, offering a more constructive business climate for Argentine banks going forward.",Thoughts on Grupo Supervielle (SUPV),1624906244

stocks,"I wanted to give everybody a heads-up with one stock, ProventionBio, as I expect this to go up significantly this year due to the release of a new drug in July. 
 
ProventionBio (PRVB) is a pharmaceutical company whose target approach is to prevent the onset or progression of disease. They currently have no marketed drug, but have one drug in the pipeline to prevent disease progression of Type I Diabetes. This drug, teplizumab, is expected to be approved on July 2nd. It has already been incorporated into the American Diabetes Association guidelines to be given at early onset to prevent/delay progression into full-blown Type 1 diabetes.
 
Here’s why I think PRVB will be worth significantly more after the release of teplizumab. Type I Diabetes occurred in 1.4 million adults and 187,000 children in 2020 alone. If half of these people were given teplizumab which experts believe to be very high (50-100 thousand per treatment course), this will make the company lots of money. The company currently has a market cap of 580M. If the cost of treatment is $50,000 and only 250,000 patients received the dose, that is 12.5 billion per year. Studies are also showing that many more diabetic cases in adults are caused by Type 1, and not type 2 diabetes, meaning that the market for this drug is only going up. 
 
The stock is a steal right now, as there was a setback for PRVB a couple months ago. All data from the clinical trial shows teplizumab to work well at delaying T1D onset. However, absorption studies were not consistent due to using old technology from when PRVB bought teplizumab from Eli-Lily. The FDA said that their absorption and other pharmacokinetic data needs to be more consistent before it would be approved. The company needs to just use more modern approach to developing the drug to get consistent absorption of the drug, which is very doable as monoclonal antibody based drugs are extremely common these days. Once that is fixed, it should be approved as an FDA advisory committee already recommended approval in late May. This drug did receive a fast-track designation due to its potential impact on Type 1 Diabetes. 

ProventionBio also has other drugs in the pipeline for Celiac Disease (currently no treatment) and lupus. I have great faith in this stock going way up in the next few years!

stocks,"Hi everyone. I predict that GTA VI (made by Rockstar who are owned by Take Two) is going to absolutely dominate the multi billion pound gaming industry when it launches, maybe sometime early 2024. I think that any announcements about it are being purposefully delayed due to the fact that GTA V (8 years after launch) is still incredibly successful, having managed to generate nearly a billion dollars last year. 

If the new game embraces the ‘Battle Royale’ style of gameplay made popular by Fortnite, PUBG and COD like I think it will, then it’ll be targeting an even more lucrative market: Fortnite generated $5.5 billion in its first year. 

Then consider that hype significantly impacts certain areas of the market more than most as a new wave of poorly informed investors (like me) have entered the arena, and news of a release date will certainly generate a lot of positive movement when it comes...

Then consider that any further lockdowns are likely to increase spend on gaming...

stocks,"A couple of years ago I opened up an online brokerage account, and slowly started putting money into the account to play with the stock market a little bit with the intention of learning a little more about how the market works.  I was not playing with any large sum of money (it's all relative, but in my case after a couple of years of throwing money in I had about $1,500) as my real investments and retirement accounts are in much safer investments (mainly mutual funds).  The past few months I decided to give myself $1,000 of that account to essentially gamble in the market a little, buying and selling 1 or two stocks at a time every couple of days, using my 3 days trades most weeks, that sort of thing (no options or complex investments).

I have been trying to look into the tax side of things and (being typically a very cautious person) I just want to make sure I am not setting myself up for any tax issues at the end of the year if I keep playing with this account the way that I am.  I am sure I have run into the wash sale rule this year by buying and reselling the same stocks multiple times in the course of days or weeks.  I understand the basic concept of that rule, but not sure that I fully understand the tax implications.  I assume, at the end of the year, if I have essentially cashed-out that play account I would essentially just be paying the typical capital gains tax based on where I ended.  Is that correct?

Are you bullish or bearish on $AMC? Does not really matter and you can earn an extra yield on your position without risking any more dollars.  
  
How? Very simple.

* If you are bullish on $AMC, write (i.e. sell) out of the money calls with the exercise price where you liked to sell your position. If $AMC shoots up above the exercise price, you just cash out at the price you wanted to sell anyways. And if the stock does not reach the exercise price before the option expiration, you pocket a juice option premium.
* If you are bearish, write (i.e. sell) out of the money put options with the exercise price where you liked to close your position. As with above, if $AMC drops below exercise price your position gets closed out at the price you wanted anyways. And if $AMC share price does not reach the exercise price you pocket the whole option premium.

As AMC volatility skyrocketed, option premiums are staggering. One can easily find trades to earn 10% in a month. And then roll over again and again for the next few months.  
  
That's 120% annual IRR.  
  
Recently, we have [managed](https://www.specialsituationinvestments.com/2021/06/amc-entertainment-amc-options-trade-100-upside/) \+100% on selling $AMC options 3x out of the money. Crazy.

1. Contributions are not taxed because you already paid tax on them prior to putting them into the account.

2. When you sell a stock you only pay taxes on the capital gains and not on the contributions.

3. When you reinvest the capital gains(that you already paid taxes on when you sold) they are now considered contributions and not taxed again.

So if everything above is correct...would I be taxed once I finally withdraw the “entire balance” from the brokerage account? For example. Save money for 10 years, paid capital gains each year on sold stocks, finally withdraw it all and pay off my mortgage. I assume not but I don’t want to make a mistake.

I just wonder how the government keeps tract, do they only watch the capital gains?Because if I withdraw 150,000 in one year thats a lot if they tax it again.

Most recently, Square’s first-quarter results released last month saw revenues climb a staggering 266% year-over-year on sales of more than $5 billion. Of course, in 2020 Covid-19 was just hitting U.S. shores and folks everywhere were being introduced to lockdown orders. And to be sure, it’s a low base for making comparisons. But still, right? Right!

Just over a year ago when shares initially struggled off the market’s March 2020 bear market bottom, most pundits were reading SQ stock its last rites on worries the failure of the company’s important smaller merchant base would drag Square down with them. The reality turned out much differently. Cash App has been a large part of that success generating gross profits of nearly $500 million on growth of 171%. And now SQ appears to have a couple more aces up its sleeves.

As InvestorPlace’s resident growth maven Louis Navellier recently discussed, Square has committed itself to building a U.S.-based open-source, solar-powered Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD) mining facility. Along with the project reported to be a proof-of-concept effort, Square is looking to solve well-known challenges tied to Bitcoin’s egregious energy consumption and proof-of-work standard.

I have been down in my portfolio ever since then until today. 6 months. If you’re investing, forget about your portfolio. It doesn’t matter what it does this year or next year. Look at 10 years down the road. Are your picks fundamentally solid with good growth prospects? If so, forget about what price you bought.

stocks,"BROOKLYN, N.Y., June 28, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Etsy, Inc. (NASDAQ: ETSY), which operates two-sided online marketplaces that connect millions of passionate and creative buyers and sellers around the world, has signed a definitive agreement to acquire Elo7, a privately held marketplace for unique, handmade items, ranked as a top 10 ecommerce site in Brazil. Etsy will acquire the business for US$217 million in cash, subject to certain adjustments for Elo7's working capital, transaction expenses, cash and indebtedness, and reduced by the value of certain equity awards of Etsy to be granted to Elo7 employees in connection with the transaction. Following the closing of the transaction, Elo7 will continue to be headquartered in Sāo Paulo, Brazil and operate as a standalone marketplace run by its existing leadership team.

Considered a leader in 'custom and made-to-order' merchandise in Brazil with strong local brand awareness, the Elo7 marketplace connects approximately 1.9 million active buyers with approximately 56,000 active sellers and currently has approximately 8 million items for sale, the majority of which are made to order. Elo7's marketplace includes items from over 40 retail categories, with more than 50% of gross merchandise sales (GMS) from ""special event and life moment"" categories such as wedding, baby, home decor, and children's parties.

Josh Silverman, Etsy, Inc. CEO, commented, ""Elo7 is the 'Etsy of Brazil,' with a purpose and business model similar to our own. Following our recent agreement to purchase Depop, we're excited to bring another unique marketplace into the Etsy family. This transaction will establish a foothold for us in Latin America, an underpenetrated ecommerce region where Etsy currently does not have a meaningful customer base. We look forward to welcoming Elo7's talented leadership team and employees to the Etsy family.""

stocks,"Good morning everyone! I hope you had a nice weekend and were able to take some time to relax. 

*This list is geared towards day trading. With the momentum watchlist especially, I am typically in and out very quickly, only occasionally longer than a couple minutes, usually faster scalps.* Always have a plan when you enter a trade (for profit taking and for taking a loss), and use proper risk management for your account.

**Main Watchlist:**

Gapping UP:

* NTLA: Massive gap up, worth keeping an eye on for further movement. Possible premarket support at 135. 
* CRSP: Possible support around 150. I'll be watching how things look closer to open, but should be seeing high volume today.  
* SPCE: Worth keeping an eye on for further momentum after the big day on Friday. 
* LI: Potential resistance on the daily chart around 34. 
* AVXL: Seeing strong volume and price action in premarket, worth keeping an eye on for further momentum. Seeing lots of volatility, just make sure not to chase trades. 

Gapping DOWN:

* BA: Potential support level right around 245. Could retract to 240 if it drops below 244. 
* CCL:  Gapping down below SMA(50). Potential support level at 27. 
* MOXC: Could retrace down to the 16 level, particularly if it can't get back above 20. 

**Market Outlook:**

Stocks are looking at a mixed open, after finishing off last week on a strong note. SPY is trading a bit under 427, with the potential to set new ATH once again. DIA is trading right around 344, hovering right around that support/resistance level. Tech stocks are showing some strength, with QQQ trading a bit over 350. Gold, silver, and crude oil are all slightly down at the moment. EV stocks are somewhat mixed this morning. 

Some important news came out regarding CRISPR technology this weekend, so gene-editing stocks will be a hot topic today and likely throughout the week. Worth keeping an eye on NTLA, CRSP, BEAM, EDIT, etc.

Remember to use proper risk management, by making sure you size appropriately for your account and have a plan for every trade you enter (both for taking profits and cutting losses). Happy trading everyone :)","Morning Update for Monday, 06/28/21",1624884972

PHM is poised for success with the current housing shortage.  They have the reserve capital and access to cheap capital from their LOC that will allow them to accommodate the inevitable demand for more housing units.  

What differentiates residential construction from riets is that Riets seek to capitalized rising housing prices and charge higher rents to maximize profits.  Residential construction is creating value and in PHMs case, doing it in an affordable way while using durable materials and strategic locations.  

The housing shortage is a part of a bigger problem - too much demand.  A shortage leads to rising prices, and in the current economy, this will work both ways for PHM.  

They will sell homes for higher, their assets will appreciate, and they will benefit from building more homes for at least 3 years (inflation and interest rates will start getting sweaty in 2024).  For a short period of time, debt and capital obligations will rise but then revenue, net income, and balance sheet size will all increase.  This probably won’t increase margins because they already have competitive margins and CAPEX will be higher anyways.  

There are a number of alternatives to PHM, notably MDC which is extremely similar but about 1/4 the size of PHM.  Both will do before inflation becomes visible with rising rates, and there will be significant growth, probably 25% YOY.  

I have about 5k cash in my investments account and $500 in PHM.  I have 3600 in a margin account.  If you guys convince me, I’ll move my cash into my margin account and buy some long term calls.",PHM Due diligence,1624860317

In yet another blow to Boeing, the Federal Aviation Administration last month formally denied the jet maker permission to move forward with a key step in certifying its forthcoming giant widebody airplane, the 777X.

In a sternly worded letter dated May 13, which was reviewed by The Seattle Times, the FAA warned Boeing it may have to increase the number of test flights planned and that certification realistically is now more than two years out, probably in late 2023.

That could push the jet’s entry into commercial service into early 2024, four years later than originally planned.

The FAA cited a long litany of concerns, including a serious flight control incident during a test flight on Dec. 8, 2020, when the plane experienced an “uncommanded pitch event” — meaning the nose of the aircraft pitched abruptly up or down without input from the pilots.

Boeing has yet to satisfy the FAA that it has fully understood and corrected what went wrong that day.

The letter was signed by Ian Won, the manager of the local FAA office that judges whether Boeing has met all regulatory standards. He also told Boeing that a critical avionics system proposed for the airplane does not meet requirements.

And he expressed concern about proposed modifications involving late changes to both software and hardware in the electronics of the jet’s flight controls.

“The aircraft is not yet ready,” Won wrote. “The technical data required for type certification has not reached a point where it appears the aircraft type design is mature and can be expected to meet the applicable regulations.”

An FAA official, who asked not to be identified in order to speak freely, said the drag on 777X certification is now “the subject of a lot of attention” at high levels both within the agency and at Boeing.

Boeing’s last all-new jet, the 787, had to be grounded in 2013 when its batteries smoldered in flight. The next new plane, the derivative 737 MAX, was grounded for 21 months starting in 2019 after flawed new flight controls caused two fatal crashes.

Now the forthcoming 777X is having a troubled certification process. Is this just the FAA getting tough because of all the scrutiny?

The FAA official said that even if the MAX crashes hadn’t happened, the list of serious issues now raised about the 777X would merit rigorous regulatory attention.

Within the FAA, the person said, “there’s a general feeling that Boeing has kind of lost a step,” referring to the slide away from a historic reputation for engineering prowess.

And because of all the missteps, the official added, “the days of Boeing being able to say to the FAA ‘Just trust us’ are long gone.”

In a statement Friday, Boeing said it “remains fully focused on safety as our highest priority throughout 777X development.”

The airplane is undergoing “a comprehensive test program to demonstrate its safety and reliability … to ensure we meet all applicable requirements,” Boeing added.

The FAA in a statement said safety drives its decisions and timelines.

“The FAA will not approve any aircraft unless it meets our safety and certification standards,” the agency said.

FAA exasperated

Boeing launched the 777X at the Dubai Air Show in the fall of 2013, and at that time targeted 2020 as the year it would enter service.

Set to replace the Boeing 747 jumbo and Airbus A380 superjumbo passenger planes — which are no longer built — as the largest airliner in production, the 777X is a stretch version of the successful 777 passenger airliner featuring a new, superlong, carbon composite wing with folding tips and the largest jet engines ever built.

Boeing invested more than $1 billion in a new composites fabrication plant in Everett to build the wings.

Inside the main Everett assembly building, Boeing also installed state-of-the-art, automated stations to robotically assemble the wings — equipment designed by Mukilteo-based engineering company Electroimpact — and completely changed the way the 777 fuselage and wings come together to make assembly more flexible and efficient.

The first of two 777X models and the largest — the 777-9X, which carries 426 passengers in a two-class configuration — made its first flight in January 2020, kicking off the test flight program.

By now, four test planes are flying out of Boeing Field and at least 17 more 777Xs destined for customers Emirates, Lufthansa, Qatar Airways and All Nippon Airways have rolled out of the factory.

Boeing will have to park those production aircraft and any more built from now through at least late 2023 until certification allows their delivery.

The FAA’s letter on the status of 777X certification is addressed to Tom Galantowicz, the head of Boeing’s internal organization consisting of engineers and managers who act as proxies for the federal agency, tasked with testing and verifying that a new airplane design meets safety standards.

The letter denies Boeing a specific approval for the 777-9X called “Type Inspection Authorization” readiness. Without this, Boeing cannot put FAA personnel on board flight tests and begin to collect certification data.

The wording suggests a degree of exasperation with Boeing pushing for TIA when the FAA deems it far from ready.

“The FAA and Boeing have been discussing the TIA readiness of the Boeing Model 777-9 in numerous meetings over the past nine months,” the letter reads, adding that despite Boeing’s assertion that proceeding with TIA “warrants consideration,” the FAA in contrast “considers that the aircraft is not yet ready.”

The letter then lists a host of shortfalls in Boeing’s readiness.

FAA demands data, not promises

Asked about the test flight that experienced the “uncommanded pitch event” in December, Boeing said the plane went on to land safely and that engineers investigated the root cause and have developed a major software update to fix the problem.

In the meantime, until that’s approved, Boeing has given the test pilots instructions on how to avoid the incident recurring so that test flights can continue.

Yet the FAA clearly isn’t satisfied with Boeing’s promise of a software fix.

“After the uncommanded pitch event, the FAA is yet to see how Boeing fully implements all the corrective actions identified by the root cause investigation,” the letter reads.

“Software load dates are continuously sliding and the FAA needs better visibility into the causes of the delays,” it states.

To confirm “the maturity and safety/airworthiness of the aircraft,” the FAA demands comprehensive and documented reviews of the changes resulting from the investigation into the incident, to ensure that a similar problem “will not happen in the future and this is not a systemic issue.”

The FAA separately highlights concern over a critical piece of new avionics on the jet — the Common Core System, a set of shared computing resources critical to the functioning of multiple airplane systems.

Won notes that Galantowicz conceded in a letter to the FAA earlier in May that the CCS has incomplete software and does not meet TIA requirements.

Citing a “lack of data” and the absence of a Preliminary Safety Assessment for the FAA to review, the agency’s letter declares that Boeing hasn’t even met its own process requirements.

Boeing’s CCS “review dates have continuously slid over a year,” the letter notes.

In turning down the 777X for TIA readiness, the FAA also cited a finding that the supplier of the avionics provided “inadequate peer review” in a safety analysis “resulting in inconsistencies … and incorrect reuse of 787 data.”

GE Aviation’s plant in Grand Rapids, Michigan, supplies the CCS, which builds upon the similar common core avionics system it designed for the 787.

GE, which touts the CCS as the “central nervous system and brain” of the airplane, deferred comment to Boeing.

Demand for 777X currently near zero

Another problem for the FAA is Boeing’s proposal of late changes to the 777X flight control system.

“Boeing is proposing modifications that will involve firmware and hardware changes to the actuator controls electronics of the Flight Control System,” the FAA states. “Boeing needs to ensure the changes do not introduce new, inadvertent failures modes.”

Other pending modifications to the design of systems around the jet’s horizontal tail or stabilizer, which controls the pitch of the airplane, will change the crew alerts that flag certain system failures.

“Design maturity is in question as design changes are ongoing and potentially significant,” the letter states.

Separately, the letter states in passing that the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) has also “not yet agreed on a way forward” with regard to 777X certification.

In an emailed response Friday, EASA spokesperson Janet Northcote said the agency is “cooperating closely with the FAA” on 777X certification.

“We are looking closely at the technical files with the FAA and Boeing and this work is still ongoing,” she said.

The FAA’s letter told Boeing that because of the gaps in the 777X technical data, it anticipates a significant increase in the required level of testing and analysis, “and the potential to increase the number of certification flight tests that will need to take place.”

The letter concludes by requesting that Galantowicz’s unit “close these gaps” before submitting any further requests for TIA approval and that “based on the information from Boeing,” 777X certification is realistically more than two years out, in “mid to late 2023.”

Ironically, the only positive for Boeing in this situation is that — because of the pandemic’s destruction of international air travel demand — no airline in the world wants a 777X right now.

When international travel begins to pick up again post-pandemic, airlines will begin service with smaller jets like Boeing’s long-range 787 until long-haul air travel gradually returns to a level approaching what was typical in 2019.

Yet at a Bernstein Research industry conference this month, Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun doubled down on the 777X despite all the setbacks. Once the jet is certified, he said, “it will have a 40- or 50-year run, and I think it will be one of the great runs of all time.”

“I have lots of confidence in it,” Calhoun said. “We love it.”

Boeing’s website lists 320 orders for the 777X, though because of the delays airline customers will have the option to cancel some of those and may switch to smaller Boeing jets.

Dubai-based Emirates, the largest 777X customer, reduced its initial order for 150 aircraft to 115, swapping out 35 of the 777Xs for 30 much less expensive 787s.

The original 777 flight test program in the mid 1990s, from first flight to certification, took 10 months. For the 737 MAX, that period was just over 13 months. During the problem-ridden and much delayed development of the 787, first flight to certification took just over 20 months.

The 777X is currently set to reach certification almost four years after first flight.

Citing the delays in getting the plane certified, Emirates airline President Tim Clark has said he doesn’t expect any 777X deliveries until 2024.

Realistically, that’s the earliest any global carrier might want to take delivery of such a huge aircraft. Four years late, that’s when the 777X may finally be ready.","$BA — Citing a serious flight test incident and lack of design maturity, FAA slows Boeing 777X certification",1624849141

stocks,"Happy Sunday everyone, and thank you very much for giving a few minutes of your precious time to read this post. I will not bore you with tons of data on Rite Aid, symbol RAD but I will cut to many key points that are unbiased so you can make a decision. But I do want everyday traders to see many of the key points..

I have traded RAD quite alot in 2021, I am a day trader. Most recently I made some trades on Thursday and still have 1 block of shares at 17.45.

RAD in terms of footprint in the US is the 3rd largest pharmacy in the US. 1st is CVS, 2nd is Walgreens. At current date they have about 2,500 stores after making a cash purchase of Bartel for under 100 million for drug stores in WA. This chain in WA was already profitable so this was indeed a very good acquisition. 

In 2017 Walgreens purchased exactly 1,932 stores from RAD for 4.4 billion dollars in cash. At that time in 2017, RAD was bleeding cash..... RAD had atrocious cash flows, was losing tons of money and had roughly 8.5 billion in debt.. Walgreens had tried to buy RAD completely but the government was against this. The coupon bond on their loan was closer to 10%......... Now RAD 2,500 stores strong is valued at 900 million as of this writing. They have 3 billion in debt at 6% rate. This matters so that you can see the finances have gotten better, but even this debt with the market cap, the better performing stores has the CAP + DEBT at under 4 billion.....remember Walgreens purchased 1,932 stores for 4.4 billion in 2017.

The old CEO of RAD really did RAD in, believe it or not RAD was actually close to a 100 billion dollar company, the one that sits at 900 million now! Just check a chart. John Standley first took SAV On.... which went bankrupt. He often hires all his buddies and then the ship sinks...... He actually tried to get RAD to merge with Albertsons when Walgreens buy out failed. When the new CEO Heyward Donigan came aboard about 2 years ago, it gave me reason to take a look at RAD again. Onboard she was given a $530,00 salary with many types of bonuses, that will be important later but right now I am trying to focus on the turn around. At this time 6-7 quarters ago RAD was under $5 and I was happily trading it.. While she has been on board she has dropped the debt by 4-5 billion. The company is now profitable again. She has lowered the coupon bonds, made a large acquisition. A complete redesign. If you take a look at the last 6 quarters you will see where she has beat on the bottom line..... .ALL 6!!!  You would think the stock as well as her should be rewarded..

The past 2 quarters she has revised down guidance...... only to beat...... I am wondering if she is doing what we call ""Sandbagging"" not worried about the stock price for now, but making guidance easy to easily beat. I did some digging which took me time and I found her pay package as well as a breakdown when she joined in 2019. She made 8.3 million in bonus for 2020....... Unfortunately we do not know what the board votes for her to receive bonuses.....In 2019 she received onboard bonus for joining the team... It says in the SEC document that the board will vote each year to determine how/what she needs to do to achieve the bonus..... it could be the bottom line earnings which I am not sure... but if that is the case it make sense for her to lower guidance each quarter and beat easily. However, short term the stock will suffer.

In 2021 for full year the company is expecting revenues of 25+ billion and is expecting to lose about 20 million. Her lowered guidance for 2022 called for earnings before interest+taxes of 450 million.. Analysts had it at 500.... So outside of interest on the 3 billion and now a lower rate near 6% they are expected to make 450 million.... that sounds good to me! I believe they will come in higher but you can do your own research.

Finally, you must ask yourself, in the past 4 quarters is this company doing better now over last year? How were earnings? What do the financials say? Is this stock worth 16.50 = 900 million or more? Going forward do I feel it should be higher or lower? Do I have this confidence to buy now? Has the ship turned?

 Hello everyone, please see below my DD analysis on La-Z-Boy ($LZB). I would love to hear everyone's opinion.

**What Does La-Z-Boy Do?**

La-Z-Boy is one of the largest furniture manufactures in the United States. They are based in Monroe, Michigan, and they make home furniture, including upholstered recliners, sofas, stationary chairs, lift chairs, and sleeper sofas.

La-Z-Boy furniture is sold in thousands of retail residential outlets in the United States and Canada and is manufactured and distributed under license in other countries including the United Kingdom, Australia, Germany, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Turkey, and South Africa. La-Z-Boy holds US and international patents on more than 200 different styles and mechanisms. They employ approximately 9400 workers at this time.

La-Z-Boy Incorporated is divided into three reportable operating segments: the Upholstery Group, the Casegoods Group, and the Retail Group.

The Upholstery Group primarily manufactures and sells upholstered furniture to furniture retailers and proprietary stores. This includes recliners and motion furniture, sofas, lift chairs, loveseats, chairs, ottomans, and sleeper sofas.

The Casegoods Group primarily sells manufactured or imported wood furniture to furniture retailers, including tables, chairs, entertainment centers, headboards, dressers, accent pieces, and some coordinated upholstered furniture.

The Retail Group consists of 70 company-owned stores in the US. The Retail Group sells mainly upholstered furniture to end consumers through the retail network.

In July 2018 La-Z-Boy also acquired online furniture company Joybird for an undisclosed amount.

**The bull case**

* **Reason #1 - Oversold - It is trading well below fair value after being dumped over the past 2 days -** [Nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/an-intrinsic-calculation-for-la-z-boy-incorporated-nyse%3Alzb-suggests-its-21-undervalued) published an article 2 days ago saying the stock was trading 21% below value when it was trading at $42. Now it is at $36, the long-term support, which makes it approximately 33% below fair value. What is the reason for the selloff? In their earnings call, they issued a warning about a temporary negative impact to profit margins in the short term due to raw material price increases right now. However, they also said these issues will be offset by previously announced pricing actions as the company works through its immense backlog in the back half of the year. So basically, the selloff is an overreaction as their earnings report came out the same day Chairman Powell did his press conference and caused the whole market to dump.
* **Reason #2 - The stock will recover soon because it does this -** Because this stock has a relatively low market cap any negative news causes a dump that soon recovers. Simply looking at the chart over the past 6 months will show other such instances including the last major dump to this support level on February 1 and the subsequent recovery by 10%+ in only 8 days and a 20%+ recovery in just over a month after that.
* **Reason #3 - Never before seen boom in home furnishings -** Warren Shoulberg, a senior editor at Forbes, noted that LZB is the poster child for the boom in home furnishings sales. [r/investing](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/) does not allow linking to Forbes due to blog-style articles being published there so I will simply point out some salient points from the story -

&gt;If you want to know how real the boom in home furnishings sales is and how much America is spending to make their homes nicer, all you have to do is ask La-Z-Boy.By one measurement that the company uses, “written same-store sales” for the entire Galleries network doubled, increasing 100% for the quarter. For the year, those sales were up 31%.

Their CEO noted the following in the earnings call (also covered at Forbes) -

&gt;For the fiscal 2021 fourth quarter, record sales led to all-time record profits driven by increased production capacity, excellent performance by our company-owned La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries stores, and continued growth and profitability at Joybird.Fiscal 2022 is off to a great start with continued robust written order rates and a record backlog, setting us up well for a strong year of shipments ahead.

* **Reason #4** \- **LZB beat on all important metrics including EPS and revenue as per their June 15 earnings report** \- [**https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/LZB/earnings/**](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/LZB/earnings/)
* **Reason #5** \-**Despite LZB being an iconic furniture brand it is currently cheaper than the furniture industry average thanks to the recent selloff -** [**https://www.zacks.com/stock/chart/LZB/fundamental/pe-ratio-ttm**](https://www.zacks.com/stock/chart/LZB/fundamental/pe-ratio-ttm)
* **Reason #6 - Dividend-paying stock -** LZB suspended their dividend last year due to the pandemic but it has been reinstated as of this quarter. Part of the recent selloff was possibly also because the dividend was just paid this month. If they follow the same trend as they always have in years prior to COVID they should be expected to announce their next dividend in late August with dividend payment in early-mid September. Here is their dividend history-

[https://www.streetinsider.com/dividend\_history.php?q=lzb](https://www.streetinsider.com/dividend_history.php?q=lzb)

**The Bear Case**

* **Reason #1 - Continued global supply chain issues. Raw material prices skyrocket even higher -** The primary reason for the selloff appears to be management's warning about a temporary negative impact to profit margins in the short term due to raw material price increases. LZB's problems could be exacerbated if inflation continues to run hot and raw material prices skyrocket even higher.
* **Reason #2 - Suspension of dividends again -** LZB management suspended their dividend for 4 quarters due to Covid and only recently reinstated it last quarter. A major supply chain disruption or other internal issues could cause them to suspend it again.

**What are the transient factors that have affected the price of the stock?**

I am adding this section to clarify this point. I will quote directly from the earnings call which can be read in its entirety here-

[https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/06/16/la-z-boy-incorporated-lzb-q4-2021-earnings-call-tr/](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/06/16/la-z-boy-incorporated-lzb-q4-2021-earnings-call-tr/)

This is what caused the selloff-

&gt;Regarding production capacity, demand trends remained strong across the business with backlog at record levels, providing for a long tail. We anticipate ongoing incremental increases in capacity through fiscal 2022 as new assembly cells are added and efficiencies improve, which will result in continued incremental progress on delivered sales. However, we expect temporary significant pressures on profit margins in the first half of fiscal '22 compared to the very strong profit margin of this Q4. We expect to face ongoing global supply chain disruptions and escalating raw material and freight costs, which will cause volatility in results and will eventually be offset by our already announced pricing actions in the back half of the year as we work through our backlog.

Analysts clarified this point further during the call:

&gt;**Bobby Griffin** \-- *Raymond James &amp; Associates, Inc. -- Analyst*  
So Bob, I just want to circle right back quickly to your comments about the 300 bps of margin pressure just to make sure we're all on the same page of what's that referencing in kind of what timeframe. So is that in reference to the 10% EBIT margin that was posted in 4Q? And are you saying that 1Q and 2Q of 2021 should be down about 300 bps at the highest level possible versus first at 10% if raw material headwinds were as strong as they could be?  
**Robert Lucian** \-- *Chief Financial Officer*  
That's correct.  
**Bobby Griffin** \-- *Raymond James &amp; Associates, Inc. -- Analyst*  
Okay. And then -- so for both quarters kind of the same type of trajectory off the 10%. I mean, that would put 2Q though below where kind of it was in the October of '19 quarter which was 7.5%. Is that all just raw material related or mix of business or could we end up at 7% EBIT margins below than kind of where we were two years ago even?  
**Robert Lucian** \-- *Chief Financial Officer*  
It's mostly the raw material impacts that we're seeing. And again, we've taken pricing and it's taking a while for that pricing to work its way through. So it will work its way through by toward the end of Q2 into Q3 and that's when our margins will start improving.  
**Bobby Griffin** \-- *Raymond James &amp; Associates, Inc. -- Analyst*  
Okay. All right, that's helpful. And then trying to -- usually 1Q is the seasonally weak quarter, but with this large of a backlog that you have, I think in the 10-K it was $617 million or something called out. I mean, is the right way to think about the potential revenue side of things here in 1Q basically 12, 13 of what you delivered in 4Q or is there something wrong with kind of using that as an estimate?  
**Robert Lucian** \-- *Chief Financial Officer*  
I don't think there's anything wrong using that as an estimate.

As such, their margins may be lower this quarter if raw material prices continue to be as high as they've been but they've already taken actions that will cause this pressure to lift by the end of Q2 going into Q3 and while margins may be lower the actual revenue and profits will again beat records thanks to the immense backlog in orders that they're now fulfilling thanks to the additional capacity they have added.

**Financials &amp; Valuation**

LZB balance sheet can be viewed at [https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/quote/LZB/balance-sheet?p=LZB](https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/quote/LZB/balance-sheet?p=LZB) for reference to what I state below.

* LZB is a profitable business with a consistent adjusted EBITDA margin of around 10% which is in line with industry standards -[https://csimarket.com/Industry/industry\_Profitability\_Ratios.php?ind=407](https://csimarket.com/Industry/industry_Profitability_Ratios.php?ind=407)
* Debt-free - LZB is debt-free.
* Short-term assets ($926.2M) exceed short-term liabilities ($611.7M).
* Short-term assets ($926.2M) exceed long-term liabilities ($392.5M).
* Regarding valuation, I have already covered this in the bull case where LZB is now nearly 33% undervalued as per the [Nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/an-intrinsic-calculation-for-la-z-boy-incorporated-nyse%3Alzb-suggests-its-21-undervalued) calculation. The Nasdaq story only says 21% because it was published when the stock price was still $42 and it is now trading around $36.

Based on all this I believe LZB is a great business and iconic brand that is currently trading well below fair value. I believe this represents a great investment opportunity.

**TL;DR:** LZB stock faced a selloff this week because management warned that record high raw material prices would affect their bottom line in the short term. Management also noted that these issues will be offset by previously announced pricing actions as the company works through its immense backlog in the back half of the year. Considering this, I believe the stock is oversold as it is considered as much as 33% undervalued as per [Nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/an-intrinsic-calculation-for-la-z-boy-incorporated-nyse%3Alzb-suggests-its-21-undervalued) at current prices which represents a great investment opportunity.",LZB (La-Z-Boy Inc.)

stocks,"While this strategy has its own pros and cons I am wondering if people use it and if so, what has been their experience and how they feel about it compared to other strategies.

What I like about it is that you get to stay liquid all the time and don't need to hold anything overnight + since you are going in heavy the returns must be good enough compared to what you would have made if you had just put in 5% of your money.

And obviously the cons being if you accidentally catch the top or if anything goes south right around the entry price, you stop out with a loss.

Since I haven't tried this strategy myself, I am sure I might be missing a lot of things which is why I am interested to know what has and what hasn't worked for those who have gone down this route. TIA.

Also I am referring to large cap stocks, not penny stocks. E.g. if PTON has a 5% day, you day trade it and catch like 3-4% on the way up and get out end of day.

Rather than spending money on something frivolous I decided to make my first investment with the rest of it. I remembered that article and invested 350$ in ETF.   
I decided to keep the rest as play money and traded with some insights from this qooore app attempting to double this sum. I received decent returns sometimes over 50% per week (please, do not follow my advice blindly, this is still risky).

\- The recent Supreme Court Case did not *look* good for Fannie Mae with regards to the lawsuit.

\- The case however did seem to be instrumental in the independence away from the US Government.

But, for FNMA to succeed, the US Government would have to bring it out of conservatorship?

stocks,"Another post on here was questioning general investment strategy and this brought the question of property into the equation, and it prompted me to get your views on this…

Property can be a great investment generating both capital growth and income. But it’s a pain in the arse. I’m in a senior position in a fairly substantial private property investment company, but I have no interest in owning buy to let property, despite doing this for living.

I suspect people do it because they can put down a relatively small deposit, mortgage finance the remainder, acquire a substantial asset and watch it grow, whilst also paying an income.

My question is, why not do the same with equities?

Assuming I only invest in equities with a margin requirement of 25% then I can have a portfolio 4 x larger than I could otherwise have, and at a fairly low rate of interest, a rate comparable to buy to let mortgage rates.

Im mid thirties, have about £280k ($389k) free cash at the moment and most is invested in equities. I earn a decent salary and live fairly modestly, so a good chunk of future earnings can also be saved or invested. No large future expenses anticipated. Own my house in London (albeit with mortgage).

So why not treat equities like property, leverage it, and profit in the long run in a much more liquid market, with lower costs and less hassle than property.

Obviously everyone’s personally circumstances are different but I could definitely tie this money up for 10 years so what good reasons are there not to do this.

I have a larger pension from a previous job that I would like to invest long term in world ETFs. I would like my investment to be based on the ESG standards (ex China). I have 30+ years until retirement.

I currently see two options:

1. An easy solution where I pick a Developed markets ETF and an Emerging markets ETF (ex China) \~ 0.2 APR.
2. Construct the Developed markets part from four regional ETFs (USA, Europe, Japan, Pacific ex Japan) and again add Emerging markets \~ 0.1 APR.

A minor issue with option 2 is that Pacific ex Japan doesn't exist as ESG from iShares (where I intend to buy most of my portfolio), but it's only 4% of the market. I also haven't found the Emerging markets ex China as ESG.

Covering Developed markets with regional ETFs would save about 0,1% per annum, but I'm not sure it's worth the hassle. If, at some point, I have to sell part of my investment to pay my taxes from the earnings, or I want to change course a bit, then the allocation will either be skewed, or I'll have to pay extra in brokerage fees to keep the correct allocation between the regional ETFs.

I know some people also advocate for simple portfolios.

Replay VideoMore Viddeos

Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey (R) announced Tuesday that her state has landed the first graphite processing plant in the U.S.

In a statement, Ivey said Alabama reached an agreement with Westwater Resources Inc., a Colorado-based mineral resources company, to build a plant in Coosa County.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Westwater Resources subsidiary Alabama Graphite Products LLC plans to invest $80 million to help build the first plant in Kellyton, near Alexander City, and a second phase of the project will push the total investment to $124 million.

The construction will start later this year and is slated to be operational by the end of 2022. The the goal of the plant is to produce 7,500 tons of battery-grade graphite each year, according to the statement.

“This plant not only will make Alabama the U.S. leader in graphite production, the go-to place for this important resource in battery manufacturing, it also will elevate our standing even more as a major player in the fast-growing electric vehicle sector,” Ivey said in the statement.

“We’re home to four major auto plants, and the ability to source precious materials in state for the lithium-ion batteries used in electric and hybrid vehicles will be a big plus in attracting other manufacturing jobs to the state.”

\- Enjoy years of superior online privacy with nearly $200 off this VPN...

Westwater Resources CEO Chris Jones said that he’s thankful for Ivey's and other state officials' help on the project. “We look forward to being an active member of the business community here for many years to come,” Jones said. 

The new graphite plant will create 100 full-time jobs and with hourly wages up to $21.25 an hour.

Vanguard and Bogle are pioneers in finance and have helped more Americans achieve capital growth and social mobility than any government program could ever dream of. However this post is about the ridiculous circlejerk and cult-like behavior that has stemmed from it.  

So there is a thread right now with a guy asking how to generate income with six figures in cash he has. The entire thread is this: 

""Throw it in VTI and call it a day"" 

""Buy an index fund and hold. Don't look for the needle, buy the haystack!"" 

""SPY and VOO"" 

""PLTR 0DTE Calls!"" 

""I have an aggressive portfolio"" - *has a quarter of their portfolio in government bonds and the rest in VTI* 

So while all of this is good and dandy for investment advice, the ridiculous amount of Boglehead anti-risk circlejerking is getting on my nerves. We get it, you figured out the keys to the kingdom - except that has nothing to do with the topic at hand. OP wasn't asking about how to make a retirement fund. He was asking how to generate income which is a completely separate objective from what passive investing is. The right response would be something like a covered call strategy or a high dividend yield investment, not a ""set it and forget it"" portfolio from Vanguard. 

Bogleheads in recent times have become the financial equivalent to Jehova's witness - going door to door about how the world is going to end and how all the stock pickers are peasants who will face the wrath of god when the rapture occurs. 

If you don't want to actively pick stocks, thats ok. Nobody is forcing you too. But please stop telling everyone else that they should do the same. Everyone has a different risk profile and given the amount of teens and 20 years olds on here, their risk tolerance far exceeds anything propogated by the three funds portfolio, and they still have the time to take advantage of that fact. 

This subreddit and every other sub about investing are naturally oriented towards actively managed portfolios. We discuss interesting companies, investment philosophies, and all the ways to manage a hands-on approach to portfolio management. This conversation is the antithesis of passive investment because with passive investing, all you do is buy some funds and that's it - no more discussion. Nothing else is necessary because the philosophy of passive investing is ""set it and forget it"" except Bogleheads forgot the second part, and they want everyone else to do the same apparently.",Rant about Bogleheads,1624820221

stocks,"I saw a question on this sub yesterday about why stocks are valuable, so I thought I would do a write-up of what I learned about stocks in business school. But first, an important concept:

# The Time Value of Money, Present Value, and Discount Rate

**A loan to a friend**

Imagine if you loaned someone $1000 for a year. You probably want to be paid back with interest. This interest compensates you for losing access to that money for a year, during which you could have deposited it at a bank, invested it, or even spent it.

The long story short is that $1000 today is worth more than $1000 tomorrow because of the flexibility and options that you have with today's money. We can say that the ***Present Value*** of $1000 next year is less than $1000 today. This concept is also known as ***The Time Value of Money.***

**An Example With T-Bills**

Treasury bills (T-Bills) are essentially loans to the US Government, but the amount to be repaid is fixed. T-Bills are typically denominated in $1000s, which is the amount the government will repay when the bond matures. 

An investor can typically buy a T-Bill for less than the full $1000 on the open market. The investor makes money because she purchased the future $1000 payment at a ***discount.*** This discount exists because money today is worth more than money tomorrow. How do you convert between the two? Using the appropriately named ***Discount Rate***, or the required rate of return. 

The average investor wants to make money from lending money, even to the US Government. If investors want a 1% return, then $100 today is the same as $101 next year.

We can similarly price T-Bills: If the required rate of return is 1%, and the bond will pay $1000 in a year, then the ***Present Value*** of the T-Bill is about $990. This is because the $990 investment will grow by 1% into $1000.

***--------------------------------------------------------***

Are you still awake? Good. This is the fun part.

# So What Are Stocks Anyway?

Stocks represent partial ownership of a company. A company is divided into units of stock called shares, and as a shareholder, you are entitled to a fraction of the company's assets (after all debts are repaid) and any future profits.

**So Why Does a Stock Have Value?**

Part of a stock's value comes from its book value (the value of all company assets minus all company debt) but this clearly only a small fraction of that price ( the average price-to-book ratio for the companies in the S&amp;P500 is about 4.5). ***The remainder of the stock value comes from the future earnings of a company.***

Similar to how the price of a T-Bill is the present value of a future payment, a large part of a stock's value comes from the present value of future earnings. Analysts will project (and discount) a company's future earnings, add the book value, and arrive at an estimate of the stock's value.

# Oversimplified DCF Example:

The Pear Company makes $100 a year risk-free. For simplicity's sake, it has $200 in assets and no debt. Your local bank is offering to double your money in your savings accounts every year, so you figure 100% is a good discount rate to use.

The Pear Company will make $100 next year (Year 1), which is worth $50 today ($50 doubles into $100 at the bank in a year). In Year 2, The Pear Company's earnings are only worth $25 to you today, and so on. If you add the present value of all future cash flows together, you'll arrive at $100. 

You can find the company value by adding the value of its assets ($200) with the present value of its future earnings ($100).  If Pear issues 100 shares, each will be worth $3.

[Of course, even simple DCF Models IRL look a little scarier than the above example.](https://imgur.com/a/DzMQHHT)

# But What Makes The Stock Valuable To Me?

You might have noticed that dividends aren't really taken into account at all. How are you supposed to get any real money from a company whose stock pays no dividends?

Unpaid dividends don't just disappear. Management can decide to reinvest these profits to grow their income. This results in a larger stock price over time. The company might also just decide to keep the cash on its balance sheet. This results in a larger book value, and the stock price will increase to reflect that.

You can sell some stock to create your own ""dividend"" if you'd like; you will own a smaller percentage of the company, but because profits were not distributed to shareholders, the company has gotten bigger.

**But What Makes The Stock Valuable To The Next Guy?**

Eventually, the company's value will be returned to shareholders. This could happen in several ways:

1. Dividends are paid out in the future, returning capital to investors
2. The company is acquired or goes private, and shareholders either receive cash or stock in the acquiring company. Typically, the acquisition price is determined by, among other things, the present value of all future earnings of the company,
3. The company might also just decide to stop operating and liquidate its assets. Shareholders will receive all assets the company owns (after paying its debt).",How Stocks Are Valued Part 1: Discounted Cash Flow,1624805214

stocks,"**Overview**

WISH controls the most popular shopping mobile application in the world. In short, the company is a direct-to-consumer online retailer. However, a few key features differentiate it from its competition:

* WISH does not operate any brick-and-mortar locations
* WISH does not target popular branded items in its offerings
* WISH oftentimes works directly with the manufacturers or independent sellers instead of the wholesaler

Let’s go through this list to understand why this is a significant differentiation. 

* WISH not operating any brick-and-mortar locations allows it to maintain low capital expenditures (CAPEX) and frees up its cash flows.
* WISH’s focus on unbranded items allows it to compete in a more niche market that has not been taken over by other e-commerce giants. This is a space that WISH dominates. 
* WISH’s decision to work directly with manufacturers rather than wholesalers allows it to procure its product catalog at a much cheaper price point than any competitor which it then passes on to its customers. With independent sellers, WISH offers a more unique product catalog than its competitors.

These three features combined defines how it interacts with its customer base. WISH targets mostly younger, low to middle income households. It offers cheap and unbranded products, an area that was historically ignored by larger e-commerce companies. Even their strategy to be a mobile app reflects this. According to Pew Research, lower-income shoppers accessed the internet solely through their smartphone at a rate double the other income brackets.

**The Future of E-commerce is Mobile**

E-commerce is not a new term. Years ago, a CEO at Sears might have argued that people prefer an in-store experience. Today, that same CEO would finally admit that he was incorrect in underestimating the prominence of e-commerce. However, what most people do not know is that e-commerce is still in its growth phase. Although due to COVID, 2021 represented one of the highest growth years ever for e-commerce. Its growth in Q1 2020 over tripled the growth in Q3 and Q4 of 2019. In 2020, online spending represented 21% of the total retail sales while in 2019, online spending represented only 16%.

Furthermore, the growth is mostly being captured by the American and European markets. This is especially useful for WISH as over 80% of its global sales is coming from these two regions.

A few macro trends are expected to drive e-commerce for the next decade:

* Mobile shopping: COVID-19 accelerated the shift to online shopping by over 5 years! Mobile commerce or m-commerce is expected to continue breaking out over the next few years, rising at a rate of 25.5% compounded annual growth rate. Its expected that by 2024, m-commerce will represent 44% of all e-commerce transactions accounting for \~$500B in sales.
* Big data and AI: A key advantage in e-commerce is going to be in data whether that is to power a recommendation feature or to power targeted advertisements, data is the new gold for e-commerce companies. Increasingly, the ability to personalize the shopping experience per user is becoming a crucial differentiator. BCG reports that proper personalization can increase sales by over 25%.

**WISH, More than Just a Retailer**

WISH has a few main product lines:

* Online retail store, the Wish mobile application
* ProductBoost, a marketing service on the Wish mobile application
* WishLocal, a digital presence service for smaller brick-and-mortar retailers
* Wish Express, a logistics service for customer delivery

**1. WISH as an online retail store**

As an online retail store, WISH is growing quickly in all areas. As of 2021, its revenue per active user increased 76% YOY, led by an increase in orders over $20 which increased over 50% in Q1 2021. However, total monthly active users declined 7% YOY which may indicate some saturation in their market.

As stated before, the key differentiator in the future of online retail is going to be personalization through big data and AI. WISH is uniquely positioned to capture this core advantage. At its very inception, WISH has always recognized the value of data. As of 2020, WISH catalogued the following data points:

* 100M+ monthly active users: their age, gender, location, etc.
* 150M+ activities on Wish: clicks, scrolls, items sold, etc.
* 500K+ merchant data: refund rates, ship times, etc.
* 640M+ items shipped: ratings, pictures, etc.

Through this enormous warehouse of data, WISH was able to build one of the most effective recommendation engines in the world. WISH sees **70%** of their sales coming from purchases not involved with a search query. This speaks volume on the effectiveness of their data science platform and their ability to understand their customer, which in turn enables…

**2. ProductBoost, the AdWords for Shopping**

By proving out a deep knowledge of their customer base, WISH can show relevant targeted ads to its user-base. In 2020, 30% of all merchants on WISH used this service to increase their sales which represented $140M of revenue for WISH. The company is very focused in growing this area as it represents a scalable, high-margin service offering for them. As of Q1 of 2021, they are already seeing a 14% increase in sales in this area compared to Q4 of 2019. 

**3. WishLocal, Helping those Behind the Curve**

WishLocal is a service that brick-and-mortar retailers sign up for. Through WishLocal, they agree to become a drop point for WISH products in return for a fee. They will both earn the fee as well as can cross-sell to the customer. This also serves as an incentive point for them to sign onto Wish as a merchant. While WishLocal is not a revenue generating feature, it is a point of differentiation that allows Wish to have a physical presence without the need for heavy investment in brick-and-mortar stores.

**4. Wish Express, Driving Business Forward**

Wish Express is the global logistics service at WISH. They contract out other delivery services from local vendors and stitch it all together into a single product. Like this, they can both improve their own delivery services (shipping-related refunds were down 40+% in 2021) as well as to offer another revenue generating service to their merchants and partners. In 2021, their logistics revenue was \~$250M which represented a 338% increase from the previous year.

**Strong Balance Sheet, Weak Income Statement**

WISH is a risky company, and this is reflected in their finances. They have a cash reserve of $2B which is balanced out with nearly $900M in current liabilities. In 2020, they issued $1B in new stock whose funds were used to absorb a $750M net operating loss. This represents a major risk for the company as an operating loss of this magnitude will not be sustainable for more than 2 years.

The $750M operating loss was mostly made up of an extremely high marketing expense and a reduction in their gross margins. The SG&amp;A (primarily driven by marketing) expense went up by 40% which corresponds to a 33% increase in sales indicating an inefficient usage of resources.

While the marketing expense can be easily controlled, it’s a little worrisome to see their gross margins reduced from 80% in 2019 to 64% in 2020 especially as they have a long-term goal of 75% margins. If WISH cannot get their margins back and maintains current levels of spending, another share dilution will be necessary next year as well to sustain its balance sheet health.

In 2020 WISH did 2.54 billion in revenue, a 33.7% increase from 2019 revenues. Their trailing twelve month (TTM) gross margin is roughly 60%, which is very good for the e-commerce industry where it is usually closer to the 40% range. Like mentioned above, WISH's SG&amp;A expense is absolutely huge and one of the main factors of why they are burning through cash. 

In their most recent earnings report, WISH management guided revenues of 715-730 million revenue for Q2 2021. What’s concerning is that it’s only 2-4% growth when looking YoY, however, management noted that this is mainly due to the incredible growth they experience the year prior as lockdowns became normalized around the world. This ties back to the debate of whether or not their target market is seeing saturation.

**The Bottom Line**

In many ways, WISH reminds me of an early Amazon. Perhaps their story will end similarly to Amazon as well where they become a global tech giant valued well past where they were as an online retail store. After all, they have many things going for them:

* The most downloaded shopping app in the world
* High market share in the niche unbranded sales space
* Expansion into high margin services

However, there are some warning signs to recognize as to how WISH may not be the next Amazon.

* Amazon already exists and it competes against WISH
* It lost monthly active users in the year it spent the most in marketing
* Its gross margins declined in 2020 (though its been steadily rising beforehand)

For me, I see a company with $1B of extra cash above its current liabilities and revenues of $2B being valued at $8.5B. I believe the $8.5B valuation reflects the risk that WISH incurs burning through $750M of cash in a year (it only happened once, 2019 was much better). If WISH can figure out a way to stem the bleeding of cash or to raise funds without a share dilution, their stock price should rise as a result.

With their focus on data, their considerable market share, and some core high margin products already underway, I believe that WISH is poised for growth in 2021.

**TLDR;**

1. WISH is in the e-commerce space and they are what I would call a ""flea market in your pocket"" that gives you access to thousands of products directly from their mobile app. They do not operate brick and mortar locations, and they do not target branded items which allows them to work directly with manufacturers instead of wholesalers (cutting out the middle man and saving on expenses).
2. WISH is able to dominate this very niche space because the big e-commerce players simply do not care about selling discount items of this type. WISH's customer-base is targeted toward the low-to-middle class which is evident if you go to their site. Many products are under $5 and in unusual categories to say the least.
3. One advantage in WISH's business model is the fact that they create a bridge between the customer and the manufacturer, cutting out the middle-man while maintaining low capital expenditures (CapEx), which free's up their cash flow to spend on things like customer acquisition.
4. When it comes to their fundamentals WISH is a ""risky"" company. They aren't overly indebted, but still hold roughly 900m liabilities compared to their 2B cash reserve. Most of their expenses are marketing expenses and they burn through a significant amount of money on customer acquisition. This might present the risk of new share issuance and dilution should the stock price out-perform in a short period of time.
5. Having said all that, their gross margin (\~60%) is quite healthy. For a company that trades at only 3x sales they have the potential to out-perform the market should they figure out a way to retain customers without spending billions on SG&amp;A expenses. In short, they are doing just under 3 billion in sales and have a market cap of 8.7 billion dollars.

stocks,"I don't mean the stock's price, I mean the company itself. I keep seeing people saying that short sellers bankrupt companies, but, to my understanding, the only way that they affect the company is through lowering the share price. A lower share price means that the company can raise less money through additional share offerings, but... That's about it, right? 

I also guess it affects more of the intangible aspects like investor confidence and so on, but I still fail to see exactly how short sellers affect the company.

If the company is good enough, eventually it will bounce back up, right? There's a reason why the most shorted companies are some of the most controversial ones. Most of the them have slim chances of performing well or are overvalued.

And, also, if we apply the reverse logic, if a company's share price gets pumped up and kept up, the only thing they can do is raise more money through the shares. However, if their management and business is shit, they're just buying themselves more time before bankruptcy, right?

I've seen the theories about companies that are trading above the fair value actually creating value through share offerings, but at the end of the day it comes down to the underlying business and it's performance. If a company was that good that it only needs money to become an amazing performer, there surely would be some merry bunch of individuals who would give them some. I mean, investors and institutions are spending a fuckton of money supporting companies with a 10% chance of surviving over the next few years and dodgy startups, if they saw a company that only needs cash to perform well, they'd surely recognise the opportunity, right?

I have not actually done any substantial factual research on this although admittedly it's a bit hard to find good resources right now which are not biased.

Relatively  new to investing doing it for half year but the more i get into it the  less i understand. So why is it so important for some companies to pay  and constantly increase dividends year by year.

As  far as i understand companies need money at the beginning of their life  to cover the expenses and then in exchange they return the profit to  the investors in dividends or buybacks which makes the stock/company  valuable which drives the stock price up so they can issue more shares  if they need money for further investment.

So  this is completely ok but a company like coca-cola, altria, 3m etc.  doesnt really issue any new shares or do something innovative to reform  the company/build factories etc. So does it even matter what their stock  price is? Their net profit would cover all expenses isnt it?

stocks,"What I like about Lightning eMotors (ZEV) is that they dominate a niche space that stands to grow very quickly. Rather than focusing on ""last-mile” lighter-duty vehicles, which would compete with high volume manufacturers, they use a medium-duty legacy chassis to take advantage of existing “upfit ecosystems” that  class 3-7 fleet commercial fleets actively depend on. This means easy electrification of ambulances, street cleaners, refrigerator trucks, and lifts as well as universal access to easily sourced spare parts for critical maintenance. 

While preserving fleet owners' capital investments, their legacy chassis strategy also gives them a first mover advantage by clearing them of all federal and state safety certifications, thus removing a major time and logistics obstacle.  This is why Lightning eMotors already has over 50% marketshare. 

Because the vehicles are designed for long lifespan and they are expensive to modify, fleet operators commonly change out drive trains rather than buy new vehicles. Now, because of sound economics and government mandates, instead of a new diesel drive train, they are moving to electric. This growing demand is why ZEV is dramatically expanding its Colorado-based facility and is expected to grow 195% CAGR over the next 4 years. 

Overview of some key points:

* First mover advantage — They’ve shipped more than 3x biggest competitor and currently control more than 50% market share in class 3-7 EV.
* Quarterly YoY revenue growth: 560%
* 2021 projected revenue is 100% contracted with pipeline of $800 million in sales
* Zero Debt and Low Capex assembly of vehicles 
* Projected 195% CAGR with $2 billion revenue by 2025 driven by government and corporate mandates to electrify commercial fleets.  That kind of revenue relative to their current $662 million market cap offers a sense of the value proposition, especially with a $67 billion TAM
* As the largest US-owned medium-duty commercial EV company, Lightning eMotors they will uniquely benefit from Biden's recently announced plan to replace entire government vehicle fleet with electric vehicles under the “Buy America” mandate.  The Biden White House says, ""Biden’s order directs federal agencies to purchase zero-emission power and automobiles, such as electric vehicles, as a way to “leverage the federal government’s footprint and buying power to lead by example.”  
* Medium-duty portion of Federal fleet electrification plan is 110,000 vehicles that only Lightning eMotors is currently equipped to handle. This represent a 5x of their entire 2025 projected revenue of $2 billion.  CEO Tim Reeser says they are currently working with USGSA on this new development.
* ZEV already sell to 30 fleets representing 500,000 vehicles and has strategic partnerships and contracts with DHL Express, Amazon, USPS, IKEA, Ford, Shyft, Plug Power, Proterra, BP, Romeo Power, ABC, Borg Warner, Winnebago, and the State of California.  DHL Express is expected to deploy their vehicles in California and New York later this year.
* Use of legacy chassis takes advantage of existing fed and state certifications along with entire medium-duty upfit ecosystem (ambulance, lifts, chillers and spare parts),which is critical for fleet owners. 
* ZEV can build from ground up or re-power drivetrains of existing fleets. Re-powering is most common in this medium-duty class designed for long mileage.  This enables fleet owners to continue using already customized vehicles thus extend the value of significant capital investment.
* Proprietary scalable analytics and proven operational savings for fleet customers.
* Offers fleet financing and patented mobile charging technologies and charging as a service (CAAS) which they are expanding to commercial and government fleets via its Lightning Energy division.
* Large patent portfolio
* Lightning eMotors has the largest commercial electric production facility in the US. Moreover, they are currently doubling their work force and quadrupling their Colorado-based manufacturing facility to meet accelerating demand. “Combined, the expansion and new equipment ensures that we’re ready for continually increasing demand and the growth of the business.”  Expansion plans are fully funded with no need of debt and they’ve signed leased to allow further 5x or more expansion. (1 million square foot campus)
* Oppenheimer analyst team are bullish with a $15 PT (80% upside) using a discounted to peer 6x sales multiple and their more conservative 169% CAGR estimate: “With Lightning's diverse supply chain, demonstrated capability in delivering numerous vehicles types, and optionality on either growing through powertrain development, full vehicle sales, or being a leading integrator of fuel cell-based power systems, we believe ZEV shares offer investors meaningful upside potential.""

Quotes from clients:

“We looked at every brand of commercial EV and vehicle analytics out there, and after intense research, we chose to partner with Lightning eMotors.We require the highest tech vehicles to integrate with our online rental platform, and Lightning’s technology fits us well. We are able to show a compelling return on investment for these vehicles versus their legacy gasoline vehicles for our rental customers.”

–U.S. Fleet Operator

“We have chosen to partner with Lightning to help us achieve our aggressive worldwide sustainability goals. We have started our journey of procuring 1,000’s of zero emission trucks worldwide over the next 5 years and expect that Lightning will be a key supplier for vehicles and charging infrastructure.”

stocks,"One of the top gainers of the past week was Grove Inc. (GRVI) which IPO'd on Thursday. I did a quick financial analysis of the company and would love to get your thoughts.  

Grove is a fully integrated provider of CBD products, meaning they manufacture products in-house, have their own brands as well as provide white label services, and operate their own marketplace. 

[Grove's financial snapshot](https://imgur.com/nLMI8Ya) - honestly they look really impressive for a company of this size, and make me think that the company is undervalued at these prices. All information is taken from the company's [investor presentation](https://groveinc.io/investor-relations/investing-deck/), the [S-1 filing](https://sec.report/Document/0001477932-21-003754/), and [IPO prospectus](https://sec.report/Document/0001477932-21-004256/grove_424b4.htm)

**Some of my key takeaways after going through the financials:**  

* Rapid revenue growth: Grove did $13.4M in revenue in the 9 months ended March 2021, growing from $5.1M in the prior year period (163% growth rate). This growth comes even in a year where Grove was not able to hold any trade shows due to COVID, which have historically brought in over $1M in revenue and are likely to be a big potential driver of growth as the industry increases in popularity
  
* Attractive gross margins: Even at small scale, the company managed 50.5% gross margin in the 2021 9M period, improving from 31.4% in the prior year period. 50%+ gross margin is a great achievement, especially for a smaller company without significant scale advantages, and speaks to the benefits of Grove's fully verticalized approach as well as the profit potential of the CBD market. Gross profit grew 314% YoY driven by a combination the revenue growth and margin expansion
  
* Improving net profitability: In 2021, Grove managed to achieve positive Net Income and Operating Cash Flow. In the 9M period ending March 2021, the company did $260K of Net Income and positive Operating Cash Flow of $98K. This compares to a Net Loss of $4.7M and Operating Cash Flow of -$3.8M in the 2020 9M period. The ability to become cash flow positive this early in the company's history is very impressive and speaks to management's ability to drive profitable growth

**Valuation considerations:**  

* As of Friday 6/25's closing price of $7.86 per share, Grove has a Market Cap of $111.7M. Subtracting cash of ~$13M (based on $2.1M as of 3/31/21 + $11M in IPO proceeds) and adding debt of ~$3M, we get an Enterprise Value of ~$102M

* Based on the previous 9 month period, the company generated ~$4.5M in revenue per quarter. Assuming they will generate the same amount for the quarter ending June 2021, that results in annual revenue of $17.9M. If we apply an assumption of 100% revenue growth rate for the next 12 months (which I believe is conservative given 163% growth rate in the prior year, and in a year with no trade show revenue), we can forecast $35.8M in revenue for the 12 month forward period. This results in an EV/sales multiple of 2.8x

* Based on a [Cannabis industry research report](https://www.valuationresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Cannabis.pdf), median multiples on run-rate revenue are around 7x EV/sales, with even the bottom 25% percentile trading at 5x. At 2.8x, GRVI is undervalued 

* Given Grove’s strong gross margins and improving profitability, it is likely the company is also undervalued on valuation metrics related to Gross Profit, EBITDA, and Free Cash Flow 

**Management team:**  

The last thing I'll mention is the management team. The CEO Allan Marshall is a long-time entrepreneur and executive, having founded Segmentz Inc., a logistics company which eventually became XPO Logistics. The CFO also comes from Segmentz. The quality of this management team seems very strong for the scale of the company.

I’ve been closely following gold prices for a few months now and have seen a lot of discussions around the relationship between inflation and a potential increase in interest rates which would negatively impact gold as investors seek better risk-adjusted yield opportunities in bonds.

Despite interest rate concerns, I still believe gold is a decent hedge given the S&amp;P hitting new all-time highs. The Fed continues to reassure the market that interest rates won’t move until late 2022 at the earliest. In my opinion, inflation may run hot for the next year giving gold a decent tailwind. I know this is a simple macro overview, but let’s move on to the trade opportunity.

I have noticed that Barrick has been lagging its major competitor Newmont this year, why? It already traded at a lower multiple compared to Newmont at the start of the year which makes sense as it has lower operating margins/growth expectations. There doesn’t appear to be an explicit reason for the relative dispersion between the 2 companies’ share price YTD when they have historically been very correlated.

Here are my 2 potential strategies:

#1 Target Price Realization: Go long common stock while selling monthly calls 5-10% above purchase price. Current monthly implied volatility shows about 2-3% monthly premium. Not bad. If I get assigned first month, would re-enter.

#2 Pairs Trade: Go long Barrick ($GOLD) and short Newmont ($NEM) until both securities revert to their mean averages of the past 5 years (89% correlation).

In summary, I strongly believe there is a 15-20% short term opportunity here which may not be groundbreaking but still outperforming the broader market if this happens in 6 months. Which strategy would you implement?",Barrick Gold ($GOLD) lagging competitors YTD. Short term opportunity?,1624717751

stocks,"$EAF, GrafTech International, is one of the largest players in the electric arc furnace (EAF) game. EAFs are used to melt scrap steel, a cheaper alternative to freshly smelted ore made in a blast furnace. 

As steel prices have skyrocketed, big players like $CLF have followed suit and likely have more upside. Between the massive economic growth predicted and infrastructure bill being passed, steel prices will remain elevated. However, $EAF is considerably downstream of the demand. Steel is heavy and  usually not all that expensive, making it a last choice for scrappers in normal times. With a huge lack of supply, scrap prices have gone up considerably. This will increase scrapping volume, and as such drive demand for GrafTechs furnaces. 

Additionally, as countries scramble to curb emissions, more emphasis will be placed on replacing aging blast furnaces with electric arc furnaces that run on electricity in combination with petroleum coke, rather than exclusively coke (which is usally coal coke), making them both more efficient and more environmentally friendly. It also cuts out the need to mine new iron ore, a process that entails it’s own emissions and environmental damage. China has already stated their intent to move away from blast furnaces and increase EAF capacity. As electricity becomes significantly cheaper than coal as the world (and especially China and the US, two huge scrap markets) scales up renewables, EAFs will become increasingly attractive. 

This is a long term play and I encourage you to do your own DD. I believe the company is very fairly valued at a ~8 p/e and 7.23 fwd p/e. Financials are alright but improving, with considerable debt which is being paid off aggressively. The last earnings call noted they are beginning to see increased demand as they come out of a lull from the pandemic. The dividend was cut significantly to a mere .33%, a show of fiscal responsibility that has hurt the share price. 

The EAF market is highly competitive and it will depend on scrap volume to increase significantly in order to get out of the pricing wars the industry is likely engaged in currently. However, EAF produces great ultra high powered furnaces and are also vertically integrated with a petroleum coke producer, making them my pick for the industry even as petroleum coke remains in short supply. 

Analyst PTs range from 14-16 with an average of 15.25, indicating 27% upside from current levels. This stock is beaten down and I’m here for it.

My current position is in Jan 22’ $10c as it provides pretty cheap leverage, however I will likely be adding shares and if you have the capital that is certainly what I would recommend. This will take many years to fully play out. GLTA.",$EAF an entirely overlooked play on steel,1624717268

$BZUN is the only stock I currently have in my portfolio that was purchased prior to 2020.

stocks,"The market has experienced many important financial events including recessions and bubbles, but when do we know when those events occur and how do we profit from them? According to [fidelity,](https://www.fidelity.com/viewpoints/investing-ideas/sector-investing-business-cycle) there are market cycles that impact different market sectors differently. The different stages cycles are the following; the recession, where the sector loses value after some sort of financial crisis, the early rebound, where the market strongly rebounds after the recession causing a jump in value, the peaking stage, where the sector rises and reaches its peaks, and finally, the moderation cycle, where the sector’s price moderates and consolidation occurs. 

&amp;#x200B;

After understanding the concept of market cycles, we need to find out where we are now in terms of them. It depends on the sector, but let's just look at the Nasdaq and the s&amp;p 500. These help quantify the market trends so we can find out what stage of the cycle we are in.

&amp;#x200B;

Both the s&amp;p 500 and the Nasdaq mirror each other in their graphs so we can assume that they are affected by the same events in the same way. We can also see the previous market cycles that have played out through the years including the financial crisis of 2000’s recession, gains, peak, and moderation followed by the real estate crash in 08-09, leading up to the gains and peaks before the covid crash. If we are considering the covid crash a recession, then we are in the first stage of early rebound and gains with the possibility of peaks being reached. The growth of both the Nasdaq and the S&amp;P 500 are exponentially greater than the gains of the other first-stage rebounds despite the crash sizes being comparable in size. We can also entertain the possibility of the next crash being much bigger than the previous ones. According to Fidelity’s chart of sectors that should do very well during the rebound stage, healthcare, energy, and utility sectors tend to underperform.

&amp;#x200B;

We can see that these sectors mirror each other in the sense that they are underperforming in regards to both the S&amp;P500 and the Nasdaq since the Covid crash. This checks out as it is stated in Fidelity’s chart that these sectors(Energy, Healthcare, and Utilities) tend to underperform post crash. Stock sectors that, according to Fidelity’s chart tend to perform very well post rebound, are in fact doing very well. These sectors include financial, real estate, consumer discretionary, materials, industrial, and information technology.

&amp;#x200B;

Now that we can validate Fidelity’s graph more, we can be more sure of the coming trends. In the event of this current stage being the peak of the market in this cycle, we can use this information to find stocks that perform the best in the following stages. The sectors that perform well during the peak and moderation stages are consumer staples, communication, healthcare, and energy. According to Fidelity, recessions generally negatively affect sectors so it is best to take a defensive position on the sectors that tend to underperform in a recession situation. The stock sectors that underperform during a recession are real estate, information technology, industrials, and communication services. 

Conclusion:

We are at the peak of a stock market cycle after a recession and the stocks that are going to underperform are *x* and the stocks that are going to overperform during the recession are *y*. Regardless of how well a sector could overperform, it is generally a good idea to take a defensive position during a recession.",The outcome of our current market cycle,1624681169

stocks,"I was wondering how are valuations of a company determined for a start up and/or up and coming company?

the reason why i ask is, i like to watch sharktank segments once in a while. 

and obviously these companies are all currently privately owned.

However, whenever they go on the show looking for investments, the company valuation seems to be done in such a linear fashion. The main (and seems like ONLY) valuation method the sharks use is simply investment * equity.

so if someone is asking for a 100k for 10% equity in the company, the sharks simply see it as them saying their company is worth $1MM.

and yes, i get that. its true asking for a 100k for 10% equity is the same thing as saying their company is worth $1MM. but what i DONT get is that it seems like thats the only metric everyone on the show is using. any other argument the person seeking investment uses is denied by the sharks.

stocks,"Hey guys! Posted a little while ago about my project that invests based on sentiment analysis (I know you've seen sentiment trackers abound) and wanted to give an update and some new numbers. Long story short for the week -- you'll $WISH you had $AMC in your portfolio last week, and...eh I got nothing. **IMPORTANT:** Most of the below is a repost of stuff I've posted before (other than the new numbers), but I've added/trimmed down as I get better at explaining the right stuff.

Here's the [source code](https://github.com/tstewart161/Reddit_Sentiment_Trader)! **Note: I include this in case there are algo-traders here, but neither the code nor the algo is the focal point of this post.** Also, this does need to be edited according to your needs (how many of the top you want to invest in, how you want to deploy it, etc.)

I rebalanced my portfolio last week to include the 15 stocks below (equal-weighted), giving me a **2.18% return week over week (net of any fees/slippage), compared to a 0.39% loss for SPY and 0.66% loss for my benchmark, the VanEck BUZZ Social Sentiment ETF**. Important to note that not every week is a breakout win (even if some member stocks in the ETF are), and not every week is a win at all. I've had some weeks where I've trailed both SPY and BUZZ by a lot, but overall I'm beating SPY YTD and BUZZ since its introduction on March 4. This algorithm has returned 52%, compared to SPY's 10% and BUZZ's 7%.

Your typical sentiment analysis stuff coming through. I do this stuff for fun and make money off the stocks I pick doing it most weeks, so thought I'd share. I created an algo that scans the most popular trading sub-reddits and logs the tickers mentioned in due-diligence or discussion-styled posts. In addition to scanning for how many times each ticker was mentioned in a comment, I also logged the popularity of the comment (giving it something similar to an exponential weight -- the more upvotes, the higher on the comment chain and the more people usually see it) and/or post, and finally checked for the sentiment of each comment/self text post.

&amp;#x200B;

**How is sentiment calculated?**

This uses VADER ( Valence Aware Dictionary for Sentiment Reasoning), which is a model used for text sentiment analysis that is sensitive to both polarity (positive/negative) and intensity (strength) of emotion. The way it works is by relying on a dictionary that maps lexical (aka word-based) features to emotion intensities -- these are known as sentiment scores. The overall sentiment score of a comment/post is achieved by summing up the intensity of each word in the text. In some ways, it's easy: words like ‘love’, ‘enjoy’, ‘happy’, ‘like’ all convey a positive sentiment. Also VADER is smart enough to understand the basic context of these words, such as “didn’t really like” as a rather negative statement. It also understands the emphasis of capitalization and punctuation, such as “I LOVED” which is pretty cool. Phrases like “The turkey was great, but I wasn’t a huge fan of the sides” have sentiments in both polarities, which makes this kind of analysis tricky -- essentially with VADER you would analyze which part of the sentiment here is more intense. There’s still room for more fine-tuning here, but make sure to not be doing too much. There’s a similar phenomenon with trying to hard to fit existing data in stats called overfitting, and you don’t want to be doing that.

The best way to use this data is to learn about new tickers that might be trending. This gives many people an opportunity to learn about these stocks and decide if they want to invest in them or not - or develop a strategy investing in these stocks before they go parabolic. **Although the results from this algorithm have beaten benchmarked sentiment indices like BUZZ and FOMO (on a risk-adjusted basis), sentiment analysis is by no means a “long term SPY-beating strategy.”** I’m well aware that most of my crazy returns are from GME and AMC (and more recently, WISH). These tickers do show up in BUZZ, but after they do on Reddit and at a lower weighting.

So, the data from last week:

**Reddit - Highest Sentiment Equities This Week (what’s in my portfolio)**

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning June 28th, 2021.

# **The jobs report will move markets in the week ahead as stocks enter the second half riding high - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/25/the-jobs-report-will-move-markets-in-the-week-ahead-as-stocks-enter-the-second-half-riding-high.html)**
*****
&gt; The monthly jobs report is the highlight in the coming week, as June winds down and markets start the second half of the year.
*****
&gt; Economists are expecting about 700,000 jobs. That’s better than the 559,000 in May but below the forecasts of several months ago that payroll creation would be rolling along with monthly gains of at least 1 million.
*****
&gt; The report is a key read on the labor market, which has replaced lost jobs more slowly than expected as companies complain about worker shortages and difficulty finding help. But it is also being watched as a gauge on how sticky the current jump in inflation might be. Rising wages are one thing to watch but also worker scarcity, since that can make goods and services more expensive.
*****
&gt; Stocks have turned in a mixed performance for the month of June so far. The S&amp;P 500 was up 1.8% as of Friday for the month, and up 7.7% in the second quarter for a 15.6% year-to-date gain. The Nasdaq was up 4.4% in June and up 8.4% for the quarter. The Dow, meanwhile, lagged in June with a modest 0.3% decline, but it is up 4.4% quarter-to-date.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500, ending Friday at 4,280, has already edged slightly above 4,276 — the average year end forecast of Wall Street strategists surveyed by CNBC.
*****
&gt; For the most part, strategists expect the market to continue its upward trajectory into the second half, although at a slower pace. Some have also said the second half could bring a pause in the rally before the market ends the year higher.
*****
&gt; “I think it’s been very good for the stock market that long rates have stopped going up in the first quarter and are going down, taking the pressure off,” The Leuthold Group chief investment strategist Jim Paulsen said.
*****
&gt; “Meanwhile earnings have continued to climb unabated, and if you think about it the vast majority of stocks didn’t go anywhere in the second quarter,” Paulsen said. “What we’ve got is a cheaper market than we had in March and we had one where rates are lower and we’re still getting unrestricted policy help from both monetary and fiscal authorities.”
*****
&gt; Paulsen said he thinks the S&amp;P 500 could hit 4,500 before pulling back later in the year to finish at about 4,100.
*****
&gt; “My attitude now is it’s a very hard tape to fight, and it takes a lot of fortitude to do so, but you’re at a point where it’s a lot cheaper to hedge than it has been,” Interactive Brokers chief strategist Steve Sosnick said. “It’s a lot cheaper to hedge and a more opportune time to do so. It’s always cheaper to buy an umbrella when there are no rain clouds on the horizon.”
*****
&gt; Stocks were higher in the past week, despite the turbulence the week earlier after the June Federal Reserve meeting. The Fed laid the groundwork for its ultimate step away from easy policies, with Fed Chairman Jerome Powell saying Fed officials were considering tapering their purchases of mortgages and Treasury securities.
*****
&gt; “There seems to be a greater complacency,” Sosnick said, noting the market reaction to the Fed’s potential unwind of easy policy was calm.
*****
&gt; If the Fed announces it will taper its bond purchases in the next several months, it would be expected to wait several months more before it starts the process. Then it could take many more months to take the $120 billion in monthly purchases to zero. The unwind of that policy is especially important since it could be a precursor to the Fed raising interest rates.
*****
&gt; “Underlying everything, there’s a huge faith in the Fed, that they will do the right thing, and they’ll continue to do the right thing,” Sosnick said.
*****
&gt; Sosnick said he’s watching the bond market going into quarter end this week, after the surge in yields last quarter end. The relatively tame behavior of bond yields, which move opposite price, has been a hallmark of the last part of the second quarter.
*****
&gt; The benchmark 10-year Treasury was yielding 1.52% Friday, up from 1.45% a week prior.
*****
&gt; Sosnick said if the 10-year yield does remains contained, that should be good for tech. “Right now, it appears there’s that kind of relationship between the 10-year and NDX. If 10-year yields are lower, people are using it as a buy signal for the Nasdaq 100. Is that fool proof? Far from it, but people are using it,” he said.
*****
&gt; Tech stocks were up 2.4% for the week and 9.4% for the quarter so far, after being out of favor when yields were moving higher in March.
*****
&gt; “The advice at the end of the first quarter was that [10-year] rates were going to 2%. Rather than going up, rates went down and as a result growth beat value and techs beat financials,” The Leuthold Group’s Paulsen said. “Now everyone thinks rates are going to stay low longer. I think value, cyclicals and small caps are going to win this quarter. I think we’re going to have a correction and end the year around 4,100.”
*****
&gt; # Jobs, jobs, jobs
&gt; The payroll number Friday morning is by far the biggest economic event of the week.
*****
&gt; “We expect next week’s June employment report to show that nonfarm payrolls expanded by 800k, pushing the unemployment rate down to 5.5% from 5.8%. Strong demand and weak supply should continue to put upward pressure on wages,” wrote Bank of America economists.
*****
&gt; According to Dow Jones, economists expect 683,000 payrolls were created in June and the unemployment rate fell to 5.7% from 5.8%. But the market is also looking to see if the data reveals anything new about inflation and whether it could be transitory, or temporary, as the Fed has stated.
*****
&gt; “The problem is because the markets have tended to surprise us, it’s tough to figure out what the trade is,” said Sosnick. “There’s two components of it. It is the unemployment rate, or the labor force participation, the stuff Powell is really looking for.”
*****
&gt; Wage data could be hot with the Dow Jones estimate at a 3.7% year-over-year gain in average hourly wages, up from 1.98% in May.
*****
&gt; “Are we approaching full employment? With non non-transitory inflationary affects?” Sosnick said. “You’re seeing companies giving signing bonuses. Those are transitory but if you have to raise wages and if wages are going to go up, that is non transitory.”
*****
&gt; Besides the jobs data, there is ISM manufacturing data and monthly vehicle sales Thursday.
*****
&gt; OPEC also meets on July 1, and market pros are watching to see if the OPEC and its alliance in OPEC plus will continue to add oil to the market.

&gt; # July has been Top Month of Post-Election Years

&gt; July historically is the best performing month of the third quarter however, the mostly negative results in August and September tend to make the comparison easy. Two “hot” Julys in 2009 and 2010 where DJIA and S&amp;P 500 both gained greater than 6% and strong performances in 2013 and 2018 have boosted July’s average gains since 1950 to 1.3% and 1.1% respectively. Such strength inevitability stirs talk of a “summer rally”, but beware the hype, as it has historically been the weakest rally of all seasons (page 74, Stock Trader’s Almanac 2021).

&gt; July begins NASDAQ’s worst four months and is the fifth weakest performing NASDAQ month since 1971, posting a 0.6% average gain. Dynamic trading often accompanies the first full month of summer as the beginning of the second half of the year brings an inflow of new capital. This creates a bullish beginning, a soft week after options expiration and some strength towards the end.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/24425b5573f14df7e7f5039ac0dd34f4/01813a8e14a72b86-9a/s400x600/8951bac1faa8d0887549c23fc161e859a01787fd.jpg))**

&gt; Post-election year Julys rank at or near the top of all post-election year months. DJIA, S&amp;P 500, and NASDAQ are ranked #1. Russell 2000 ranks #2. Delving deeper into this data revealed that many of these past “hot” Julys were preceded by a flat or down first half of the year so there is no guarantee that this July will live up to its historical post-election year record again this year.

&gt; # Bears in Hibernation

&gt; The S&amp;P 500's dip below its 50-DMA and the corresponding rally to new all-time highs did little to dramatically change investor sentiment. This week's survey results from the AAII saw bullish sentiment fall slightly from 41.1% last week to 40.4%. That is once again within the past several weeks' range at the lowest level since only two weeks ago.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/06/062421-AAII-Bull.png))**

&gt; Bearish sentiment was also lower this week, falling by 2.9 percentage points to 23.3%. As with bullish sentiment, that is the lowest level in two weeks. From a longer-term perspective, bearish sentiment is more than 7 percentage points below its historical average of 30.5%. In other words, while sentiment is not exuberant, it continues to skew optimistic.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/06/062421-AAII-Bear.png))**

&gt; The historically muted level of bearish sentiment also shows up in the Investors Intelligence survey of newsletter writers. This week, that reading fell half of one percentage point to 15.8%. That is the lowest percentage of respondents reporting as bearish since March 14th, 2018. Over the past 30 years, there have been only a handful of other periods with lower levels of market pessimism.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/06/062421-II-Bear-2.png))**

&gt; Pivoting back to the AAII survey, with bearish sentiment historically muted, a larger share of investors are reporting as neutral. 36.6% of respondents reported as such this week, up 3.9 percentage points from the six-week low last week.

&gt; # Manufacturing Activity Indices at Historic Levels

&gt; As recent economic data shows, the robust post-COVID recovery has brought about a historic rebound in U.S. manufacturing activity. Pent-up demand and low inventories of capital goods have caused companies to fire up their machines at record levels, and manufacturing supply management professionals have responded with relative delight in recent surveys. Both the IHS Markit and Institute for Supply Management (ISM) Manufacturing Indices have been robust across the board, as new order growth, hiring plans, and the backlog of orders point to better health in the sector. The downside…higher prices, as purchasing managers’ queried in the survey pinpointed high levels of input cost inflation brought about by a broad-based spike in raw materials prices. The latest survey results show the June IHS Markit U.S. Manufacturing PMI at a new all-time high of 62.6, which compares to the Bloomberg consensus estimate of 61.5 and May’s reading of 62.1.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/6.24.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1)**

&gt; “The demand for goods and the rebound in manufacturing activity have been remarkable as folks seem determined to get on with their lives. We know that U.S. consumers like to spend, and it seems like they are more than willing to make up for lost time.” explained LPL Financial Director of Research Marc Zabicki.

&gt; We believe the latest IHS Markit manufacturing readout may foretell a good result for the ISM benchmark’s expected release on July 1. That index series has also been near record levels, although just below its all-time high. The long-term ISM chart paints a fairly good picture of past peaks and troughs and the roller-coaster of activity that can occur in the manufacturing sector. In fact, the recent highs in the two manufacturing indicators we have mentioned have us looking ahead to an eventual deceleration in activity, which could come later this year. This deceleration could be brought about by the ultimate slowing of demand for some of the hottest items of late: automobiles, appliances, and technology devices. This doesn’t mean we are souring on the prospect for economic growth in the U.S….only that peak activity, as we are witnessing now, which is usually followed by an eventual slowdown in demand. We should see some of this become visible via U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) growth that is expected to advance at a slower pace in late 2021 and early 2022.

***Please note:*** *I've seen a lot of questions surrounding the analyst price target upgrades that I post, so I just wanted to clear some things up and explain my reasoning behind including them.*

*I frequently get asked if I think analyst price target predictions are ""accurate"" or if I expect a stock I mention to hit the price predicted.* ***The answer to both these questions is NO.*** 

*I really don't put much, if any importance, on the actual numbers predicted by an analyst. They are just a meter to gauge how bullish or bearish they are. My purpose in including price target upgrades is to find trends in analyst thinking. In other words, if I see a bunch of different, well-known analysts all giving bullish target increases on a stock, I'll start doing research on a stock to see why they are so bullish. I have found quite a few profitable trades in this manner.*

***In short, the purpose of the price target upgrades is idea generation. Keep an eye out if you start seeing the same stock receiving bullish target increases by different analysts.***

Stocks were mixed, but mostly positive today, with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) recording a fresh intraday high and the Dow Jones (DIA) nicely continuing its recovery after falling last week, driven higher by a boost in bank stocks across the board after the Fed removed all pandemic-era restrictions on capital distributions. The Nasdaq (QQQ) fell modestly after several days of reaching new all-time highs. The core personal consumption expenditures, which serves as the Fed’s preferred gauge for inflation was released but did not adversely affect the market, another signal the market is prepared to stomach higher than usual inflationary readings as the economy continues to recover. 

The core PCE index measures the changes in prices paid by consumers for goods and services, minus volatile food and energy prices, which are staples and therefore not considered in the equation. The report registered a 3.4% year-on-year increase for May, in-line with Wall Street estimates and marking the fastest jump since 1992. However, it is important to note that the report is still reflecting “base effects” as prices rebound from the pandemic-induced collapse last year. 

Yesterday, the Federal Reserve released the results of its “stress test” on US banks, an annual test instituted after the 2008 financial crisis meant to determine the financial health of lenders during an extreme hypothetical financial crisis (not unlike what was experienced last year).The test used a hypothetical “severely adverse” scenario where the U.S. economy saw GDP shrink by 4%, the unemployment rate rise to 10.75%, and the stock market contract by 55%. In the end, the test showed the 23 largest banks could withstand $474 billion in losses from loans and other positions and still emerge with more than double the minimum required capital.

The results of this stress test are extremely important because last year, during the height of the pandemic, the Fed imposed restrictions on banks on capital distributions like dividends and buybacks in order to ensure banks would have enough capital to weather the storm. Given the clean bill of health, these restrictions have now been fully lifted, paving the way for banks across the board to raise dividends and ramp up stock buyback programs. To put in extent how much money this is, the six largest banks in the US - Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup, Goldman Sachs (GS), JP Morgan (JPM), Morgan Stanley (MS) and Wells Fargo (WFC) - are expected to increase payouts by $66 billion to $130 billion over the next four quarters.

In other news, President Joe Biden announced he had reached an infrastructure agreement with a bipartisan group of senators, which catalyzed a jump in industrial stocks that had been lagging the last few weeks. The deal, which would cost $1.2 trillion over the next five years, commits  $312 billion toward traditional infrastructure priorities such as roads, bridges, public transit, airports and waterways. The bulk of the remainder will be invested in water, broadband and power grid restoration, according to a fact sheet provided by the White House. 

Gabriela Santos, global market strategist at JP Morgan said, “The way we're thinking about it is, it has the positive side of the deal in terms of the equity market perspective: More spending on physical infrastructure, electric vehicles, 5G and broadband, without the tax increases which would have been a negative from the equity market perspective. This is certainly a positive especially for the more domestic, cyclical-heavy parts of the market, as well as parts of technology like semiconductors, which are more related to the 5G and the green theme."" 

**Highlights**

* Yesterday, ARK Investment Manager Cathie Wood and Twitter and Square (SQ) CEO Jack Dorsey have been named as co-hosts of “The ₿ Word,” a new initiative designed to bring business and technology leaders together to discuss how institutions can use digital currencies. Today, through Twitter (TWTR) Jack directly asked Elon to speak at the conference, which he accepted. Will be interesting to see what happens. 
* Panasonic, Tesla’s (TSLA) leading battery supplier, announced it has sold its entire stake in TSLA stock for roughly $3.6 billion. There is no word as to why they did this but Panasonic assured the move would not affect its supply of batteries. Years ago, Panasonic made a $1.6 billion bet on building a joint battery factory with Tesla in Nevada called the Gigafactory. It caused years of losses at Panasonic before the company said this year it was finally turning a quarterly profit.
* Chinese ride-hailing giant Didi is seeking to IPO in the US, according to the company’s latest regulatory filing. 
* Starbucks CEO denied a Wall Street Journal report that the company was running low in supplies of cups and coffee. CEO Kevin Johnson told Jim Cramer, “there is no shortage of cups, no shortage of coffee”.

Graphite - 200 lbs of it on average per single consumer electric vehicle.

World lacks necessary supply to fund EV growth battery demands.

Several stocks are coming out to fuel this industry.

Two forms are mined then processed, or synthetic processed from petroleum byproducts.

Threats include solid state batteries.

Currently CATL, LG, Samsung, Tesla source their graphite from small, scattered producers across the globe.

Biden wants U.S. EV dominance, U.S. wants secure supply chains for rare earth metals and graphite.

Tesla wants clean graphite sourced from the North American continent.

There is a single U.S. graphite producer($WWR).  Several small graphite mining start ups coming up in the OTC's(Syraah, Sir Mick Davis company), and a single Canadian graphite producer($NMG).

Graphite demands will increase 100x with EV battery production demands, industry will need to be stood up quickly and produce large volumes of product.

Edit: By the way personal opinion stay away from the graphite mining stocks and go with the graphite PRODUCING stocks (Factories) they can produce battery grade graphite from natural mined graphite or petroleum byproducts and it's the more profitable and stable of the side, the company you pick should at least be producing even if it mines also, there are several.",DD: Electric Vehicles &gt; Batteries &gt; Graphite : simple form,1624644162

The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, part of the European Medicines Agency, recommended granting marketing authorization in the European Union for roxadustat as a treatment for anemia symptoms in chronic kidney disease patients.

The decision, announced on Friday, and made Thursday by the committee, amounts to a seal of approval for the drug, though marketing authorization must be granted by the European Commission.""

He talks about the inverse relation between (rapid) increase in oil prices, lowering supply and high demand, but he takes a detour. The dotcom bubble dropped sp500 -40%, nasdaq -80%, 16trillion USD wealth went to 7 trillion. The fed lowered rates to 0.75%, boosted borrowing and home prices served as a healthy collateral, which can only go up right? US was highly in debt before the bust, but after… oh with low rates causing booms in home prices, more debt. In this 2004 books he says, if home prices would fall it would be taking down the banking system (1:6 leverage at that time so 18% default was needed to make the banks insolvent, we know later the leverage was 1:20 so 5% default was enough). What would cause home prices to fall? Policies to curb inflation, aaaand when did the fed start to raise rates? Yes, early 2007. No more cheap refinancing causing defaults (subprime etc), and booooom.

* PTRA is not some 2025+ until revenue ""company."" They're building and selling electric busses all over the country right now.

* Backing from Washington.
   * The Secretary of Energy - Jennifer Granholm - was [previously on the board of directors](https://www.cnn.com/2021/05/27/politics/jennifer-granholm-proterra-stock/index.html) of Proterra before surrendering the position to take her position in the administration.
   * Before the reverse merger, on the [board of Arclight](https://arclightclean.com/our-team/) was the co-founder of lobbyist Clean Energy for Biden (now Clean Energy for America), Audrey Lee.
   * Biden recently took a video conference tour of the factory. I won't link it here because auto-mod kills posts with links to certain video websites to protect against grifters. Easy to find with a simple search though. 
* As crowded as the EV space is, there just isn't solid US-based competition keeping them from seizing the moment. [This article](https://www.greenbiz.com/article/5-electric-bus-makers-shifting-next-gear) does well to show the competition, which is all EU/CN-based. Over and over, the Sec of Energy and President himself have stressed they want US-based companies to reap the fiscal initiatives. They are a E-bus company, not passenger vehicles. They're not wasting capital trying to edge out TSLA, F, GM, VW, etc. They know their niche, they are the main player in it, and it's about to get big fiscal tailwinds for this.
   * Municipalities aren't just buying this to show how ""green"" they are. EV busses promise to dramatically reduce preventative and corrective maintenance over the lifetime. If the Feds are fiscally rewarding you for making this switch, why wouldn't they go this route over renewing ICE busses 100% on their own dime?
* The odd pump-and-dump you see from a few months ago was when it was a S\*AC at the height of those pump-and-dumps, and it entered into an agreement with Proterra (it's no longer a S\*AC). The wheat is separating from the chaff among those companies now.

stocks,"for starters: this is only the second time I've done a DD like this, and I welcome criticism if you have any. I'm not a financial advisor, I'm like many of you, a redditor who got too interested in the markets while I've been working from home. 

Allow me to introduce you to an American semiconductor play that's poised to do very well in the short and medium terms. Skywater Technology is a Minnesota-based foundry that helps companies develop prototypes for highly specialized semiconductors. They're currently opening a second facility in Florida to expand production and capabilities. They also build radiation-resistant semiconductors for the Department of Defense, aerospace, and automotive sectors. While it was established in the early 90s, it only IPO'd a few months ago, so this is a stable, solid company with an established client based that's poised to grow as semiconductor demand increases.

I'm not going to get into balance sheets or earnings reports or anything like that, because they mostly don't matter for the catalysts I'm talking about, and we only have two from this year since they IPO'd. If you want earnings or income or whatever, look elsewhere: they're still negative. That looks to change as their second facility comes online in Florida, but like I said, it doesn't matter for most of the information below.

The stock has increased significantly since it IPO'd near $14. It's currently sitting closer to $30. It has a number of very short term and medium term catalysts that will propel the stock to new highs, but first let me explain:

* One of the reasons it has had such an increase in price is because it has a very low float, about 7.5 million shares, and most of its investors know that there's nothing but up for this company, so they never sell. (The short-term catalyst is based on this knowledge.) 
* Another note is that this is not a short squeeze, because nobody shorts this company because it's absolutely suicide. The stock only goes up. It's %short is less than 2% of float.

#Short-term: Russel 3000 today.

[The Russell has announced that $SKYT will be included in the Russell 3000 later today.](https://www.skywatertechnology.com/press-releases/skywater-technology-set-to-join-russell-3000-index/) This is the first time this stock has been indexed, and as such the index will be forced to buy shares. With a low float and a small shareholder base comprised of buy-and-hold investors, this volume will cause a spike in the price. 

#Medium-term: Semiconductor funding

The US federal government has been working on a bill to secure American semiconductor manufacturing. Skywater is wholly based in the US, with a foundry in Minnesota and another about to open up in Florida. It's a key provider for radiation-resistant chips for the Department of Defense, and might be the only company able to fulfill some of those contracts. At a market cap of 1.2 billion, it's very likely to receive the most money from this bill by market cap of any company. [Shortly before the Senate agreed on their version of the bill, the senator from Minnesota, Amy Klobuchar, as well as their US Representative Dean Phillips toured the plant.](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210602005861/en/SkyWater-Hosts-Senator-Amy-Klobuchar-and-Representative-Dean-Phillips) This company is on Congress's radar. They're getting a nice piece of the pie.

#Another catalyst of questionable term

Another factor is that Skywater does not trade options. This is likely due to the relatively low volume of the stock. The above catalysts could propel the volume high enough for options trading. If options start being traded, volume will further increase. Volume is $SKYT best friend, and if you're a $SKYT investor, it's your best friend too.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

stocks,"so I'm a young guy with no investment experience and I'm trying to wrap my head around stocks.

At first I thought that you would buy a stock because you want to 'invest' in the company and because of the investment, the company will get money and use it to grow.    
This is kind of half right.  Its only really true for the IPO.  When the company sells ownership to the public.  But IPO only happens once, and for like Amazon their IPO was well before the stock started doing anything.    
So, Amazon sells ownership to the public, they get a bunch of money to invest in their operations and grow the business.  And investors own part of the company.  Then investors can trade these stocks.  
But about 10 years after the IPO, the stock price starts going up, and up, and up.  And this money doesn't go to Amazon.  When you buy the stock, you're buying from another investor who wants to sell.  Could also be the company too but not always.  So the reason you would buy is because you think the price is going to go up and you can sell it later for more money.  


So the stock is worth whatever someone is willing to pay for it.  It just seems a bit weird to me how the money travels.   Stocks with dividends make the most sense of how to determine its worth because there is quantifiable worth there.  But I was also reading that most stocks are not dividends stocks and typically you can make more money on non-dividend stocks.

So just a tiny bit of background. I also wrote a post on HMPT and LDI a few weeks ago, however it hasnt done anything to these stocks... These are both mortgage companies that are cash cows, but were crushed 2nd week of May right after RKT missed earnings. RKT is the market leader. Before RKT report HMPT was under 1% short and LDI was maybe 7-8%... I say this because I believe the whole sector was attacked immediately after a small miss on RKT. RKT was always heavily shorted since its IPO..... The only thing is RKT and UWMC have recovered HMPT and LDI have not!

LDI has given a 200 million special dividend 62 cents a share and declared a regular 8 cent dividend a quarter..... I guess those dont matter as its near an all time low?

HMPT hasnt done anything just yet but they made 150 million last quarter alone!! Are set to make 300 million this year, and the company is 900 million market cap and heavy short. LDI is under 4 billion and set to make nearly 1 billion. they both have amazing cash flows and enough to pay all bills... and do a serious share buyback....

My question is, should they do another special dividend? a buyback? go private? Pay people on social media to garner interest on the stocks?

U.S.-listed shares of the company were up 1.3% at $12.84 in extended trading.

Revenue fell to $174 million in the first quarter ended May 31 from $206 million a year earlier, but beat analysts' average estimate of $171.25 million, according to Refinitiv-IBES data.

Demand for cybersecurity services have been on the rise as businesses increasingly migrate to cloud-based computing to support remote work during the COVID-19 pandemic.

A boom in electric-vehicle sales has also bolstered demand for BlackBerry's QNX software, primarily used in cars.

And no, this is not skewed by an outlier 2020 for AMZN - it has continually outpaced YoY on each metric, with no indication of slowing down as marketplace continues to benefit from e-commerce adoption and international expansion, and its highly profitable non-marketplace segments continue their hyper growth trajectories.

Amazon is nearing $500b in annual revenue and is still significantly outpacing the other big tech companies in growing the top line, and it’s blowing them out of the water on growing the bottom line. All while dumping almost $100b into R&amp;D and capex and hiring half a million people in the last year.

What other company can boast a business model as expansive, yet still innovative and high growth as Amazon? It has an increasingly diversified and cohesive platform, and all of its segments are category leaders (e-commerce, AWS, gaming/video streaming) or emerging major players (logistics, ads, pharmacy, grocery) in massive addressable markets. Most important, it’s not afraid expand into completely new markets, unlike its mega-cap counterparts.

In my opinion, it’s only a matter of time until Amazon is the highest market cap of the bunch, and frankly I’m not sure how it isn’t already (antitrust be damned - I’ll gladly dump 100% of my portfolio into AWS in any breakup, as if that will ever happen).

The purpose of this post is to create discussion about which plays to make based on current and predicted market trends.  
Obviously right now the world is coming out of the COVID-19 pandemic thanks to vaccination.  This is currently the trend I'd like to focus on.  


A good example to start with is the cruising industry.  Royal Caribbean for example was at a pre-pandemic all time high of $133 per share, meanwhile it dropped to as low as $23 per share during the pandemic and has since recovered to $87 per share - still well below its pre-pandemic level.  Cruise lines have recently been reopening.  Some are facing further delays.  But it appears to me that a stock like Royal Caribbean could be a potential investment.  The market will stabilize eventually and its possible RC or Carnival are currently undervalued.

stocks,"**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, June 24, 2021**

The market edged higher once again, with both the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ) driven higher by an incredible rally in technology stocks. The Dow Jones (DIA), which suffered its worst performance since October 2020 last week continued to recover, pushed higher by a rally in bank and industrial stocks. “Reopening stocks” like cruise lines, hotels, and airlines continue to underperform the market, pressured by the rotation back to growth and concerns that inflation will drive prices in this sector higher. 

After driving the market higher in the beginning of the year, the last two or so months have seen the market firmly rotate from value and cyclical stocks back to growth and technology stocks due to recent inflationary numbers and labor market disruption that threaten to drive prices for services in this sector higher. However, as I have said previously, while I acknowledge the risk, I am not yet concerned that current inflation will become a persistent threat, at least in the near-term. While that may change and I advise people to be ready in case the Fed is forced to tighten rates sooner-than-expected, I expect value and cyclicals to continue recovering as the US economy continues to reopen. With the stock market’s great performance in the last 12-14 months and government coronavirus stimulus, I expect savings-laden consumers to spend big this summer after being cooped up indoors for so long. 

Keith Lerner, Portfolio and Market Strategist at Truist Securities said, “The value trade is still intact. It got overcrowded, it got over-loved ... but when we look at the fundamental drivers behind that trade, they're still intact. So the first thing is, context. Yes, they had a big run this year, but they've trailed for about 14 years, so we've had a long underperformance cycle,"" he added. ""And the second part is, why did they underperform for so long is because we had really slow economic growth. And this year and next we expect above-trend economic growth. And the earnings momentum and the earnings leverage for these areas is still positive."" 

Later today, the Fed is set to release the results of its “stress test” on the US largest banks, an annual test meant to test the financial health of lenders that was instituted following the 2009 financial crisis. The tests are designed to see how banks would fare during a hypothetical extreme economic downturn (not unlike what banks experienced last year). This stress test is extremely important because last year, during the height of the pandemic, the Fed imposed restrictions on banks on capital distributions like dividends and buybacks in order to ensure banks would have enough capital to weather the storm. Thanks to those measures, plus low interest rates and government stimulus that held off loan losses, analysts expect banks to perform well on Thursday, which would lead the Fed to lift remaining capital distribution curbs, opening the floodgates for banks to increase dividends and reinstitute stock buy back programs. **If these restrictions are fully lifted, the six largest banks in the US - Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup, Goldman Sachs (GS), JP Morgan (JPM), Morgan Stanley (MS) and Wells Fargo (WFC) - are expected to increase payouts by $66 billion to $130 billion over the next four quarters. This is huge if it happens.** 

On Friday, Later this week, investors will receive the latest update on core personal consumption expenditures (PCE), which serves as the Fed's preferred gauge of inflation. The report due for release on Friday is expected to register a 3.4% year-on-year increase for May, marking the fastest jump since 1992, albeit while still reflecting ""base effects"" as prices rebound after last year's pandemic-induced collapse in prices across the board

* **As I was finishing the recap the news is out, the Fed is ending pandemic-era restriction on banks in stock buybacks and dividend increases.

* After being under pressure in recent months, shares of Tesla (TSLA) have begun rallying again, with the stock up more than 10% this week alone. 
* Today, Microsoft will unveil the long-awaited sequel to Windows 10. Windows 11, the product's first new version in almost six years, includes only limited changes to its visual design, but it seeks to reposition the operating system as a hub in a computing universe incorporating rival companies' platforms, including Android mobile software developed by Google and a digital storefront developed by Amazon (AMZN).[ Read more here ](https://www.cnet.com/news/microsofts-windows-11-reveal-event-every-upgrade-announced/)
* The House Judiciary Committee voted on Thursday to approve the final piece of its six-part package, the ""Ending Platform Monopolies Act,"" which restricts big tech companies' ability to leverage their platform dominance to promote other lines of business and disadvantage competitors. The vote on the bill was 21-20. The bill will now move on to the House floor and, if passed there, the Senate. The bill is newsworthy but pretty much doomed to fail.
* Snapchat (SNAP) users globally will get access to Universal Music Group's library of recorded music and content for their own content-making on the social media platform, the companies said Thursday. This move comes as US social media companies across the board continue to implement more “TikTok-like” features. To show just how much TikTok has grown, parent company ByteDancehas a market cap of roughly $250 billion, almost $100 billion more than Snap and Twitter (TWTR) combined. 
* **Cathie Wood** and Twitter and Square (SQ) CEO Jack Dorsey have been named as co-hosts of “The ₿ Word,” a new initiative designed to bring business and technology leaders together to discuss how institutions can use digital currencies.

There are definitely tech stocks that show similarities to the stocks that were responsible for 2000 tech crash, such as little to no earnings, pe ratios at 100, 500, or even 1000. But the tech sector and QQQ, which is overweight in tech, is not showing these bubble like characteristics. Most of these companies are large or mega cap companies with years of solid growth and profitability. Yes, they could very well be overvalued, but investing in overvalued companies or sectors is still reasonable if you buy and hold into them with a long time horizon, while dollar cost averaging.

 WUGI is an actively-managed ETF, been holding for a month with nice gains that dont appear to slow down.  

We agree that 5G will empower the next generation of technology that will  rise the global digital economy. 

5G is not a light-switch; it is an evolution. They invest in that long-term growth with adjusting allocations  dynamically as the 5G cycle evolves. 

There 5G assumptions are based on 4 Pillars.. 

1.  **Semis are the nucleus of 5G**:  Every existing device and every facet of the 5G cycle must be upgraded with new semiconductor technology to run faster and smarter, while being more energy-efficient. 5G will require a massive expansion of semiconductor content.  **Because everything needs a Semi now! From your cellphone to your washing machines, Cars, Smart Homes, Drones. Heaviest investment sector of this ETF, companies like $AMD $TSMC $NVDA $QCOM.**
2.  **Cloud giants push into Edge Computing**:   Edge Computing and 5G are interlinked technologies as both are poised to significantly improve the performance of applications (faster speed) and enable huge amounts of data to be processed in real-time (low latency). Applications running on edge locations demand lower latency and reduced bandwidth. **FAAMG stocks come into play here and are VERY important.**
3.  **Cloud-native software to manage data**:  5G will result in a massive amount of new data. The ability to continuously filter and process this new data in real-time will be critical. A new generation of database platforms, big data analytics, and agile software development tools are emerging to help individuals and businesses build digital experiences. **$NVDA and its Datacenter come to play, $NET, $TWLO, $AMZN AWS. The growth will not slow down.** 
4.  **Enabling Technologies**:  When all 5G building blocks are in place, the potential big winners will likely be the enabling technologies (think of Instagram and Netflix in the 4G cycle), giving rise to a wave of new 5G business applications, devices, and services. **Companies like $SE with huge gaming plataforms, as the cycle evolves there will be clearer players here.**

**% Top 10 Holdings**: Sea Ltd 7.98%  NVIDIA Corp 7.97%  AMD 7.94% Meituan Dianping 5.85% Marvell Technology Group Ltd 5.44% Qualcomm Inc 5.26%  Bilibili Inc 4.32%  Taiwan Semiconductors 4.09% Google 4.05% Microsoft Corp 3.70%

Vinco Ventures Inc.'s shares were under pressure Thursday after the buyer of digital media and content technologies said it would spin off its Emmersive Entertainment operation as a standalone traded company.

In morning trading, the stock was 8.3% lower at $4.38, eating into a rally in 2021.

Vinco said the transaction for Emmersive Entertainment would be conducted in the third quarter, with shareholders gaining an equity stake in the separated company. Emmersive Entertainment would be led by current Vinco Strategy Chief Brian McFadden, it said.

The company, which late last year closed the sale of its SRM Entertainment Ltd. subsidiary, in January agreed to merge with content and distribution company ZASH Global Media &amp; Entertainment Corp.",How would a stock spinoff with equity work?,1624556272

Bitfarms ($BITF), based out of Canada, is a Bitcoin mining company. They just IPO'd on the nasdaq Monday. Currently trading around $4.50 per share. They' mined 11,300 BTC since 2017. All mining operations use 100% renewable energy.

SOS Limited ($SOS), based out of China, just recently got involved in crypto. They have recently entered into a joint venture with Niagra development LLC, based out of New Jersey (US), to begin BTC mining operations in the U.S. They have ETH rigs still in China unaffected by the crackdown. More than 90% of their crypto mining rigs use renewable energy. They are also in the process of developing a digital currency exchange (like a Coinbase). And use Blockchain technology for their emergency services offered in China. Currently trading around $3.40 a share. They confirmed Q1 mining produced 42 BTC and 918 ETH.

stocks,"**Caterpillar ($CAT)** is the global leader and largest producer of construction and mining equipment for a reason, and with all the looming infrastructure talks I'm more bullish on Caterpillar than ever. They have set themselves up perfectly to benefit exponentially from the increase in demand in the construction and mining sectors. The $117 billion market capitalization company also provides diesel and natural gas engines, industrial gas turbines and diesel-electric locomotives. At the time of writing this they are up 74% YTD. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Financials &amp; Growth Prospective:**  Caterpillar has experienced a 74% year-over-year improvement in the first-quarter 2021 adjusted earnings per share to $1.93, while revenues increased 12% year over year to $11.9 billion. Over the past two months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Caterpillar for fiscal 2021 has increased around 17%. The consensus mark for fiscal 2022 has also been revised upward by 11% over the same time frame. Caterpillar has outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 41.6%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings for fiscal 2021 for Caterpillar is currently pegged at $9.60, suggesting year-over-year growth of 46%. For fiscal 2022, the estimate for earnings is at $11.91, indicating year-over-year improvement of 24%. 

We can expect that the growth in construction -- not just in the U.S. but worldwide -- will allow Caterpillar to grow earnings-per-share by more than 40% in 2021. This would leave the bottom line still much lower than its pre-pandemic highs, but it would be a very good showing nonetheless. With a new annualized dividend of $4.44 ($1.11/quarter) as of August 20th, 2020, and an expectation for earnings-per-share of $9.20 for 2021, Caterpillar has a projected payout ratio of 48%. This is slightly above the average payout ratio of 45% since 2011. The dividend appears to be well-covered and unlikely to be cut even if earnings-per-share experience another significant decline. 

&amp;#x200B;

**In The News:**

* **Collaborative development of zero-emission mining equipment:** $CAT recently entered into a collaboration agreement with Nouveau Monde Graphite Inc. to develop, test and produce zero-emission machines for the latter’s Matawinie graphite mine. Caterpillar expects to become the exclusive supplier of an all-electric mining fleet for the mine by 2028. The Matawinie project, which will provide high-purity graphite concentrate for electric vehicles, is planned to be the first open pit operation in the world that will exclusively use electric equipment. This is an important milestone in the mining industry as it can be used as a launch pad for other miners focused on cutting down their emissions utilizing Caterpillar’s cutting-edge technologies. 
* **Rio Tinto Plc announced it will deploy the world’s first fully autonomous water truck in partnership with Caterpillar:** This will be located at its $2.6 billion Gudai-Darri iron ore mine in Western Australia’s Pilbara region. Water spraying is a vital part of mining operations and this new technology will enhance productivity by enabling digital tracking of water consumption, while cutting down water wastage. Rio Tinto intends to make Gudai-Darri one of the world’s most technologically advanced mines. Cutting down mining sector’s carbon emissions is the need of the hour. Day by day, more and more mining companies are exploring options to electrify their mines. The switch from diesel to electricity will also cut costs and boost their license to operate. Electrified mines will require less maintenance and human intervention. The use of automation and the Internet of Things (IoT) will increase as drones, autonomous vehicles and remote-controlled operational systems are rolled out more widely across mining operations.",Why I'm So Bullish on $CAT,1624545417

Very new to investing and have a basic question.

Although the stockmarket is at an ATH I want to start investing by DCA'ing into a couple of companies which I plan to hold for at least 10 year

I'm researching CRM and most metrics seem good to my untrained eye.

Revenue is growing strong, although quite a bit of growth is due to acquisition, EBITDA and levered free cash flow both grow annually and debt to equity ratio is declining for the last 5 years and now at 0.60.

The only red flag so to speak is the amount of shares uotstanfing increases every year.

Is this something to be worried about?",CRM shares outstanding increase each year,1624536845

Today is the IPO of Doximity. It is an app (saas) that is a mix between telehealth and a social media platform for doctors, nurse practitioners, PAs, dentists, etc. They are one of a kind in that they’re the only ones with this scope in the industry having the social media platform plus telehealth all in one. 80% (me included) of all doctors in the US use doximity. They also allow you to find jobs in your field and keep you up to date on the latest research. It is going to debut for 26$ and boy is that a deal. 

This business has a market cap around 4 bil and is the market leader in an industry (telehealth, social media for professionals) that is about to drip like the oil boom. According to their S1, this industry is worth ~18 bil and is growing rapidly. That is telehealth. That does not include all the other aspects of this business. Last year alone over 63 million telehealth visits occurred. There are so many implications for this service (seeing patients unable to make it to clinic, counseling, etc). This is just the tip of the ice berg. With the money from the ipo they plan to grow rapidly and may incorporate an electronic medical records with this service eventually, which is fucking huge. It would make my life so much easier lol. 

Within the last year revenue grew 78% from 116.4 mil to 206 mil. They also are already positive with earnings. Their biggest competitor, tdoc, (look at what they ipo at and now) are not profitable. This company is about to fucking boom don’t miss out. I’ve included a few of my sources.

stocks," LONDON — Visa agreed Thursday to acquire Swedish financial technology start-up Tink for 1.8 billion euros ($2.1 billion), in a deal aimed at bolstering the payment giant’s digital ambitions.

The deal comes after Visa’s bid to buy Plaid, an American rival to Tink, was torpedoed by U.S. regulators. Plaid has since opted to go it alone as an independent company, and was last privately valued by investors at $13.4 billion.

Both Plaid and Tink operate in a nascent space known as opening banking, which calls on lenders to provide third-party firms with access to coveted consumer banking data, provided they’ve got consent. Open banking has flourished in Britain and the EU thanks to new regulation.

“Visa is committed to doing all we can to foster innovation and empower consumers in support of Europe’s open banking goals,” Al Kelly, Visa’s CEO, said in a statement.

 “By bringing together Visa’s network of networks and Tink’s open banking capabilities we will deliver increased value to European consumers and businesses with tools to make their financial lives more simple, reliable and secure.”

Founded by Swedish entrepreneurs Daniel Kjellén and Fredrik Hedberg in 2012, Tink initially started out as a financial management app but later pivoted to focus on providing its technology to other businesses instead.

Tink’s technology lets banks and fintech firms access banking data to create new financial products. The Stockholm-based company was last privately valued at 680 million euros. It has raised more than $300 million from investors including PayPal, SEB and ABN AMRO.

“As we got to know Visa, it became clear that we share a common mission – to connect the financial world and accelerate the growth and adoption of digital financial services,” Tink’s founders said in a blog post Thursday.

 “Teaming up with Visa means we’ll now be able to move faster and reach further than ever before, and we know that Visa is the perfect partner for the next stage of our journey.”

Visa’s acquisition of Tink is the latest in a wave of consolidation efforts in the massive payments industry. The company had tried to buy Plaid last year, but ultimately abandoned the takeover after the U.S. Department of Justice sued to block it on antitrust grounds.

The deal with Tink is subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions, Visa said, adding it will be financed solely with cash and won’t impact the company’s stock buyback program or dividend policy.

Tink will keep its branding and management team after the deal, Visa said, while the company’s headquarters will also remain in Stockholm.

stocks,"Dutch foundation targets TikTok in €1.4 billion negligence lawsuit

The Dutch market research foundation SOMI filed a lawsuit against TikTok on Wednesday on behalf of thousands of concerned parents, who accuse the social media platform of negligence in ensuring their children's privacy and safety. ""In total, the mass claim can amount to more than 1.4 billion euros, based on the more than 1 million Dutch minor users,"" SOMI said to RTL Nieuws. 

So far over 64 thousand parents in the European Union joined this case, the foundation said. According to SOMI, TikTok is violating multiple European laws, including privacy laws and laws that prohibit targeting advertisements at children. The app also doesn't properly ask permission for data use, and does not say which data is collected for which purposes. And the Chinese company behind the app collects and stores more data than necessary, and doesn't meet the legal requirements for keeping that data safe, the foundation said. 

SOMI also believes that TikTok doesn't comply with European media rules that are intended to ""protect children from harmful content"", partly referring to online challenges in which children challenge each other to do dangerous things. ""SOMI also believes that more general videos on TikTok can be harmful to young children, for example because of hidden advertisements for harmful products and content that promotes unrealistic ideals of beauty, which can lead to problems such as self-harm and eating disorders.""

The foundation's hope for this case is to get a legal ruling that forces TikTok to adjust its actions. ""A court decision can directly restrict the practices of TikTok - and other social media platforms,"" SOMI co-founder Cor Wijtvliet said to the broadcaster. ""We have sent letters of complaints to TikTok and several European supervisory authorities in the past year, but have not seen any substantive results. That is why we have decided not to wait for the investigations by the authorities and to take legal action ourselves.""

A spokesperson for TikTok told RTL Nieuws that the privacy and safety of its users have ""the highest priority"". ""We are taking industry-leading steps to promote youth security on TikTok, such as setting accounts to Private by default for users under the age of 16, and enabling parents to link their account to their teenage child's through Family Pairing. We continue to evaluate and improve our policies, processes and systems, and continue to consult with external experts.""

Officially, TikTok can only be used by children aged 13 or older, and minors need their parents' permission. In practice, however, these age limits are not well enforced. Earlier this year, a court in Italy ordered TikTok to block users who did not confirm their age, after a 10-year-old girl died in a dangerous challenge on the social media platform.

stocks,"Visa Inc said on Thursday it had agreed a 1.8 billion euro ($2.2 billion) takeover of European open banking platform Tink, months after it ditched a planned acquisition of the startup's U.S. rival Plaid.

Founded in 2012, Sweden-based Tink enables banks and other financial firms to access consumer financial data more easily. It is used by more than 3,400 banks and other institutions, as well as over 250 million customers across Europe.

Visa was forced to terminate a planned $5.3 billion deal with U.S. data-sharing platform Plaid in January, following a U.S. government lawsuit aimed at blocking the deal on antitrust grounds.

Visa said the Tink deal was subject to regulatory approvals.

European Union rules on open banking, also adopted by Britain before it left the bloc, require banks to allow access to customer data by registered third party providers to boost competition.

The rollout of the rules has provided fertile ground for fintechs, such as Tink, which provide technology to help third parties and banks to access customer data.

Visa would retain Tink's brand and management team, and its headquarters would stay in Stockholm, the company said.

The Tink takeover included cash and retention incentives, Visa said, adding the deal would have no impact on its previously announced stock buyback or dividend policy.

stocks,"(Crossposted and slightly modified due to audience, from r/residents as DOCS was being offered to physicians)

I'm a new here but since I see some posts about it, might as well start with this.

I'm a physician in California, 20 years out from residency.

I've been investing with my Stafford Loan $ since MS I and endured several serious market crashes. I enjoy doing financial analysis and have successfully invested in multiple IPOs in the past, including google, mastercard, visa, interactive brokers, and evercore financial. I still HODL GOOG, MA, and V; sold EVR at a modest profit and roughly broke even on IBKR.

This is completely divorced from what I think about the app or the company (I don't like the fax function, don't usually read its articles, and primarily use it so that when I call patients they can't see my mobile #), I am focusing purely on the financials reported by the company. I would be interested in seeing if anyone else has picked up anything that I have blind spots for and cannot see. Thanks in advance.

**tl;dr**: DOCS hits every thing I want to see in (any) company going public. I committed a full 250 share allotment on Fidelity after I had passed on an opportunity to purchase pre-IPO shares through EquityZen

**First.** The [S-1](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001516513/000162828021011269/doximity-sx1.htm) filing is located here.

**Second,** Their financials. For any company you want to look at:

* Revenue (also called 'top line')
* Operating Expenses
* Profit (also called 'bottom line') which is more or less revenue - expenses
* Cash on hand
* Debt
* Why they are going IPO

You want to see that the company is making money both top line and bottom line, you want to see that their costs are not outstripping their revenue and profit growth. **When you are investing in a stock, you are basically laying an (educated) bet that the company will grow their profits. When they grow, your stock grows.**

For the last bullet, you want to see that they have money so that they won't go bankrupt. Generally for why IPO, if the prospectus says, ""to pay back debt"" or ""the company will not receive any proceeds"" then stay the hell away. You want the company to use the money they raise to fund new ventures or anything that will help them grow.

So, under the hood (and very simplified):

&amp;#x200B;

||2019|2020|2021|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Revenues|85.7mm|116.4mm (+30.7%)|206.9mm (+78%)|
|Expenses|67.9mm|79.3mm (+16.8%)|122.4mm (+54.3%)|
|Profit|7.8mm|23.5mm (+201%)|57.7mm (+145%)|

What do we see:

* Increasing rate of change growth in revenue from 2019 -&gt; 2020, and 2020 -&gt; 2021
* Increasing expenses but rate of change is not as much as rate of change of revenues
* Profit every year. Though 2020 - 2021 growth is not as much as 2019 - 2020, it's still more than doubled

DOCS has 142mm in cash on hand, and the only ""debt"" they have is in the form of convertible preferred stock - i.e. no loans taken out.

Why are they IPOing? They are going to use the funds to support growth and investments in the business, or to acquire or invest in complementary businesses or assets.

**In Summary**.

Solely from a financial perspective, the company grows revenues and profits year over year. Their expenses are growing but not as rapidly - plus if you dive into their S-1 they have a significant portion of those expenses used for research and development, which in my mind is actually not an expense but more of an investment in their future. They have cash on hand and no debt. It's a slam dunk and I am not surprised that the IPO priced 3 dollars above their upper range because everyone with financial know how and the ability to get their hands on the stock wanted it.

Cheers and best wishes.

stocks,"Hi all,

  
I’ve spent the past month learning what I can about the space industry and the companies involved.  **Long story short** – Maxar Technologies (MAXR) is the best buy in aerospace right now.   
Maxar is the market leader in both satellite imagery and satellite development for space exploration.  Here is an overview:  


* Maxar has built over 285 different satellites over the years, for various commercial and government customers or for their own constellations.
* Maxar is a frequent contractor for NASA and is the industry leader in robotic arms and electric propulsion technology.
* For the upcoming Moon mission, Maxar is contracted to build the propulsion and communication module – a large and critical part of the spacecraft. 
* Maxar provides 90% of the geospatial intelligence used by the U.S. military
* 3.8 billion people use Maxar imagery every day – through online maps like Google Maps and through telecommunications companies
* Maxar will be critical to innovation globally going forward – every industry and government will increase their use of geospatial technology and Maxar will be the principal company they rely on. 

With a market cap of only $2.8 billion (plus 1.5% insider ownership), Maxar is highly undervalued.  Wall Street analysts give the stock a price target of $52-$60 which would be a 37% gain from where it is now.  I think it is worth a lot more, although I am no expert.

There is a $25 billion pipeline of aerospace contracts over the next five years (a figure being cited by multiple aerospace companies) and Maxar will be in a great position to capitalize on the growing opportunities.  As the market continues to grow, Maxar will become an increasingly bigger player going forward. 

Stock history:

The stock started trading in 2004 at around $20/share.  It peaked from 2014-2015 at $80/share.  Then it crashed from 2016-2018 - hitting a low of $5/share - because of concerns over the amount of debt the company was holding.  Since then, Maxar sold off a portion of the company to a Canadian subsidiary and balanced their budget.  Since 2019 the stock has shown solid growth, now sitting at around $40.   
FYI: For some reason the Fidelity and Robinhood charts only show the stock history since 2017.  Look on Google for the full chart since 2004.",Maxar Technologies (MAXR) is an undervalued space stock,1624509930

*  FIW PHO CWW CGW PIO EBLU (in order of preference)

I just put them all into Trading View Charts and noticed FIW doing the best and EBLU the worst. I also used other compare tools, and noticed the same pattern again. FIW always coming out on top and EBLU at the bottom. I noticed PHO had better fundamentals than FIW even though FIW was always the top line in the performance chart? 

FIW seems more international while PHO is mostly USA, so I will probably have to discount PHO, as I want more international exposure in this sub-industry! 

CWW is based in Canada and pays quarterly dividends.

stocks,"So I saw this $WWR ticker a while back, some scam shit $1.5 to $15 back to $5 classic p&amp;d penny stock mining uranium or some shit.  Or so I thought.  Some 10 months later I saw $WWR again, this time I decided to have a look.  As it turns out, this is actually a real company, not some phony research project brought to the OTC's as a ""stock.  It's a small stock, but real.

The reason it had shot up $1.5 to $15 long ago was an executive order by the president to secure supply of things like graphite inside of the US.  Currently 0% of our graphite is produced in this country (we have literally no mining, production, or synthetic production here) and it was seen as a problem since it's important and a bunch comes from China.  Based on my DD, the stock went dormant since then as they were awaiting business moves.

Just yesterday they made a big announcement with the first U.S. graphite production facility, announced by the governor of Alabama to be in the great state of Alabama near what I understand to be the U.S.'s largest graphite deposit (owned by $WWR I believe).  The plant is not a MINE, the mine is coming later, these guys are buying the mined graphite (not ready for use at all in products) and bringing it up to usable purity, then they plan to bring the mine up to self-feed.

These people are the ONLY people inside the united states producing graphite.  Graphite is one of only 2 forms of carbon found in the earth's crust, the other being diamonds.  Synthetic graphite is possible but currently approx 50% more expensive (just released june 4th 3 weeks ago by white house review) and it's made from coke stockfeed from coal or some shit, but these people at $WWR are also approaching that angle which I like, they can work from mined graphite and also pivot to synthetic graphite if it becomes cheaper.  No one else in the U.S. can produce this stuff.  Anything from 70-200 lbs of graphite per typical car up to like 400 lbs for the new ford lightning.

There are a few other companies like NMG trying to produce graphite, they are all about similar size and nascent, caps in the 50-350m range, WWR is at 170m.  $WWR is the only US, major exchange listed (NYSE) company and tbh it seems more stable and legit where as the other ones seem like hedge fund backed yolos that just shut down in 9 months, this company had actually existed.

Battery production is going to grow in the US especially with Biden's whole $170B EV plan where he plans to make the US the EV leader, I think this shit is really important.  $WWR just happens to be the right company at the right time, getting lucky and benefitting from world events and developments of the economy.  I think this really could be a gem.

The stock's lifetime value graph is classic small company goes bankrupt after a while, similar to all the biotech stocks before corona, or like PLUG, or like WKHS, there are many.  It's a concern of course but again I think right time, these $WWR guys are just lucky, as the other names i listed were, and can rebound successfully off of the $1.5 range, still only approx $5.50 range, having seen $15, and push towards $30-40 as the other names have.","DD: $WWR, WestWater Resources - Graphite (This goes into EV batteries, approx 70-200lbs per car)",1624495681
stocks,"I have been looking at stock trends without buying for a few months, and I’ve noticed some trends.

The trend that stood out to me most was what I think of as a “scoop”. This is probably very elementary stuff, and I’m sure there are technical terms that I am unaware of.

When I say scoop, I mean a stock that ramped up at some point then quickly dropped back down. After that, stocks seem to stay low and keep dropping but at a slower and slower rate. Eventually it evens out and starts to climb back up, usually to about 75% of its previous peak.

So my goal has been to find stocks that just finished leveling out and are starting to “scoop” back up to that 75%.

I have been viewing this trend in 3m, 6m, 1yr, and 5yr ranges because I don’t have an interest in day trading, and I prefer a slower, safer climb.

So I have a few questions:

1. Is this a decent approach?

2. Does it have a name?

3. Are there other good companies out there showing a similar mid-to-long-term trends that I should look into?

stocks,"So, I was doing some research on the Dow and how it functions. I know it is price weighted, therefore higher priced stocks have a greater impact on the Dow’s value than lower priced stocks. 

I began to look through the different companies within the Dow and came across UnitedHealth ($UNH). They are currently trading at $396 per share, which is far and above the rest of the pack. 

Goldman at 360 and Home Depot at 312.. after that it falls off to Microsoft at 265.

Time and time again, I've noticed the discussion is focused on how shorts are causing price drops and initiating ladder attacks. The logical discussion seems to get no traction, meanwhile people are writing essays about complete nonsense. 

What I find most astonishing though is that the percentage of shares shorted is publicly available, and on all of my personal holdings less than 0.5% of the share float is shorted. This obviously discrediting any proposed idea of a short / ladder attack.

The exchange reported short interest is up to 41.27m which is up 2.2% from previous. 49.26% of the current free float is on loan up .5% from 7 days ago. Current cost to borrow = 7.05 with 100% utilization…..100%. Current shares on loan is 55.36m. With today’s listed returned shares at 11.35m.

stocks,"I've been looking for new equities to invest in and Rollins came up. All things considered I decided not to invest in Rollins at current price but wanted to share long summary of brilliant analsysis written by Daniel Schönberger on SA.

 

* Rollins  is an international service company with its headquarters located in  Atlanta. It is providing pest and termite control services through its  wholly-owned subsidiaries to both residential and commercial customers  all over the world. 
* Very stable gross margin and extremely high return on invested capital over the years. 
* Rollins was originally incorporated in 1948 and had its IPO in 1968.  
* Rollins consists of some of the leading pest brands worldwide like Orkin, HomeTeam, Northwest or Western. 
* With  a wide economic moat, a recession-proof business and the family  controlling the majority of voting shares, Rollins is a solid business. 
* All  these brands are providing products and services to protect against  mosquitoes, termites, roaches or ants but also against wildlife (animals  like rats, snakes, skunks or gophers).  
* As  dominant player in the pest and termite services market, Rollins  provides pest (insect and rodent) and termite control services to over  2.4 million residential and commercial customers. 
* When  looking at some of the brands, Orkin is the most important one (it is  employing about 8,000 people) and was already founded in 1901 by  14-year-old Otto Orkin and has more than 100 years of experience in pest  control services specializing in protection against common pests,  including termites, rodents and insects.  
* HomeTeam Pest Defense was established in 1996 and is the number one pest management company providing services to home builders.  
* Clark  Pest Control is the leading pest management company in California and  Northwest Exterminating provides pest control, termite, and wildlife  services for approximately 120,000 customers in Georgia, South Carolina,  Tennessee, Alabama and North Carolina. 
* Stable  revenue and earnings per share growth, which are also hints that we are  dealing with a company that has an economic moat around its business. 
* Although  Rollins has only one reportable segment (the pest and termite control  business), its revenue can be split up in three different business  segments. 
* About  18% of revenue stems from termite control sales (with a retention rate  of about 85%) and about 81% of revenue stems from pest control with  these sales being split up in residential pest control sales  contributing about 42-43% to overall revenue (with about 76% to 85%  retention rate) and about 40% of sales stemming from commercial pest  control (with a retention rate of 88% to 90%). 
* The  biggest part of revenue is generated in the United States. In 2019  about 92% of revenue ($1,863 million) was generated in the United States  with $153 million in revenue stemming from other countries.  
* Rollins  also uses a franchise system (especially Orkin) with more than 200  franchises worldwide in more than 800 locations and is trying to expand  its growth. This program is primarily used in smaller markets where it  is currently not commercially feasible to locate a conventional Orkin  branch.  
* Right now, the international and domestic franchising revenue is less than 1% of the company's revenue. 
* Rollins'  business is affected a little bit by seasonal aspects as revenue is  usually the lowest in the first quarter of the year and the highest in  the second and third quarters. As bugs thrive in warm weather it is not  really a surprise, that revenue for Rollins is the highest in the summer  months.  
* But  aside from the seasonal aspects, Rollins' revenue is extremely stable  and the business is recession-proof to a very high degree. Pest control  is important every year and as termites or bugs don't care about  economic expansions, recessions or the business cycle, customers will  need the products and services of Rollins even in economic downturns. 
* The  fact that Rollins is a recession-proof business can also be seen by  looking at the last quarterly numbers. In the second quarter, total  revenue could increase 5.6% despite a global economic downturn and for  the first half of 2020, revenue could increase even 9.2% and net income  could increase 9.3% (both compared to the same timeframe last year). 
* Rollins  could not only report very stable revenue growth during the last  decade, but the future is also looking bright as the company is  operating in an attractive industry, which will be able to grow in the  mid-single digits in the years to come. 
* Rollins will continue to focus on acquisitions. 
* The  number of households served could be increased in the United States as  currently only about 10 million households are served by Rollins and its  competitors. 
* Aside  from private households, many businesses could also become potential  customers. Increasing regulations could force more and more restaurants,  hotels and similar businesses to use more rigid pest control.  
* Additionally,  Rollins could expand globally. Right now, international revenue is only  contributing about 8% to the business' top line and with more and more  people moving to cities and the rising middle class there are a lot of  potential new customers as the urban middle class are Rollins' target  group. 
* And  as pest generally thrives in warmer climate, global warming could be  another tailwind for the entire industry and also for Rollins (not just  in the United States). 
* The termite damage today is already $5.6 billion annually and this threat to home owner could be even worse in the future. 
* Mosquito products and services could be another strategic growth opportunity, but in 2018 revenue was only $22 million.  
* And  finally, Rollins could increase its revenue by increasing its market  share. Right now, Rollins has a market share of 20% - pretty much the  same as competitor ServiceMaster (SERV)  and although I would not count on it, increasing its market share is  another possibility for increasing revenue in the years to come. 
* Aside  from Terminix - which is the subsidiary of ServiceMaster, that Rollins  is mostly competing with - the main competitors are Rentokil (OTCPK:RKLIF) and Ecolab (ECL). Additionally, Rollins is competing with the Swedish pest control company Anticimex. 
* In  the past, Rollins has acquired many former competitors and will  probably continue to do so in the years to come. This leads to a  consolidation in the business and might not only increase Rollins'  market share, but also make the industry more concentrated, which is  good for Rollins as it gives the company more pricing power due to  reduced competition. 
* The  combination of the industry consolidation by acquisitions and the  relative high market share Rollins has leads to a stable and good  competitive situation for Rollins in the coming years. 
* Due  to its high market share, Rollins (as well as Terminix) can easily  retaliate against new competitors (for example increasing the pressure  on new companies by lowering prices for some time).  
* Overall,  the barriers to entry are not as high as they might be in some other  industries, but they are creating some challenges for new competitors  that are trying to enter the industry. 
* Rollins  also has a highly fragmented customer base with about 2 million  individual customers. The company has not just small individual  households as clients, but even the bigger clients make up only a very  small percentage of total revenue. The largest national accounts make up  less than 3% of the revenue. This high level of fragmentation gives  Rollins bargaining power over its customers. 
* Despite  the fact that customers can switch to competitors, it is very hard for  individual customers to put pressure on Rollins. Threatening to switch  to a competitor won't make much difference for Rollins as long as it is  just one individual customer.  
* The  product differentiation and the customer relations will also lead to  some form of bargaining power over the customers and are decreasing the  willingness to switch. 
* Another  important aspect is the fact that Rollins is a classical family  business and usually these types of business are very successful and  provide high levels of stability and consistency in its operations.  
* Rollins  was not only founded by two brothers in 1948 - John W. Rollins and O.  Wayne Rollins - but is currently also run by two brothers. 
* Family  members are not only holding key management positions within the  company, but the Rollins family is also controlling about 55% of the  voting shares.  
* The  fact that the family has the voting power and is controlling key  management positions is usually a good sign for the company and its  shareholders as it is leading to stability and consistency. 
* Rollins  has certainly established a wide economic moat in its industry and this  moat is based on two aspects - the brand name on the one hand and cost  advantages on the other hand. 
* When talking about the brand name it is not so much Rollins as brand, but rather the subsidiaries - and especially Orkin.  
* The  brand name is leading to pricing power and Rollins can increase prices  every single year (every year in June, the company implements its  traditional price increase program and is increasing prices at least  1%). 
* The  brand name is certainly a short cut and is making the buying decision  for customers easier. Maybe it is also increasing the willingness to pay  a higher price. 
* The  economic moat is not just based on the brand name, but also on cost  advantages for Rollins. These cost advantages are mostly based on the  fact that Rollins is one of the two market leaders in a small niche it  is operating in. 
* As  the total pest control market is a smaller market, it might not be so  lucrative for big corporations and therefore Rollins is not confronted  with that kind of competition. In its small niche market, Rollins has  almost unmatched scale and it helps the company to be more efficient in  deploying certain fixed costs (such as training or marketing expenses). 
* During  the financial crisis, Rollins could increase revenue in 2008 as well as  in 2009. In 2008 revenue could increase 14.0% and in 2009 Rollins could  increase its revenue 5.2%. But Rollins could not only increase revenue,  but also net income could grow 6.5% in 2008 and 21.8% in 2009. 
* When  looking at the recession after the Dotcom bubble, we see a similar  picture although growth was not as high. In 2001, revenue could increase  0.5% and in 2002, revenue could increase 2.4% (net income also  increased in both years). 
* For  the last decade, Rollins could increase its revenue with a CAGR of  6.56% and net income with a CAGR of 9.22%. But when looking at the  long-term performance since 1980, revenue increased ""only"" 4.24%  annually on average and net income increased 4.61% annually an average.  
* Rollins  is certainly a good business, which could make a good long-term  investment. The business is not only recession-proof, but is also  controlled by the Rollins family and has a very stable management team.  It also has a wide economic moat around its business and growth  potential in the years to come.

So I skipped those and continued on the list till I had the top 10 public companies.  Also, the formatting is hard so I just included total results for each period and the total for all 5 periods.  I did not include dividends.  

This is not perfect, but just for fun.  I based the results on the begining and ending share price.  It's not weighted in any way, just percent gain (or loss) for each company during that period.  Same for SPY.

I spoke with many folks about it and they all seemed to have this bias. In fact taking small losses does not equal to losing money. There’s no way you can become a profitable trader if you are not ready to be wrong anytime you make a bet.

The key is how fast you understand your emotional trap and find a system to stick to it as much as you can. Self control is like a muscle you’ll develop it with time. It’s easier said than done. I continuously made errors on the market before I began to simply put stop loss and take profit. But this is simple enough to start. I followed recommendations from the traders I've found on thiq qooore app and set up everything without checking it try minute. This is good for beginners, before you start digging deeper into the books. I gradually changed my perspective and traded weeks after weeks sticking to the plan training my discipline.

**Why KPLT is undervalued and overlooked?**

Katapult Holdings (KPLT) is a financing platform that focuses on non-prime, online customers. KPLT is the leading “buy now, pay later” service with dirt cheap evaluation and potential to grow. KPLT is very profitable, has quick growth potential, and is trading for much less than its peers.

**Why will KPLT grow?**

The Federal Reserve Bank of New York states that 38% of US consumers are non-prime. That’s a huge market Katapult to grow off of. With Katapult being partnered with merchants like Wayfair, Motorola, Purple, Nectar, and Lenovo, Katapult already has their foot in the door to sell to non-prime consumers.

When a consumer fails a prime lending application from companies like Affirm or PayPal, they are passed on to Katapult. Katapult offers them different kinds of payment options depending on what they can afford.

*Katapult is the only nonprime consumer POS lease financing platform focused on e-commerce.*

Currently, Katapult is the only major non-prime financing platform that is focused primarily online. With Katapult integrated into merchant sites, having very little competition, and open to a large market, it has lots of growth potential.

**KPLT financials**

Katapult approves around 60% of consumers who failed prime lender applications. There is higher risk when dealing with non-prime customers. Fortunately, the company has less than a 3% fraud rate and recovers around 90% of lease costs and charge-offs.

**Earnings**

In 2019, KPLT earned $92M in revenue. In 2020 they had $250M in revenue. Analysts project more gains in the upcoming years:

\-2021: $455M

\-2022: $799M

\-2023: $1,133M

KPLT earnings seem underwhelming for 2019, but we see lots of growth in 2020 and good projected growth for the upcoming years.

Another good factor contributing to KPLT growth is the indexed return on leases. In 2019, Katapult lease return improved from 28% to 35%. In 2020, it rose to 40%. Katapult’s earnings will keep growing due to its increased return on leases. The more they squeeze out of their leases, is the more profits and income they’ll net.

**Growth**

“Buy now, Pay later” transactions are gaining much more popularity. Juniper Research suggests that BNPL transactions will grow from $226B in 2021 to $995B by 2026. More than 50% of Americans use BNPL transactions as of March 2021. The BNPL market is growing at a rapid rate. With little competition among non-prime financing platforms, Katapult will skyrocket.

KPLT is expecting $1B in revenue by 2023, and is aggressively expanding its retail partners. KPLT added 26 new retail partners in Q1 and will keep growing its market.

**Conclusion**

KPLT is very, very undervalued at a little over $10. Its projected earnings are growing at a rapid rate. With KPLT greatly increasing the amount of retail partners and with the growing BNPL market, Katapult is a great investment that will have lots of return.

I think KPLT should be trading at around $20 or more. Don’t take my word on it, I’m not a financial advisor and you should definitely do some of your own DD. I hope this can bring some awareness to a criminally undervalued stock that hold lots of short and long term profits.",KPLT Undervalued - Big Potential Growth (DD),1624481838

Venmo has been looking to capitalize on this kind of commercial activity while preserving the ability for friends to freely pay one another.

stocks,"**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, June 23, 2021** 

Stocks rose again today, as inflationary concerns continue to abate, with the Nasdaq (QQQ) powering to record a new fresh intraday high driven by the continued rallies in mega-cap tech stocks like Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and Apple (AAPL). The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) continues to hover 2-3 points below its record high while the Dow Jones (DIA) continues to recover after suffering its worst performance since October 2020 last week. 

In a meeting with the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell once again reiterated that interest rates will not be raised on inflation fears alone and sees current pressures as transitory. Powell said, “We will not raise interest rates preemptively because we fear the possible onset of inflation. We will wait for evidence of actual inflation or other imbalances.” He went on to further say recent price increases “don’t speak to a broadly tight economy that would require higher interest rates” but come from factors “directly affected by the reopening”. Powell then went on to further reiterate the Central Bank is keeping a close eye on a “broad set of labor market statistics” before any adjustment to the current policy is considered. He said “We will not just look at the headline numbers for unemployment. We will look at all kinds of measures…. That is the most important thing we can do to ensure the benefits of the recovery are more fully shared”. 

As expected, response by lawmakers to Powell’s testimony, no surprise, split squarely down partisan lines, with Democrats focusing on labor market imbalances and unemployment and Republicans focusing on concerns surrounding inflation. I do not place much, if any, weight on what was said by lawmakers, just interested in what Powell had to say. 

Looking ahead, market participants are gearing up for Q2 earnings, with analysts expecting a repeat of Q1 record setting season, with earnings expected to continue being super-charged by stronger than expected demand by savings-laden consumers as the US economy is finally open to begin broadly reopening thanks to effective distribution of the vaccine.  So far, analysts are looking for S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 61.9% year-on-year in aggregate, according to FactSet data – an estimate UBS's Head of Equity Derivatives Research Stuart Kaiser said may still be ""need to be revised higher."" 

Moreover, tomorrow Thursday  the Fed is set to release the results of its “stress test” on the US largest banks, an annual test meant to test the financial health of lenders that was instituted following the 2009 financial crisis. The tests are designed to see how banks would fare during a hypothetical extreme economic downturn (not unlike what banks experienced last year). This stress test is extremely important because last year, during the height of the pandemic, the Fed imposed restrictions on banks on capital distributions like dividends and buybacks in order to ensure banks would have enough capital to weather the storm. Thanks to those measures, plus low interest rates and government stimulus that held off loan losses, analysts expect banks to perform well on Thursday, which would lead the Fed to lift remaining capital distribution curbs, opening the floodgates for banks to increase dividends and reinstitute stock buy back programs. If these restrictions are fully lifted, the six largest banks in the US - Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup, Goldman Sachs (GS), JP Morgan (JPM), Morgan Stanley (MS) and Wells Fargo (WFC) - are expected to increase payouts by $66 billion to $130 billion over the next four quarters. This is huge.

On Friday, Later this week, investors will receive the latest update on core personal consumption expenditures (PCE), which serves as the Fed's preferred gauge of inflation. The report due for release on Friday is expected to register a 3.4% year-on-year increase for May, marking the fastest jump since 1992, albeit while still reflecting ""base effects"" as prices rebound after last year's pandemic-induced collapse in prices across the board

AMC has 450m outstanding shares right now, while GME has 70M (disclosed shares I found on Google)\*. The price for AMC is nearing the price of GME, but GME just seems to have better foundations right now, so I'm confused as to why it's sitting around $200 while AMC is sitting around $60. 

GME has 1.8 billion in cash right now with zero debt to play around with, tons of future plans, and just a stronger base imo. I think AMC had 1.5 billion with a billion debt (I think I heard this on Aaron stream), is planning on eventually buying out other theatre chains, and they've given shareholders a bucket of medium popcorn (one per shareholder, not per stock). 

This is current earning though, and people are really just interested in the short squeeze coming up. Which company is more set up for the better squeeze? I've heard rumors GME owns their float multiple times over, while AMC claims they own 80% of it. Will the vote for 50m shares impact AMC at all?

Dear *Retirement Millionaire* subscriber,

The young woman succumbed to cervical cancer in 1951... But part of her is still alive.

She spent nine months in treatment, and for the last two months, she never left Baltimore's Johns Hopkins Hospital.

She underwent radium treatments – the best technology available at the time – but it wasn't enough to stop the tenacious cancer.

When cancer researcher George Gey received a sample of her biopsy, he noticed something unusual. While most cancer cells died within a few days in laboratories, this patient's cells continued doubling every 20 to 24 hours.

#### Portfolio Snapshot

That meant that researchers could use the same cells for a series of experiments, and the supply was almost unlimited.

Dr. Gey called them HeLa cells, an anonymized contraction of the patient's name, Henrietta Lacks. Johns Hopkins offered HeLa cells freely for scientific research. And in the following decades, those cells – multiplied and divided many times – were used to develop the polio vaccine... used to study leukemia, AIDS, and cancer... and even tested in the zero gravity of space.

While Johns Hopkins gave away the cells freely, others repackaged and customized them for research, sometimes selling them for thousands of dollars per vial.

And given that these cells live on, Lacks' DNA continues to operate in living cells – 70 years later – and has contributed to countless breakthroughs, cures, and lives improved.

The story came to national fame with a 2010 bestselling book called *The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks*. It was more recently turned into a feature film starring Oprah Winfrey. And many of the beneficiaries of Lacks' amazing cells have given donations to various foundations in her name.

Lacks and her family – working-class African Americans who were living under segregation – never agreed to share her biopsy with medical researchers. It was decades before any of her survivors learned about HeLa cells. And they never received any compensation.

The medical accomplishments that resulted from HeLa cells will always suffer this tinge of Henrietta Lacks' exploitation.

But early last year, another patient donated valuable cells – knowingly, this time. Those cells were spun up into a lifesaving treatment that aided hundreds of thousands of people during the current pandemic.

Though we'll likely never know his or her name, this patient's natural immune system developed an antibody to COVID-19. It was scooped out of millions of cells in his or her bloodstream, identified, replicated, and delivered to others suffering from the respiratory disease to prevent the virus's serious symptoms.

This was made possible by an incredible new platform – from a new, recently public firm – that can change the process of discovering antibodies. Today, we'll explain why this company is so promising, and why we'll be able to get shares at a one-time discount if we buy right now.

#### Why a Platform Is Better Than a Drug

So many biotech investors bet on drugs getting through trials...

After all, that's the name of the game, isn't it? Drugs get through trials, start selling, and make money.

A biotech company with a drug that just passed trials is by definition more valuable than it was a day before, when the drug was still a gamble.

If you can find those drugs, predict approvals, and capture the surge in value, you will do well.

But catching those approvals is incredibly difficult. Even if you know the science, read all the results, and talk to experts, it's nearly impossible to know which drugs will pass trials. Even then, you have to know something the market doesn't, or share prices will already account for the likely outcomes.

We often think about it this way... The biotech companies working on the drugs have dozens of highly educated scientists who have worked on this single treatment, sometimes for decades. They know more about it than anyone in the world. *And even they don't know if it's going to pass trials*.

We have these trials precisely because we are trying to discover new information that was fundamentally unknowable until it's scientifically tested.

Rather than bet on a single drug with hugely expensive trials, we want to bet on a *platform* for discovering drugs.

We found a firm that isn't betting on a single drug... but nearly 200.

It doesn't have to fund expensive trials... but it gets paid to do its research.

And if it has a success... it can still earn big streams of drug royalties.

It's as if all the biotech companies are out searching for a needle in a haystack, and this company is selling them a giant magnet – with a right to partial ownership of any needles found.

And it had its first huge success in the depths of the pandemic...

#### A World-Class Drug in Under 90 Days

**AbCellera Biologics (Nasdaq: ABCL)** is a drug-discovery platform. It's not a pharmaceutical company itself. Rather, it helps pharma companies identify potential drugs, specifically antibodies.

We'll admit, when we started reading up on AbCellera, we were skeptical... On its website, it bills itself as a ""Full-Stack AI-Powered Antibody Discovery Platform."" Without results, that's nothing more than buzzword soup.

But it turns out the science is there.

Our immune systems design antibody proteins to attack things that shouldn't be in our bodies – like cancer cells, bacteria, or viruses. There's currently a boom in the science behind finding these antibodies when they are produced and using them to fight diseases. The market for antibodies currently tops $140 billion, and it's expected to grow to $261 billion by 2025.

But it's not easy to find them.

By full-stack, AbCellera means it can take antibody development from the first sample all the way to finding an antibody that can work as a drug. Its process starts with proprietary ""microfluidics"" that allow it to separate cells from a sample, and it goes on to artificial intelligence (""AI"") computer-vision technology that can look at proteins and judge whether they may be a viable antibody.

This process saved lives in 2020.

AbCellera knew that the urgency of COVID-19 would make a great use of its technology, and it entered a partnership with Eli Lilly (LLY) to develop a SARS-CoV-2 antibody.

In February 2020, on what we'll count as ""Day Zero,"" AbCellera received a sample from one of the first U.S. patients to get COVID-19. That patient is our new Henrietta Lacks... because his or her antibodies ended up treating hundreds of thousands of people.

AbCellera used its advanced microfluidics system to isolate and screen 5.8 million cells from that sample. (This is the haystack we are looking in.) This is not easy. But AbCellera's technology allows researchers to use a device the size of a credit card with more than a half-million miniature chambers to separate cells.

Then the company identified 2,200 candidates that looked like spike-protein antibodies and eventually got 500 monoclonal antibodies out of that.

We're already down to less than 0.008% of the cells from the original sample. But at 500 candidates, that's still too many drugs to test.

That's where AbCellera's image-recognition AI came in. The system analyzed those 500 candidates and isolated 24 that were worthy of human testing. Those candidates got sent off to Eli Lilly.

From sample to delivery to Eli Lilly, AbCellera took only 23 days. That's simply a mind-blowing number.

Eli Lilly needed less than two months to take AbCellera's candidates into human trials. And what came out of it was a drug called bamlanivimab. It was approved in 15 countries and treated more than 400,000 COVID patients.

The drug brought Eli Lilly $871 million in revenue in the fourth quarter of 2020 alone. (Now Eli Lilly pairs bamlanivimab with another antibody for a more potent treatment.)

The most recent study tests the combination of bamlanivimab with another antibody and shows that high-risk patients saw an 87% reduction in hospitalizations and deaths. The study of 511 patients treated saw *zero* deaths, compared with 13 deaths in the 258 treated with a placebo.

With COVID-19 treatment getting better in general and vaccinations on the rise, it's likely that bamlanivimab sales will ease off. While it was a great financial success for AbCellera, the drug probably won't be part of its long-term future.

That's fine with us. AbCellera is currently working on more than 100 projects with major partners.

When investing in biotech stocks, the biggest question is whether the promised technology is a viable product or just a scientist's wishful thinking.

Bamlanivimab is the first drug to go through AbCellera's full process... so as of right now, its success rate is 100%.

If AbCellera's platform can repeatedly find those needles in the haystack, it's going to be a huge success. Fortunately, we've found compelling evidence that it can replicate this success...

#### Some Votes in Its Favor

One of the most striking signs of potential success for AbCellera is its list of partners.

It has ongoing development projects with a stellar list of big-time, successful pharma companies and organizations. In addition to Eli Lilly, these include...

* Gilead Sciences (GILD)
* Novartis (NVS)
* GlaxoSmithKline (GSK)
* Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (TEVA)
* Sanofi (SNY)
* Pfizer (PFE)
* Merck (MRK)
* Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN)
* Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (""DARPA"")
* Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation

AbCellera now has 119 projects under development – up 63% from last year. It's working with skilled drug developers. While they are well-versed in taking risks to develop drugs, they also have the experience and know-how to determine what technologies stand a good chance of helping them.

The science itself also offers clues to success.

For one, you can pluck natural antibodies from the immune system like AbCellera does, or you can attempt to create them from scratch. The natural way works best, with 92% of approved antibody drugs coming from natural immune systems.

To further the success of the COVID-19 antibody, AbCellera found another antibody, called LY-CoV1404, that may work better against more variants of the virus. The company announced in May it was headed to clinical trials.

But perhaps the biggest clue comes from the roster of investors we'll be sitting alongside...

#### The Smartest Guys in the Room

Biotech investing is hard, but specialists can earn incredible returns. And those specialists can help you find the best places to invest.

We've found that the best investors love AbCellera.

The top biotech investors in the world are Julian and Felix Baker, who run Baker Bros. Advisors.

As of a 2019 profile in Bloomberg, they had amassed $3.8 billion in personal wealth, almost entirely from biotech investing. The fund they ran had grown to $17 billion. They've had huge, multibillion-dollar gains in companies like Seagen (SGEN), also known as Seattle Genetics, and BeiGene (BGNE).

As the CEO of one of its investments explained, ""You come out of your first meeting with them, you go 'wow' and you're drenched in sweat. Not every investor is so well-prepared.""

Another fund called OrbiMed Advisors does nearly as well and is perennially listed in the top biotech venture capital firms. The public, London-listed Biotech Growth Trust (BIOG.L) it manages (which is separate from its main funds) has returned 1,200% over the past 15 years, versus 832% for biotech firms in general and just 137% for the overall U.K. stock market.

While not specializing in biotech, Peter Thiel is an outspoken and independent billionaire who dominates Silicon Valley. He got rich as a co-founder of PayPal and then moved on to be an early investor in other now-famous ventures like Facebook, SpaceX, and Spotify.

*All* of these guys are early – and sizable – investors in AbCellera. In many cases, it makes up an outsized investment in their funds. (Another legendary biotech fund, Perceptive Advisors, was an early investor as well.)

And while many biotech firms can claim one of these storied investors, not many have attracted capital from all three.

Here's what we think when we see these investors...

First, they are smart. They know biotech. They know what works and what doesn't, and they know what businesses can step in and fill the gaps that other biotechnology companies can use. If they think AbCellera has a future, so do we.

Furthermore, given their connections, they can help to introduce their other portfolio holdings to AbCellera's platform – providing a source of new customers.

#### What Royalty Streams Can Mean

AbCellera gets paid in a few ways...

It gets payments up front when it partners with a drug company, and then milestone payments as it delivers antibody candidates or as drug trials complete. These payments are great for keeping the research proceeding and lowering AbCellera's risk.

But the biggest riches will come from the royalty stake that AbCellera retains in any drugs that come to market.

The terms of the deals are not disclosed, but by comparing the bamlanivimab results reported by Eli Lilly and AbCellera, it looks like AbCellera collected something like 15% or 20%.

If AbCellera can work on 119 (and counting) projects and take 20% from them, those streams are going to start stacking up on each other in a big way.

We don't know how successful the platform will be in the long run, but let's say it has a 10% success rate. (To be clear, we're expecting much higher.) Then let's also say that the drugs it finds are about half as successful, financially, as bamlanivimab and earn $500 million per year.

That would put the future revenue on its current batch of projects at $4 billion per year. The stocks in the Nasdaq Biotech Index are currently valued at 7.7 times sales, which would put AbCellera at a market cap of $30 billion, an increase of more than 300% from today's $6.8 billion.

We're only painting a rough outline, but the point is to demonstrate that the effect of cumulative royalties could turn out to be massive. We'd much rather own 15% to 20% of 119 projects than 100% of one or two drugs in trials.

#### By the Numbers

While the science will determine AbCellera's success, we'll still review the financials.

Prior to the successful commercialization of bamlanivimab, the company had little income. But in the last two quarters, AbCellera brought in $200 million in sales per quarter, up from $4.7 million in the first quarter of 2020.

That makes for a huge $105 million in cash flow in the most recent quarter.

But it won't hold up. Analysts expect sales to fall off dramatically. Fortunately, AbCellera's cash burn is sustainable. Most of its expenses come attached to certain projects and are funded by specific payments from partners. The company has a huge $686 million in cash on hand, which can fund years of operations.

Currently valued at about $6.8 billion, it certainly sports a hefty price for a firm that's still mostly a speculative bet on what it can do in the future. At the same time, it has created an incredible amount of value since it was founded in 2012. With a little more success, excitement can ramp up still further for this startup.

#### Why Today Is the Perfect Day to Buy AbCellera

On the heels of its success developing bamlanivimab, AbCellera went public via an initial public offering (""IPO"") in December.

The company sold 27.7 million shares and raised $555 million to fund the development of the business.

And those big-name early investors we mentioned earlier are sitting on hundreds of millions of dollars in publicly traded shares.

However, they couldn't sell. IPOs typically come with a ""lock-up period,"" an agreement made by certain early investors that they won't sell their shares for a specified period of time after the offering. This is supposed to give new investors confidence that early investors won't dump their shares and send down the price during the first few important months the stock trades.

The lock-up for AbCellera expired today, June 9. Insiders can now sell.

Common wisdom suggests you don't want to own shares of an IPO as the lock-up expires, since some early investors will undoubtedly sell shares and put downward pressure on the price.

However, a careful study of IPO results shows that on average, stocks decline *until* the lock-up day, then start to trade up after that. It appears that the market anticipates the end of lock-up, but by the time insiders can sell, shares are ready to rise again.

And shares dipped down sharply as the lock-up approached...

📷

That makes June 10, the day after lock-up, the perfect day to buy AbCellera.

Of course, we can't be certain that AbCellera will follow the same pattern precisely. Shares could decline for any number of reasons, insider selling included. However, we're looking at this as long-term investors with a bit of short-term evidence on our side.

Also, to be clear, you can't time any investment precisely. While June 10 is *statistically* the best time to buy, you don't have to rush out and buy this second. Any time in June, or even any time this year, should be a great time to buy AbCellera. But it never hurts to carefully study the history.

What we'll be watching closer is... what do those early investors we like to follow do? We see it as likely that Baker Bros., OrbiMed, and Peter Thiel will sell shares in the coming months. And their selling may push the share price down in the short term – but what does it mean for the long term?

Investors have a lot of reasons to sell that have nothing to do with the prospects of AbCellera. These guys put in a little money that turned into a lot of money. It's only natural to take profits.

Besides, given AbCellera's huge growth, it's an oversized position in many of their portfolios.

If these investors decide to pare down their holdings to be in line with the rest of their portfolios, that would be a reasonable decision even if they want to hold on for continued gains.

If these investors take the first opportunity to sell their positions to zero and get out of the company completely, we'd be less encouraged. But we'd be shocked if it happened.

Most of these investors need to report their buying and selling activities on a quarterly basis, with reports on the quarter ending June 30 due on August 16. And Thiel has to file a report within two days of any transactions. We'll report back on any important news from their filings.

But whatever the big investors do, they've already pointed us to a biotech startup with outstanding prospects and technology that seems like a sci-fi dream.

In a best-case scenario, if its platform continues to work as well as it did on COVID-19 antibodies, this little-known startup could be one of the world's biggest biotech firms.

If it only works half that well, it will still be worth multiple times its current value.

We'll name this as one of our rare speculations in *Retirement Millionaire*. We tend to be conservative with our capital, but taking a more aggressive position when the facts warrant it is what turns your portfolio from a stalwart to a star.

stocks,"Hello people of r/stocks! Recently there has been a push to promote CLNE on WSB but I think the members of this community should be our targets. I’ve been seeing so many people say CLNE “to the moon” or stress about one bad day of trading and if you’re looking for the “next” AMC you’re not being realistic by buying into CLNE. This is a company that is still trying to build its infrastructure, and major changes like converting freight from diesel to RNG will take time. I am very optimistic about this stock though due to the Amazon warrant and previous stocks that had warrants executed under this circumstance.


I’m a certified idiot so take all of this information with that in mind but three companies that Amazon previously executed warrants for make me believe the growth potential for this could be very enticing in the long term.


KRNT had a warrant price of $13.03 and it’s value as I type this is $119

PLUG had a $1.20 warrant and at the time of execution it was valued at $60(now at $34.25)

ATSG had a warrant for $9.73 and at the time of execution it was at $30(now at $23.24)


With CLNE’s warrant being at $13.49 and Amazon’s investment track record I’m feeling very comfortable just buying and holding as the company continues to develop it’s infrastructure and I think anyone that is looking for long term gains should do some research into this stock.

TLDR: CLNE is an undervalued stock that in my opinion is a buy and HODL. It has been making big pushes to solidify its infrastructure and has added valuable partners in Amazon and BP.


I am not a financial adviser and take this post with that discretion in mind.

What makes them a long term buy: They’re competitive among much bigger firms ($KO and $PEP) (think $AMD vs. $INTC). They’ve been consistently increasing market share and profitability. They’re more vertically integrated than competitors: They own both the production and distribution facilities.

They’re actually profitable with a good long term track record (unlike a lot of other companies being hawked on here). They pay dividends (but not always regularly), and have decent P/E at 25.47 (which is better than KO and the industry average). While slightly less than average EPS at $1.83 is good, it’s better than KO, and they have had huge EPS growth at 42% in the last 12 months. FIZZ has a 16% profit margin while PEP is only 10%. Last but not least, they have almost no long term debt!

Technically FIZZ has been a steady gainer as well, with 82.7% 12-month price performance and 20% 6-month price performance. They had a 2:1 split at the end of February this year after paying out an enormous $6 per share! special dividend at the end of January.

Earnings is coming up 29 JUN. It’s expected to go down compared to last quarter, but a surprise beat might give the price a bump. Worth noting here that they’ve beat earnings estimates on the last 5/6 periods.

Upstart’s AI model leverages over 1,000 variables and advanced machine learning algorithms to enable more accurate risk-based pricing and greater automation. With Upstart, bank and credit union partners can approve up to 3x the number of borrowers at the same loss rates as traditional FICO score-based models1 with near-zero default rates2. In addition, Upstart offers an all-digital lending experience to borrowers allowing them to apply from any device at any time with over 70%3 of funded loans being fully automated with no human interaction.

As a result of integration with NXTsoft’s APIs, financial institutions will now be able to more quickly integrate Upstart’s AI platform into their existing services. NXTsoft’s OmniConnect has established API connectivity to 99% of all U.S-based core systems and can provide API connectivity between these core systems and any ancillary fintech solution. NXTsoft has been in the API marketspace for over 25 years and has numerous partners and over 1,000 financial institutions that currently utilize its OmniConnect secure API solution to transmit data real-time between core systems and ancillary applications.

“We want to help our bank and credit union partners quickly and successfully deploy Upstart to lend to more creditworthy borrowers through a modern, all-digital experience,” said Michael Lock, senior vice president of lending partnerships for Upstart. “NXTsoft offers Upstart-powered banks and credit unions a proven approach to integrate our AI lending platform into their existing core systems and workflow to accelerate time to value and be in market with a new offering for their customers.”

Upstart was created to help solve the massive inefficiencies in the credit market. For thirty years, the industry has relied on credit scores and a handful of variables to make lending decisions, resulting in very inaccurate assessments of a borrower’s true credit worth. As a result, only 48%4 of consumers in the U.S. have access to prime credit even though 80% of them have never defaulted on a loan. This disparity is a direct result of the limited information available to financial institutions to make better credit assessments.

“Upstart’s mission is to enable effortless credit based on true risk, and NXTsoft’s mission is to enable effortless connectivity between Fintech and financial institutions,” said David Brasfield, CEO of NXTsoft. “NXTsoft is excited to partner with Upstart to streamline and scale their ability to onboard new partners to their smarter, AI-based credit decisioning that facilitates a modern, all-digital lending experience.”",UPST with a new partnership,1624454253

today i will be writing about alibaba stock ""BABA"" and exlplain my thesis regarding the underlying.

# intro:

Alibaba Group Holding Limited operates various segments including : core commerce, cloud, digital media, entertainment, payment services...

business which Alibaba group own: Taobao, TMALL, Freshipo, Lazada, Ali-express, Alibaba, ele,me, 1688, youku, alibaba-cloud, alimama, cainiao network, dingtalk, ant group, ali-pay

Alibaba group does business in almost every thing you can imagine, therfore you can compare them to every big tech you know, they stand with the big dogs.(AMZN, GOOG, AAPL, MSFT) but they get less attention at the moment.  i think the sentiment towards alibaba is bound to change, very soon.

**Why BABA ?, why now ?**

baba showed negative performance relative to the other tech stocks at the moment (market sentiment due to politics - alot of impact on the stock) . but baba strength can be seen in a few areas: revenue growth, solid financial position with reasonable debt and very reasonable and cheap valuation. the profit margins are lower when comparing to peers right now but baba business have much to grow and much to be expected to fix that issue.

Baba stock experienced little decline in most recent quarter in comparison to performance from same quarter a year before, but i think the next earning this year will reveal growth in EPS.

Now, lets start of with the basics and take a look on baba financial and valuation.

At BABA current stock price of $211, the market is expecting revenue to grow at 48.8% for the next 1 years. Over this period, BABA is also expected to generate an average Economic Earnings Margin of 13.8%

Baba have increased theirlong term debt looking at their financials but due to increase in future revenue i believe it is nothing to be bothered by. debt is not an real issue to baba.

\*\*very important note is that comparing baba to other big techs valuations at the moment proves that baba is dirty cheap and can be a good short/long term play . even is market goes sideways i dont see baba going any lower than right now. 200 price is pretty strong ressitence and still a good price.

revenue growth: 47.96%

eps growth : 14.42%

i will be including a look into baba Assets and Liabilities, which i believe is showing us a healthy company which keep growing and expanding and inceasing their cashflow, revenue and shareholders equity.

# Technicals:

52wk High: 319.32

52wk Low: 204.39

Avg volume (3M) : 15.8M -&gt; breakout will increase volume obiously everybody watching the stock movement right now.

baba is down \~33% from the top at 319.32 (10/27/21).

I expect to see a bullish breakout in a couple days, can be happening anytime right now. good support at 209-210 level, every time we get there i can spot large money flowing into baba.

I believe that a price of 300$ before the year ends is possible and quite easy with a very little catalyst or sentiment change towards the company. right now from what im reviewing the sentiment towards baba is starting to chagne across the internet and financial market.

Single-game sports betting is set to become legal in Canada after Bill C-218, the Safe and Regulated Sports Betting Act, was [officially passed](https://www.parl.ca/legisinfo/BillDetails.aspx?Language=E&amp;billId=10866122) in the Senate of Canada on Tuesday.

The private member's bill - sponsored by Conservative MP Kevin Waugh (Saskatoon-Grasswood) - passed without amendment, by a vote of 57 to 20 (five abstentions). Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Liberal government will decide on a date when the legalization of single-game sports betting will take effect.

The bill signals a major shift in Canada: single-game sports betting has been legal in the country but only via parlay wagers. Canadians will now have the ability to bet on single-game matches across sports (excluding horse racing), with the government set to collect taxes on estimated billions of dollars currently being wagered illegally.

Waugh issued a [statement](https://kevinwaugh.ca/mp-waugh-statement-on-passage-of-single-sports-betting-bill-in-the-senate/) Tuesday evening celebrating the passage of the bill, calling it ""a victory for Canadian sport, sport fans, and businesses."" He added:

&gt;Following this legislation becoming law, provincial governments will be responsible for implementing regulations and wagering operators in their jurisdictions. I call on provincial governments to act as quickly as possible to get the necessary regulations and licenses in place so that all Canadians can begin to place their wagers.",Canadian Single-sports Betting Approved by the Senate,1624404281

Here’s my DD. 


I’ve had 6 iPhones in the past 5 years. 


My first two I didn’t use an Otterbox and the screen cracked or the lcd stopped working. 


Fast forward to when I got my first credit card and decided to buy the new iPhone 8 Plus. I said. Hmm. I need a good case this time. Lol it was my money now. So I got the Otterbox bc well, I thought they were the best and they weren’t as bulky as they used to be. 

Fast forward to 30 minutes ago and 4 iPhones later to where I dropped my iPhone 12 Pro face first on concrete, and it didn’t even scratch the fucking screen protector. Between these past few years my phone has been dropped, ran over, thrown a couple times (god darn it GME) lol. But nothing. 0 problems. 

I did the best math I could:

iPhone 6 Plus 
screen 3 times - $90 x 3 = $270
lcd 1 - $150 

iPhone 7 Plus $90-130
screen 2 times - $110 x 2 = $220
lcd 2 times - $150 x 2 = $300

It’s last leg took me on a wild $300 ride between 5 stores to be told I was SOL. I could’ve gotten the warrant but it was all the shxt I had stored on the phone that I cared about! 
(I still have it.. one day) 

$1240 for the first two iphones 

Based on the average for the past 2 phones I did just a little less being that I’ve had these 4 phones in a 3 year time span compared to 2 phones in 2 years. 

iPhone 8 Plus
2 screen - $169 x 2 = $338 
1 lcd - $150


iPhone 11 Pro 
2 screen - $279 x 2 = $558
1 lcd - $150


iPhone se
2 screen - $100 x 2 = $200
1 lcd  - $150


iPhone 12 Pro
2 screen - $279 = $558
1 lcd - $150


Screen - $1645
Lcd -$600
Total estimated saved - $2245 every 4 years or $561.25 every year. 

I am almost 25 years old. 
If I continue this trend, then I would have about 30 more phones throughout my life. 

So I’ve already save $2245
30 x $561.25 = $16,837.50
Total = $19,082.50
Round it up to $20,000.

stocks,"What are everyone's thoughts on the Doximity IPO? They are supposed to be going public this week. This company really looks hot to trot, at least to me. Already profitable, Millions in revenue, and fast-growing telehealth segment.  Valuation seems pretty reasonable. Used as a sort of LinkedIn for 80% of US doctors, so it seems like the healthcare community has greater trust in it than other Telehealth providers. Honestly looks like a great future potential buyout target by Teladoc. Would love to hear some more opinions though. That is why I am bringing this to the virtual water-cooler that is reddit.

The stock market rose again today, driven by a continued rally in tech stocks and tempered inflationary fears. The Nasdaq (QQQ) reached a fresh record high for the second time this week and the Dow Jones (DIA) continues to recover following its worst week since October 2020. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) closed 0.54% higher and is two points away from its record high. With earnings for Q2 fast approaching, market participants are gearing up for what is expected to be a repeat of Q1 record-setting season, with earnings expected to continue being super-charged by stronger than expected demand from savings-loaden consumers and the continued reopening of the US economy thanks to effective distribution of the coronavirus vaccine. So far, analysts are looking for S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 61.9% year-on-year in aggregate, according to FactSet data – an estimate UBS's Head of Equity Derivatives Research Stuart Kaiser said may still be ""need to be revised higher."" 

Today, in a meeting with the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell once again reiterated that interest rates will not be raised on inflation fears alone and sees current pressures as transitory. Powell said, “We will not raise interest rates preemptively because we fear the possible onset of inflation. We will wait for evidence of actual inflation or other imbalances.” He went on to further say recent price increases “don’t speak to a broadly tight economy that would require higher interest rates” but come from factors “directly affected by the reopening”. Powell then went on to further reiterate the Central Bank is keeping a close eye on a “broad set of labor market statistics” before any adjustment to the current policy is considered. He said “We will not just look at the headline numbers for unemployment. We will look at all kinds of measures…. That is the most important thing we can do to ensure the benefits of the recovery are more fully shared”. 

As expected, response by lawmakers to Powell’s testimony, no surprise, split squarely down partisan lines, with Democrats focusing on labor market imbalances and unemployment and Republicans focusing on concerns surrounding inflation. I do not place much, if any, weight on what was said by lawmakers, just interested in what Powell had to say. 

On Thursday, the Fed is set to release the results of its “stress test” on the US largest banks, an annual test meant to test the financial health of lenders that was instituted following the 2009 financial crisis. The tests are designed to see how banks would fare during a hypothetical extreme economic downturn (not unlike what banks experienced last year). This stress test is extremely important because last year, during the height of the pandemic, the Fed imposed restrictions on banks on capital distributions like dividends and buybacks in order to ensure banks would have enough capital to weather the storm. Thanks to those measures, plus low interest rates and government stimulus that held off loan losses, analysts expect banks to perform well on Thursday, which would lead the Fed to lift remaining capital distribution curbs, opening the floodgates for banks to increase dividends and reinstitute stock buy back programs. If these restrictions are fully lifted, the six largest banks in the US - Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup, Goldman Sachs (GS), JP Morgan (JPM), Morgan Stanley (MS) and Wells Fargo (WFC) - are expected to increase payouts by $66 billion to $130 billion over the next four quarters. This is huge.

Later this week, investors will receive the latest update on core personal consumption expenditures (PCE), which serves as the Fed's preferred gauge of inflation. The report due for release on Friday is expected to register a 3.4% year-on-year increase for May, marking the fastest jump since 1992, albeit while still reflecting ""base effects"" as prices rebound after last year's pandemic-induced collapse in prices across the boar

&gt;Microsoft Corp. took its place in the history books as just the second U.S. public company to reach a $2 trillion market value, buoyed by bets its dominance in cloud computing and enterprise software will expand further in a post-coronavirus world.
&gt;
&gt;Its shares rose as much as 1.1% to $265.64 on Tuesday in New York, enough for the software company to join Apple Inc. as one of only two companies trading at such a lofty value. Saudi Aramco eclipsed that threshold briefly in December 2019, but currently has a market value of about $1.9 trillion.
